Welcome to BBC parliament's live coverage of the House of Commons. In an hour's time the Treasury Minister Greg Clarke will respond to an urgent question from Labour on banking reform. Earlier today, the Chancellor, George Osborne, announced that the UK's big banks will be broken up if they fail to follow new rules to separate risky investment operations from high street outlets. The International Development Secretary will then update MPs on the humanitarian response to the current crisis in  Join me for a roundup of the day in both Houses of Parliament at 00pm this evening. First, questions to the local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and his  order. Questions to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Mr Dave Watts. Number one, Mr Speaker. With permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions one and 11  Spending on council tax benefit did double under the last administration and welfare reform is vital in tackling the inherited budget deficit from the last  Replacing council tax benefit with local support schemes does give councils control over how to achieve a 10% saving whilst also giving them a direct incentive to help local people into work. Mr  can the Minister explain that at a time when the governments are making massive tax cuts to the  that the council tax will increase for low paid families, disabled people and single mums in St Helens? Well, I hope he will make the case very clearly to his own local authority, at the moment are looking at a scheme that does not necessarily do its best to help local people into work. The point of this is we are giving local councils the power to be part of their economy, drive tkroet and -- growth and get people back to work. One council told a Select Committee that the reduction will create additional financial pressures through administration and debt collection and affects on services and huge huge effects on  Given Tory-controlled Croydon council, does his own friends recognise this is an ill- thought out cut? Cosh council will help -- Corby council will help  This is giving authorities power to look at what their communities need, deliver for their khaoupbts and it's up to communities hold their councils to account as I hope they will in Corby. Manchester City council can more than make up the loss of council tax benefits from empty and second  But instead, are planning to force thousands of people to pay extra council tax. Does the Minister agree with me that this is yet another example of Labour-run councils making wrong choices and attacking the vulnerable? The honourable gentleman makes a good  like the other authorities I have outlined, that's another Labour authority not putting local people first. They need to look at schemes again and put local people Thank you very much, Mr  In December, the Secretary of State tried to justify his plan to increase council tax bills for people on low incomes, including his own constituents. He assured the House that he had intervened to,  to protect people and ensure that nobody has to pay mover than -- pay more than 8.5%. Is it still the case that no one in Brentwood will have to pay more 5%? I think he gives another chance to highlight what we are doing is getting in control of a situation under the last Government council tax doubled, benefits for council tax went from around �4.5  This is a benefit that's got to be under control. The cuts and he has not even outlined yet.  no answer to a straight factual question. The answer is 20% in Brentwood. Why is it, because councils up and down the country, Tory and Labour, have been put in an impossible position by Ministers. Isn't the truth, Mr Speaker, that the very lowest paid are going to be in a very difficult place, not  but those of the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association. While the Secretary of State has been travelling up and down the country, lecturing councils about not increasing the council tax, all along he's been masterminding a council tax increase for those who can least afford it. Doesn't he understand that the public will see this happening in the very same month at the top rate of tax is cut and say this is unfair? I am afraid the right honourable gentleman gentleman oversimplifies things. He hasn't touched on, local authorities as we said, have the right to look at their communities, design schemes they think are right, not a central central dictat. The way they've changed the tape tore make sure it does pay to work. I will answer questions two and three  with permission. The Government has taken significant steps to help small retailers, including doubling the level of small business rates relief for a further year until March 2014. This will benefit half a million small and medium-sized businesses.  I am grateful for that  Business rates - small shops in my constituency, has his department carried out any analysis to acertain how many local authorities are using the powers provided in the local act to give diskreugsary rate relief to small businesses and if not what can be done to encourage them to use them more extensively?We are collecting that information right now and we will be presenting it to the House  I can say we have given new powers to councils to be able to provide further business rate  But also the flexality to be able to use them when and where they think is best and I would courage councils, whether in my friend's constituency or  to use those powers so they can better help their high  Small shops, a market town in my constituency suffered under the last Government's planning guidelines in terms of pushing up car parking charges and pushing  Could my honourable friend outline steps Government is taking to ensure under our guidelines car parking charges will be pushed downwards, not up? Thank  I can say we have scrapped Labour's red tape so councils can now be more far flexible around the way in which car parking work and associated rules and that will enable more people to be attracted to excellent towns in my honourable friend's constituency. I would urge councils to be more innovative in how they manage to make charging for parking. I see a number of instances where simple changes can make a real difference to our local high streets. The chief executive of the British property federation said the decision by the Government to delay revaluation until 2017 is a real shot in the food for the retail  Does he agree? No, I  I would say, as I have said to the federation on several  we have looked carefully at the valuation office evidence they presented to us and what they have shown is every three businesses who might gain, there are eight who could lose, including potentially 100 million to retailing in London. That's why we  I think, the correct decision to defer that revaluation until 2017. Undoubtedly business rates can be a burden on many small shops, but can I ask the Minister if he has had any discussion with his colleagues in Department of Work and Pensions, because as a result of the freezing of the benefits uprating at 1%, that will take �6 billion from local economies in this country out of those economies and that will hit small shops hardest, will it not? Disposable income is very  That's why I am proud that we are not a Government, unlike the party opposite, who doubled council tax bills when the duration of theirs office. That hits the disposable pound. It's a shame the party opposite didn't understand that in Government. Question four. With permission, I would like to answer questions four, 15 and 16 together. Fire and rescue authorities have been protected by - years three and four of the spending review period. This has provided time to meet the reductions without impacting on the quality of local services and there is scope for fire and rescue authorities to make sensible savings. In South Yorkshire we are losing 140 firefighters and currently advertising for contract part-time  not full-timers. Can the Minister give assurances that these actions and the restrictions on growth will not affect response times which could put lives at risk? As I am sure the honourable lady will appreciate local response times and decision-making are a matter for the local fire service. I am pleased to say that the - it has been protected and indeed south York hire itself will be receiving and extra �2.4 million in capital funding. Why is the Fire Authority areas with a higher incident rate suffering the largest cuts, the West Midlands fire and rescue service has been the hardest hit with cuts of nearly 19%. Will the Government not have another lock at that? The West Midlands fire service also benefits. It's also one of the authorities that's gained most from the capital funding of 11.5 million. Tire and Wear rescue service would have suffered reduction this year had it not been for the floor  Does the Minister believe the formula reflects the need and local risks required, given its reliance and will he review the formula now before it's  I believe it's a report from the House of Commons library that said the formula is actually - is fair to north and south and east  Wye say is to offer extra support to fire and rescue authorities in looking at savings, I have already asked the outgoing chief fire and rescue advisor to review the ways that fire and rescue authorities can deliver savings and improvements without reducing the quality of their life- saving work. Will the Minister join me in welcoming the introduction by Kent fire and rescue service to Medway of a new system that helps to I visited the area recently and saw something a bit of work to ensure that they protect people and also  such as sharing their call centre with police. I hope fire services across the country will look at that.The average spending power reductions for the Metropolitan Police is 4.5% and 5% for combined fire authorities, resulting in fewer appliances, fire station closures, reduction in prevention work and increased response times. Yet the Minister wrote to me last month to said that savings should be made without affecting frontline services. As Winston Churchill said, the truth is incontrovertible. Will the fire Minister accept the truth about his cups are adversely affecting frontline services? -- cuts? Let us reconfirm the ruction in spending power was minus to 0.2% for 2011 - 5% the following year and - 5% the following year and -  4.7 % and 3.3% next year. 7 % and 3.3% next year. I am sure 000 overcrowded families in social housing will welcome the increased availability of larger  bearing in mind some 390,000 families on to occupy their properties by two bedrooms or more. The department's assessment says more than 660,000 claims for housing benefit will be affected and it is ridiculous to assume they can find the money from their own pockets given The Cutts but will be forced to lose their homes. What assessment has been made of the availability of smaller accommodation? Whether just be extremely expensive private sector accommodation? -- will there. I have pointed out a very large number of properties that are currently under occupied and that will help enormously in a policy that is identical to the one adopted by the Labour government in respect of housing benefit being paid in the private sector. We are taking the advice of the Labour Party which was set one year ago, - - which said housing needs reform. Given the expected mid-term review statement on housing, would you look at the capacity of councils to borrow to facilitate the building of one and two-bedroom properties where they are needed by councils? My honourable friend will be aware that as a result of changes made by this Government in terms of borrowing pressures placed on local  they have had greater ability to borrow and in terms of the review currently being  we will look at those  According to the Government's assessment, most of the under occupied properties are in the North of England and the overcrowded properties are in the  Is the party strategy to move overcrowded Londoners to the north of England?

And where are the homes for families who have a son or daughter in the armed forces who are deemed to be over occupied because they keep that spare room for when they are on leave. They are not there, why does he abandoned this vindictive policy? The Government is well aware of these issues and that is why it in relation to the disabled people she talks about, we have placed an additional �25 million available to  In addition to carers, and additional �5 million.

Thank you. What assessment has my friend made of the �40 proposed Brown in tax by a Labour run derby council?There is a good case for comparing that tax neighbouring authorities such as Amber Valley. Which is about to introduce a new recycling service with more convenience for households and reducing land flow and that includes a free collection  I would encourage other councils to follow suit. A number Thank you. We have recently announced a significant package of improvements to support economic growth -- economic growth. We will continue to keep the system under Thank you. I was more after the changing of pubs to supermarkets, which requires no need for any change of use planning  As a minister any plans to introduce planning permission so that local people have some say in change abuse that significantly alters the community? -- change of  All authorities have the possibility of resorting to article 4 to restrict the application of change of use in their area. They could do so if they are concerned about the loss of pubs. Would my friend ensure that there are very clear planning guidelines introduced for five-year housing supplies and numbers and deliver ability because what is happening is the methodology is being arbitrarily decided upon on appeal and that is unsatisfactory when local authorities cannot make  Thank you. My Honourable Friend is absolutely right, it is important for me, authorities to take an objective approach to the assessment of housing aids and of the five-year supply. Lord Taylor is conducting a review of the complete planning guidance and up on his list is new guidance to produce an answer to that question before the end of July. At the  if local authorities refuse permission for yet another betting shop in their high street, they are very often overturned by planning  Is the Minister looking at the separate use class for betting shops?The Department for Culture Media and support is reviewing the whole situation regarding betting shops and we have no specific plans to do that at The Minister is right that local authorities can and should introduce local planning policy to do with these problems. Can I ask him to join my confirmation at the extraordinary decision by the British Beer and Pub Association to overturn Cambridge City Council's elected policy for pubs when that is what the council and the people want? If the City of Cambridge's policy was arrived at as an expression of local feeling, I'm sure they will be able to defend that from any  No. 8.

If you look at the figures, the scheme which gives waiting to deprivation is essentially unchanged from the Labour Party's game and in one respect we have introduced bandied  Which means that those more dependent on grants and those who are less so, they receive more protection than those who are more  I think it is fair to say that the settlement is more progress of -- more progressive and gives more waiting to deprivation and Labour did.When the announcement was made, can he confirm that it should have been 6% because of " did sport money and can he confirm that the cash handed over to local authorities 4% less than the form of a grant which it replaces this year? Can you simply stop pretending that cats can be managed without hitting frontline services?  I want to confirm that the reduction in spending power isn't 7, it is actually 1.3. That represents good use. Figures do tend to move about... That is why we have this provisional settlement and I don't know why you are  Under several supplements, things changed dramatically and in one year the party opposite had to go to consultation again.

That is why we have given additional sums to help those areas that are more reliable. That is why a place like Newcastle will receive �600 per household more than  That is the sensible thing to do. The honourable gentleman should be supporting that We have confirmed the increase in waiting and top-ups we proposed at consultation. We are proeut providing a grant to support the delivery to sparsely populated areas for efficiencies in services. May I welcome my honourable friend's recognition that the provision of services in rural communities like the Malden district where populations are sparsely distributed, often cost  But does he understand the disappointment that the local Government finance settlement appears to do little to reduce the rural penalty, indeed it actually entrenches it for the forthcoming years? What Wye say to my honourable friend is that we do recognise the concerns of rural areas such as Malden and similar areas where costs are clear. The 5 million we have outlined in the statement today will go to 95 local authorities all of whom are  I would also point out that in the meetings with myself and officials have had with people in rural - - we have been able to confirm the gap is narrowing thanks to changes made in the settlement and that gap is getting narrow than it ever was under the previous Government who clearly - finance is in a situation which affected rural areas across our country. Those funds are welcome. Is the Minister aware in his department's own analysis Shire districts such as Watford Watford Borough Council count as rural, why unitaries including Wiltshire are lumped in  Given that, how can he be sure of the boasts that this proposed settlement is fair to rural and urban alike? I am quite happy to meet with the honourable gentleman to go through the  We have confirmed with the rural network actually that across all types of authorities the gap between rural and urban has narrowed as a result of this  Number ten, Mr Speaker. Council and police have a range of strong powers to take action against illegal and unauthorised  We recently reminded councils of their extensive powers at their disposal to deal with these problems swiftly.  Over the summer a group of travellers moved back and fortth between sites in Croydon costing thousands of pounds. What else can the Government do to help councils tackle this antisocial behaviour? In particular, will you look at hroeuing councils to use buy-laws on private and public land? There are already significant powers exist, and particularly the police have powers to deal with people that are causing a public nuisance and consistently making illegal encampments and I draw attention to the Criminal Justice Act and put the criminal justice and Public Order Act 1994 which gives the police considerable powers to deal with this. In addition to which, we are consulting on the possibility of temporary stop notice, to give immediate effect which will put considerable powers in the hands of the local council.  Mr Speaker. With  I would like to answer questions 12 and 14 together. Over the last 15 years or more, this country has been building half the homes we need. This Government is determined to reverse that trend by reforming the planning system, by expanding the private rented sector and by building 170,000 more affordable homes. There are thousands on the housing waiting list in Rochdale and homelessness is rising. Like Rochdale residents, does the Minister not regret his Government's decision to cut the affordable housing budget by 60%?  Mr Speaker, when you lock at the number of 19.5 million this is an important investment, not least to try to reverse the fall we saw in social housing under the last Government as some 421,000  We clearly want to build 000 but a long way to go before we can clear up the mess that we have inherited. Can I draw attention to my interests as declared in the  The Minister over the last few weeks has been answering some interesting questions. And providing data about the new homes  He, I am sure, will have looked at the figures as closely as I have and he will know that this is not only very expensive, but a complete failure. Will he recognise that the 17 local authorities receiving the largest amount of new homes bonus are not only not granting more planning permissions than they were, but substantially  37% below the levels of 2005- 6 and below the levels of last  Mr Speaker, some of the questions were from the right honourable gentleman, whether they were interesting or not is another  I would say to him, if I  what he needs to understand is the principle of new homes bonus is  the more you build, the more you get. That is why in Manchester, in Sheffield and  we see they've shown the  They're willing to do that and that's why we recognise there will be at least 400,000 additional homes as a direct result of this bonus. Would the Minister agree more authorities should take the approach of authorities such as rugby Borough Council Which has allocated land with to sites to enable the development of 75 00 new homes? I very much welcome that. What's important to see is the way in which some thofrts are -- authorities are being proactive in the way they handle planning system, the way in which they're engaged in new homes bonus. We have a shared ambition to overturn something that's happened for the last 20  I wish sometimes the party opposite would be more positive  In the context of housing  does he agree that plans and developers of grotesque schemes such as proposed 1600 homes estate in my constituency to be accessed by a one mile cul-de-sac should be forced to live there for a minimum of five years as a condition of any planning consent? I think the safest answer are to me is that is a very novel idea and I will reflect on it in due course.  the Secretary of State told the BBC that on house-building signs are encouraging, boasting of building 132,000 homes. Encouraging? Far from encouraginging housing completionions have falling in years since Labour left office and housing starts have fallen to 000, does the Minister recognise those figures? He should, because they come from his own department. Will he take this opportunity of correcting the misleading impression given by the Secretary of State and does he not accept that no amount of massaging statistics can conceal the fact that this is a Government presiding over the biggest housing crisis in a generation? Gosh, well a lot of rhetoric there but not a lot of  The reality is the net addition to the housing stock is up 11% on the last figures that we  135,000. That is the highest  Mr Speaker, in four years. Is there more to do? Absolutely. Do we want to make sure that we reverse the trepd on affordable  But carping on the other side won't help that process, nor the people the party opposite claim to represent.

We are going to make sure they can put them into practice. I notice in the Minister's answer the absence of one for one like- for-like replacements, could he clarify that and perhaps give information to the House or put it in the library the number of right to buy properties that have been sold and the number that have been built as replacement units. I am happy to clarify the situation. In the last six months the records that we have 86 million has been recycled from those sales back into affordable homes. Wye have thought the honourable gentleman would welcome that fact.  Mr Speaker.We are providing local authorities with 448 million over three years, including funding for family co- ordinators in all 152 upper tier  My troubled families team have recently published a report on effective family intervention and the significant cost-saving that can work and could I say this would not have been possible without the active encouragement of members of  including all sides of this House. Is my right honourable friend aware that my local council has been doing excellent work and that Barnet Council has identified one troubled family which is benefiting 000 a year from the public  What additional help can the Government give to councils like Barnet to tackle this problem? My honourable friend was leader of Barnet Council, - an early adopter of this intervention model. It isn't that money is spent wisely, the majority is just simply spent on reaction to the troubled family, rather than positively getting on  As I said, thanks to the work of my honourable friend and friends around this chamber, I think we can actually jointly say that we have made a significant progress with regard to troubled families.  would the Secretary of State agree with me that those of us on all sides of the House who want to see this policy come to fruition and work well are finding on the grass roots very difficult, especially in an area I know well  people in schools are saying it's very difficult to get a - the work programme, with the  across the agencies and the  will he talk to colleagues in other departments to make this a success? There is an understanding of the need for co- operation across Government. If the hopb hrabl gentleman -- hopb honourable gentleman has a particular local authority in mind, if he would write to me or speak to me I will personally intervene. Number 18, Mr Speaker. Excessive payouts to senior local authority staff have been too  Thanks to the localism act taxpayers can now see and challenge how their sphupb being spent on pay and reward including  We are also scrapping regulations that saw councils pay out inflated sefrage packages to chief executives in order to avoid lengthy review process.When the chief executive of Tory Kent County Council left after 16 months with a 000 pay out the then local Government Minister, now Tory Party  described this as disturbing and I find dipping into the public purse to make such an eye-watering pay-off unacceptable. Shortly thereafter, his Cabinet Office colleague hired this individual as director general of civil service reform. Does he think this sets a good example? I think the hopb honourable gentleman outlined why the changes we are making are so needed. Number 19, Mr Speaker. Grant reductions to fire and rescue authorities are backloaded in the spending review period allowing them to make sensible savings without impacting on the quality of local services. Rightly operational activities are decided by each  subject to their own local consultation.  I declare an indirect interest in the interests of the right honourable member for Greenwich and Woolwich. Can the Minister explain on 6th December during a visit to Taunton he seemed impressed with a plan to make significant savings through efficiencies and fuel savings by purchasing the light rescue pumps and when push came to shove the fire service ravaged by cuts are trying to find innovative ways to reduce costs were told, sorry, you can't have those pumps. Can he explain why he changed his mind in the space of a few weeks? I had a very good visit as the honourable lady outlined to Somerset and seeing some of the plans of how they want to take things forward is what many authorities across this country should be looking at. It's also why Devon and Somerset will be receiving �2.7 million of capital money in 2013-15. Number 20, Mr Speaker. I published a document called 50 ways to save with no less than a - 50 great ideas for sensible savings that councils can adopt. Our fair funding deal and council tax freeze will give all councils time to put these ideas into practice. Wye like to thank the Secretary of State for visiting Cheshire over the weekend and I was wondering if he could share what guidance Hayes department is giving to local authorities such as Cheshire West and Chester to help identify wasteful spending? Well, it was indeed a pleasure to visit Cheshire over the weekend and see so many active Conservatives. I think we have done that by setting an  My own department's procurement spend has come down by  My Government's procurement card has decreased by 87%. Spending on technology dropped by 69%. We recognise that it's not our money but the public's money and unlike those opposite we have been If it costs authorities over �200 million over five years because the government forces them to publish statutory notices in local papers, rather than online, while what he not allowed local authorities to make the sensible saving? -- why will he not alive.This is something we are considering what we need to bear in mind the importance to the local economy of local newspapers and we have made clear to allow local editors at the days in which these notices appear in newspapers are numbered. Mr Gordon Henderson. A written statement has been made detailing the final local government financial settlement, despite the needs to tackle the Labour deficit, councils were last year's spending �114 billion and the overall reduction in spending will take into account the new health care funding grant and that is just 1.3%. Decentralised reforms in that council tax income will now be raised locally and councils are in the driving seat to help firms and support local jobs. My friend has often said that planning law should treat all applicants in the same  That being the case, will the undertake to write to the planning department and make it clearer their responsibilities to determined in the same way applications from the settled and travelling communities and refer officers to the document in which that is set out? Of course, that is the case and I am sure that my honourable friend, the planning  has heard what has been said and we were clear in wanting to ensure that the travelling committee gets a fair deal and we have been doing all kinds of things relating to commercial dealings, education and health but what is important is that they should be treated with the same respect as the rest of the population. Can the Minister can the House how many additional affordable homes he expects to approve and how many affordable homes are likely to be lost through changes to growth and infrastructure and is a minister going to reduce -- produce figures to show the impact of these contradictory policies?The honourable Lady asked three questions and abort answer all of them all in full but she would be aware that the measures of Grove tackle those developments of affordable housing that will never happen in current market conditions and we believe that some homes is better than an unrealistic target of homes that will never come true. She will be aware of that at the same time as the measures in the  we announced an additional �300 billion to support further affordable housing so there is a question of this will produce an net increase in market and affordable homes. Last week, Warwickshire council announced an initiative to give local business groups the opportunity to bid for 000 to develop ideas for people to shop in town centres. Will the Minister congratulate the counter council and will he detail what support the Government is giving to improve town centres? I am happy to join my friend in congratulating the council but what I would say is that we have a settled programme looking at strengthening the way in which the planning system works to make sure business rates are reduced for the smallest firms but the key issue is the question of how to ensure high streets adapt to the new world of online shopping. Consumer habits have changed and we stand ready to work with high streets to adapt. All Saturday, I met with Newcastle youth council to discuss the report on the impact of the Secretary of State's �100 million of cuts to the council budget. They explained how many children could not understand the magnitude of the cuts and were offering to give up sweets Ardowen at pocket money to save local  swimming pools and youth  Does the Secretary of State understand the magnitude of his cuts and the impact on young people end Newcastle? -- in  Perhaps you are not  in fact, the spending power reduction in Newcastle is lower than the national average and there will be 2500 per dwelling and she will welcome the additional �2 million of new homes bonuses that went to her local authority. I friend will agree that local authorities need to balance budgets by making efficiency savings but does he concur that billing residents for fights to China, external consultancy fees and self- aggrandising great energy some it's one not inspire sympathy if families see an increase in their rates? I friend makes a very  In these difficult  When councils expect to play their part in reducing the deficit, it is sometimes difficult to say, to explain why councillors have been using this money. I hope that the council's will take heed. -- There are 8000 families on my transfer lists and Conservative policies will force thousands of low income Londoners to seek accommodation elsewhere. Is a policy not just an just but a recipe for social chaos? -- not just unjust. These changes were made clear to councils and it isn't right to see people being dumped in large groups from their home. That is why we change the law so that they have to take into account the suitability for each individual and dumping is something we shall With the number of empty homes falling by over 21,000 in  the biggest drop since 2004, would My friend agree that local solutions supported by central government provide the best means of tackling this long-standing problem? My honourable friend recognises the success our policy is having an she is right that local decisions are the best way forward and that is why we have given the ability to local councils to increase tax on empty properties as introducing the new Homs bonus. -- whilst introducing the new homes That Select Committee on welfare reform said a housing provider in the universal pilots game reported they would lose one proposed new-build property per week from the development programme because of welfare reform. Has he assessed the impact of reform on the ability of providers to build new homes and could you tell us how many new homes will not be built? The honourable lady asks from a difficult position, from a government that lost just 400 and had to 1000 social homes.

Urgent question, Mr Chris Leslie.  can I ask the Minister to make a statement about the Government's approach to banking  I call the Minister. Mr  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Government today has laid before the House the financial services banking reform bill and also its response to the report of the parliamentary commission on banking standards which was published on 21st December last  following that commission's pre-legislature scrutiny of a draft  I pay tribute to the members of both the independent commission on banking and the parliamentary  The two Commissions whose membership comprises some of the most distinguished policy- makers and intellects in the world have shaped a set of reforms to banking that will leave the world and set an example to other countries in the seriousness, radicalism and meticulousness of the changes proposed. The bill which is published today reflects their pain-staking work and the Government has accepted almost all of their recommendations. The reforms address what the Chancellor has called the British dilemma. How Britain can be a leading global financial centre with more than its fair share of international trade and financial services. While at the same time not exposing ordinary working people in this country to the catastrophic risks of banks  These reforms were and are necessary because the previous regime was tested and failed. UK taxpayers had to bail out the banks with �65 billion of money of ordinary working people, while those wh had taken a one-pay bet  losing nothing more than you their jobs and sometimes not even that. The anger the country feels must be channelled into change to reset Britain's banking system. The objective of the bill proposed by Vickers and endorsed by the Commission is that any failure of any bank in the future should not impose a cost on the taxpayer and not interrupt for a second vital banking services. That is a high ambition, but one that's appropriate for a country with the reputation for financial stability and confidence that has for centuries been one of Britain's chief assets in the world. As is well known the bill will ringfence around the core the operation. Within that ring fence banks must be insulated from activities such as using depositors' funds to speculate in capital markets. As a result of the commission's recommendations, the Government is making a number of further changes to the bill. First, in the honourable member for Chichester's acute phrase, which will permanently enter the lexicon of  the ringfence will be electrified. Directors will be personally responsible for ensuring that their banks comply with the ring-fencing rules and the Prudential regulation authority will conduct an annual review of the operation anded a kwasy of the ring-fenced rules. Second, there are explicit provisions on the face of the bill for the principle aspects of ring-fencing, including that there should be separate boards of directors, remuneration arrangements, Treasury management operations, balance sheet management and human resource management of ring-fenced banks.  the bill gives an opportunity to make an historic change in the competitive environment in UK banking. Competition is essential to ensure that customers benefit from  demanding customer service and efficiency from their  That has not always been customers' experience in the past. As well as bringing in a seven-day automatic account switching service from September this year, the Government will take steps to tackle the cosy arrangement where the banks determine how payment systems will be run. Why should it be necessary in 2013 for a cheque to take six days to clear with the  not the customers, scooping up the interest on the balance during this delay? Why should a bank have to beg an incouple pwept bank for permission to use the  We will require fair, reasonable and transparent. The kpheugts has quite rightly emphasised the importance of competition and I am grateful to it for propoling this drive further as I am to my honourable friend the member for south and north Hampshire shire. The fourth change, final change s that more parliamentary scrutiny will be built into the secondary legislation that implements what is a high level bill. Drafts of the principle strategy instruments to be made will be made available to the House before the second reading of this Bill. The Government accepts the recommendations of the Dell indicated powers committee on the type of scrutiny each should  -- receive. These are historic reforms but it's appropriate in our country in which we have an industry in which directly and indirectly two million people work which is our biggest export earner, which which contributes �1 in every eight of our tax revenue, that we should take steps necessary to restore confidence in and to an industry which has fallen so far. There is much scrutiny of the bill before us, both here and in the House of Lords. I look forward very much to our discussions during the weeks and months ahead. Mr Speaker f the Government believed this issue was really  wouldn't the Chancellor have made a statement to the House of Commons about it today? It Shouldn't take an urgent question for particlement to hear why the Government is taking a half-hearted approach to banking reform, in a week when our national banks are facing record-breaking fines for LIBOR manipulation, when the FSA are struggling to get a fair deal on PPI mis-selling and for small businesses whose customers have been mis-sold interest rate, hedging products, in a a -- week we see bonus season continuing to roll on for banking executives as if nothing has happened, in a week when all this suggests we should be getting serious about real reform, what is it that the Chancellor has said in his seaside speech today? He's fudged the tough stance recommended by the Vickers report. He's stopped short on the back stop powers and the legislation for the hrfrage ratio envisaged by the parliamentary commission on banking  a commission which the Chancellor himself agreed to set up last summer. I have to ask the  why does it feel as though the Chancellor has to be dragged kicking and screaming towards serious reform? Is it  despite all the rhetoric and the feigned concern they know they face certain defeat on the House of Lords on the sensible recommendations of the parliamentary commission and best to try and salvage something from what is in reality a centre strategic retreat. Can I ask the Minister why won't he legislate for a full reserve power for total separation of retail and investment banking if ring-fencing doesn't work? Something we called for last year and the parliamentary commission specifically recommended. Surely it would be sensible to legislate now, not just if one or two individual banks misbehaviour, but in case ring-fencing fails the  He may think he's found a cunning ploy but stopping short with only half the back stop powers just means it's unlike ly to be  There will be corporate lawyers across the City rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of taking on the regular litter on a case by case baser and why is he ducking the main conclusion of of the Vickers report? Specifically, why is he refusing to adopt the commission recommendations on the leverage ratio and reign in the overexposure of banks whose excessive reusening- taking caused it in the first place? Does he agree that the implementation of the Bill needs a full parliamentary review on a regular basis with genuine scrutiny of the detailed secondary legislation on exactly how ring- fencing will work in practice? If the commission recommend a tougher  proper professional qualifications and duty of care for customers together with stronger controls on bonuses and remuneration, will he accept their judgment in this bill and with the economy flatlining and no plan for  why is there nothing in the bill to improve the funding for lending scheme.? We shouldn't still be seeing lending to businesses falling further and further, month  The Minister has to realise that the public, taxpayers and parliament want to tackle this issue once and for all. The bill needs further amendment and if they don't have the courage to radically reform the banks, then we will.  Mr Speaker. I'd rather hoped for a serious response to a a serious matter. I hope when we go to committee the honourable gentleman with whom I am happy to work on the details of the bill will be able to make more substantial reflections than he was able to offer the House today.  Mr Speaker, the idea that the opposition should have the brass neck to table an urgent question on banking reform is almost unbelievable. At no point in in 13 years in power did the party opposite show a stiller of urge The system they introduced has played a large part in the burden that the ordinary working people are still having to shoulder today, having to bail out the banks. Nor after the crisis. They were in office after the crisis crisis. Even then they did nothing urgent apart from plunging its head in the sand to hope the nightmare would  It's fallen to this Government as it does so very  to urgently clear up the chaos that Labour has left this  It shouldn't have taken the time that it did, but since this Government has been elected from the beginning of our tenure in  we set up the independent commission on banking, it's done a  We have created a separate conduct regulator and protkepbgs regulator. Why did we need to wait for the Government to be elect to do that? Why didn't they set up a parliamentary Commission on banking standards? Of course I will answer the pitiful few points that the honourable gentleman made. The honourable gentleman asks a reasonable  why we haven't given the Bank of England a power to split up the system? One of the principle reasons we haven't done that was that the governor of the pwhreupg in evidence -- Bank of England in evidence said he didn't want that power T would seem odd to foist a power he doesn't want to have. The honourable member asks why we didn't follow the back stop ratio he mentioned. One of the concerns that was expressed was from building societies that they would If you read the response, he would know we will have a full review conducted of the ring-fencing rules and we will act on any recommendations that has. Further recommendations that might come from my honourable friend's commission also. The honourable gentleman seemed surprised that we might be interested in taking seriously these recommendations. Hopefully it is apparent that we take very seriously these recommendations and look forward to further recommendations, particularly on competition. I respect the work of the Commission and look forward to making time available when the next report is published to make whatever changes we need to to accommodate the recommendations.The commission it carefully at the detail the Government has published but I warmly welcome this acceptance of a number of key proposals, including the electrification of the ring  Journalists were briefed last night by the Treasury that the Government has accepted our proposal as an external assessment to be made before the reserve powers are exercised but there is no mention in the government  Could the Minister confirm that such an assessment will be provided for in legislation? Of course and I pay tribute to my friend and the members of this House who are members of this house. It may not be known just how many hours of the day they work on this and they do great service to the country. We Accept My friend's recommendation and this is a higher level bill and we will bring forward amendments to reflect those recommendations and we will invite him to consider whether they appropriately addressed those recommendations. I welcome the change of heart announced by the Chancellor today which is in contrast to the somewhat dismissive noises that came out of the Government when the report was published. I'm sure that change of heart will have nothing to do with the provision of amendments being supported by one of his predecessors, Lord Lawson, the former Cabinet Secretary and the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Can ask the Minister of why the speech today it was silent on the Commission recommendations for a general reserve power for the sector as a whole. I must correct  this is something that should not be any decision left to the Bank of England. I extend my thanks  who has served with distinction on that committee. It is in response to the question that he makes about that power. I mentioned that the Bank of England did not want that power and that may not be the choice for them. It seems to me that to have the power to break up any individual bank is a very strong one and quite rightly, as his commission recommended, does make more impenetrable the ring  To have reserve power to change the whole system is, in  a different policy and I understand the reasons. But I think that if we were to get to the point of changing the whole policy, that deserves the scrutiny of a bill of its own and it would be free for any future government to introduce  But to have this as a rider to any Bill to implement the because report is wrong. In terms of accepting amendments, many members had served on committees in the past and throughout the passage of  we need to listen to sensible suggestions. And not treat this exercise as one of partisanship but to find consensus on the best system for word. Is my honourable friend confident that the very welcome proposals he has announced one not be swept away by some tsunami of regulations bearing down upon us from Europe? Even though none of those create any single opportunity for financial- services and businesses to trade on the Continent and that all result in the transfer of power to Europe to regulate our most important  My honourable friend is right when talking about our most important industry, certainly in terms of experts. It is significant that more euros are treated in this country than across the entirety of the eurozone. And we need to continue to have access to the single market and to argue, as we  to make sure that we secure  That is a constant fight but I know that me and my honourable friend will always take that fight with us to Brussels. As a member of the commission, we will examine the details concluded in the Bill but I have to say that the honourable gentleman reasons -- the honourable gentleman's reasons to require further explanation. The reason being that the Chancellor said that our commission ought not to UN pick consensus and having taken evidence from a wide range of  academics, bankers and  who have all supported the recommendations on an actor find the ring fence, when the Minister give serious consideration again to the recommendations that we have made? -- will have the Minister. I do take those recommendations seriously but this isn't a matter that is a difference between just the Government and the Commission, the Shadow Chancellor himself said earlier that there was no need to break up institutions but there must be clear separation. People across all sides have come to the same view on this but I am respectful of those contributions. If break up and segregation may be necessary for banks in future  why doesn't the Government understand it might need those techniques for the serious banking crisis we are living through, preventing the full recovery? Will the Government look at what it can learn to sort out the problem of RBS today? My honourable friend makes a forceful point and the legislation is about the future and it is right that it should be proceeding with consideration and that they do not introduce things that might have unintended consequences without consideration in this house. The Government is a major shareholder in RDS and it is important that should be returned quickly to the private hands. That isn't the current situation. And he shares our ambition for that. It is right the taxpayer should never again be on the hook for bad decisions taken by investment banks or bad regulation. I welcome ring- fencing and the provision to separate any given back if  But I am not convinced yet by the need for the reserve powers to separate any bank but can the Minister tell the House, does he envisage any circumstances that when the Government might include the provision, the reserve provision to separate the bank in this for future legislation? I confess that I did not quite understand the point, whether he was objecting to the power to separate any particular bank or if it was the general point but we can talk about this afterwards. It is important that the regulator, the Bank of England, should have the  that if any bank breaches the rules and does not respect the ring fence, it will have consequences. Full separation. Would my friend agree that what consumers and businesses want to see is the existing banking sector to receive the hot blast of  We made a regulatory regime that allows new entrants, especially community-based biking, and social enterprises. And might one of those come from the break-up of the state-controlled RDS? I honourable friend and myself agree on the need for more competition in  It is one of the features of the financial crisis that it has resulted in concentration in banks. There were never enough in the first place but we need to seize more entrant banks coming in from all types and we are working with the existing authorities and through the Reyes -- through these  which will transform the state of competition. And it forward to seeing an infusion of new energy and talent into the  The highest high-street lending rates in the European Union and at the same time, the lowest high-street savings rates in the European Union. Why is he not coming forward not just with breaking up RBS but also Lloyds-TSB to create immediate, proper competition in the banking sector? The honourable gentleman one of knowledge that the government has promoted the sale of Northern Rock, to try to encourage new entrants and he will see more of that in  Interest rates, the rates being paid for mortgages and small business loans are very much lower than they would have been had they not been taking action necessary through the economy to keep them competitive.The British Bankers Association has said this morning that the ring-fenced electrification might cause uncertainty in the City but do you not agree that those banks that need to be worried about their future are those that try to order will underneath the fence? Absolutely right, any bank can have certainty that they will not be subject to being broken up if they respect the ring fence and it is important that we can't all have the trust and confidence in the British banking system on which the credibility of that system depends. These reforms recommended by Sir John because and his commission do precisely that. Isn't the truth that the bank failing to take those  the Chancellor has just raised the ring-fence by 1 mm. Why what the full implement -- recommendations be implemented?  it is the behaviour of any bank that is going to cause problems and the sanctions against that are very clear. But the bank beaches the ring-fence established, it will be split up. That is as clear as day to the directors of every bank, who will have a personal responsibility to respect the ring fence. About 650 people work for Lloyds TSB in Southend and similar for RBS. 20 branches each. Would my friend agree that this banking reform is just as much about helping the home of the UK and isn't just about the square miles of the City and Canary Wharf? Absolutely right. One of the real tragedy is and what makes me angry about the reputation of banking in recent years is that up and down the country, many hundreds of thousands of people who work in banks and had chosen banking as a career because of its associations with probity and respect and the type of work that it gets, those repetitions have been besmirched by a very small number and they are helpless in restoring the  This is as much to allow them to go to the pub without being rude about the fact the work  which should never have happened to them. My constituents are banks that serve industry and the community and not themselves. Can I try the Minister again on full reserve powers? Why should the evidence of one institution hold sway on this very expert commission? That is the objective of the honourable Lady, that banks should serve customers. That is precisely what Sir John had in mind and that is the purpose of the  That is what I want to  Any bank that strays from that, any ring-fenced bank, that will take money and play in a casino, Could the Minister outline in a little bit more detail how this will actually work? I will certainly pass on his comments to my right honourable friend the  What we are saying when it comes to the regulation of payment systems is that we will set up through the bill a regulatory responsibility to promote competition on the part of the regulator of payment systems, one of the things they will want to look at is how they can quickly make accounts portable between  But that's only one of the innovations they can make. I mentioned in my response to the urgent question, the requirement to speed up the clearing of cheques. He will recall that the payments council once introduced a statement to the cheques would be abolished  What kind of contempt for the consumer does that show? It It shouldn't happen again and it won't happen again. Why are we not just nationalising and making them into a good public  after all, we do own half of them?  as a result of the chaos of the previous Government, we almost end up nationalising them. I want to see our banks back in the private sector, to see them competitive, making money. And providing jobs and getting credit to businesses and consumers. The FSA says one of the reasons RBS failed was political pressure put on the regulator to ignore the risks banks were taking. It names the Shadow Chancellor as one of three - what checks are in place now to secure that doesn't happen again and has he had an apology from the Shadow Chancellor? Mr  one of the principle innovations we had was to get rid of the Shadow Chancellor who was then in a position to make that interference. The reason that we are setting up the system that we  the reason that we are giving powers to the Bank of England, to the regular litter, is to make it very clear that any bank that breaches the rules can forget about lobbying Ministers, they will be responsible to the Bank of England who will enforce the law, that I hope this House will see fit to pass. Taking the Minister back to the question posed by the member for Wolverhampton south-east, in simple  what possible reason does the Government have for not accepting the commission's recommendations of taking that reserve power? After all, if only banks who do not conform with the Government's wishes will have anything to fear from the reserve powers so why not take that power?  I have explained a number of occasions why we haven't. One reason is that the regulator doesn't want to have that power. The second reason is that it is more appropriate it seems to us, to have individual banks feel the consequences of their breach. The system itself doesn't have a mind to breach the rules. It's individual banks that do. It's appropriate that the sanctions should apply to individual banks. In addition to the electrification of the ring-fence, has the Minister considered adding perhaps barbed  in that we should look at the depositor preference, that deposits rank above bond holders to give extra security. What are the Government's thoughts on that?We agree with my honourable friend and they will be part of the bill.  Mr Speaker. The Minister is absolutely right to say that the reputation of our banks has never been lower and we hope that we start to see the important change that we need. One of the reasons for this reputation is the experience that many small businesses have had in terms of the interest rate swap agreement. Now whilst there is some - many people welcome the FSA announcement on  There is still some concerns about the exact - whether people consider they have justice at the end of this process. Can the Minister confirm what representations he made to the FSA during their deliberations as to what they should find and give any assurances as to why the interest rate swaps problems we had in the past won't reappear in the future? The honourable friend raises an important point. I met with the Federation of Small Businesses and organisation and on sroeued their concerns to the FSA, set up to be the independent regulator. Most people were relieved that the proposals that the FSA made last week are going to result in a compensation for businesses that have been affected in a rapid timeframe. It's totally unacceptable, it's another feature of the scandalous decline in reputation that banks have suffered, that in phrr for small businesses, who I think have a right to regard their bank manager as someone that acts in their interests, not someone that flogs them dodgy products that they don't need in the firs place, that's a breach of trust in banking. I am insistent the FSA should conclude this  giving full reexpense to all of those that have been mis- sold -- recon expense. The real game changer will be introducing full bank account number portability because that will break up the banks. Does my friend agree that it will be important also that the payments council should not any longer be controlled by the big banks? Breaking open competition, getting new challenge banks in is absolutely key.  I am grateful for the question and I again thank her for the effort she's made in promoting  It seems if you want to have genuine competition people should have a choice of banks and it should be easy, not difficult, for them to make those changes. The work that my honourable friend is doing I hope will be reflected in the policies that we are putting into this bill and I look forward to detailed discussions with her as to how we might do that. Thank you,  If the public are to have confidence in this new system, they need to know that lawyers or bankers will not be able to Circumvent the regime. Can the Minister come up with a better justification than he has so far as to why the Government should not take a full reserve power for full separation in order to protect the public? The honourable gentleman is right that you need to protect the ring- fence from the ingeneral ity of lawyers sometimes around there. The history of financial regulation has been that banks will will been able to discover ways of Circumventing  We have given robust powers to the regulator to insist on the full separation of any bank into retail and investment who makes any attempt to breach those rules. Can the Minister confirm that under this Government the taxpayer will never be required again to bail out the banks while a minority of bankers are picking up huge bonuses? Mr Speaker, I agree, both parts of the question. Mr Speaker, the Minister says that he wants to set up new bodies to set bonuses and pays within the bank. Can he guarantee that on those boards will be ordinary customers and businesses and that they won't be stacked out with bankers' friends? Tkoeu think it's important that the responsibility that's exercised by remuneration committees in particular has regard to the experience of ordinary working people up and down this country. I see no reason why the way that bonuses are thought about in the boardrooms in the City should be any different from how they're thought about in any other industry in this country.Thank you, I welcome the Minister's statement that confirms the Government's policy about ring-fencing the banks, in particular, extending it to electrifying that ring-fence. Does my honourable friend also agree some of the products or derifetives from banks can offer certainty and security to retail customers, particularly, for example, fixed rate mortgage and we need an intelligent debate around this  My friend's right. We have had that intelligent debate. In  the Government asked the Commission to look into this in particular and to make recommendations. The Commission has given an interim view that it's reasonable as my honourable friend  that simple derifetives should be provided from within the ring-fenced bank but it wanted to reflect further on whether any of its inquiries into the culture of banking might have implications for  So we will await the final conclusions of the Commission on that matter. With the merger of banks we have seen many regional bankss and building societies go and losing the investments that they would make on a local hrefpl. I wondered if the Minister could explain how this bill will enable areas like Yorkshire to benefit and it won't just be the south-east to benefit from the increasing in banks? An excellent point, I would like very much to see banks, in  in our great regional cities as used to be the case, banks that can take tkoss -- deposits from local people and establish that connection. So far, it's been very difficult for new banks to obtain a banking license within a reasonable period and to satisfy the regulatory requirements. We are doing everything we can to lower those barriers to entry so that we can achieve exactly what the honourable lady describes.  Mr Speaker. I welcome this proposal and the fact that we are taking on the bully banks on interest rate swaps and clearing up the big banks which have had grave deficiencies for some considerable  Does the Minister agree with me that this bill will also make it easier to create the local regional banks that we need to give the competition access to finance and community trust that we are trying to establish in places like the north-east where we are proposting a bank for there?

It is essential that the governments of these countries receive adequate support for their efforts from the international community. I also commend the UN for its strong leadership at the international humanitarian response and the partnerships that it's built. Its efforts have kept thousands of people sheltered and fed every month in contested Government and opposition-held areas in Syria and over a million children protected against life-threatening diseases like measles and polio. These achievements are a reminder of the UN's capacity and reach if given  political and financial support. And demonstrate that the UK's confidence in the multilateral aid system has not been misplaced. At the Kuwait conference I announced another �50 million of new UK aid towards the UN appeals and that was in addition to �21 million that I announced on 26th January during my visit to Jordan. �10 million of which was specifically for Jordan. It brings the UK's total humanitarian support for the Syrian crisis to �139.5  Mr Speaker, I am pleased to report that the successful outcome of the conference. As well  more than 60 countries participated in the pledging conference and raised over over 5 billion, exceeding the target. I very much welcome the generosity that was shown by donors, particularly those from the Gulf  Together, Kuwait, Saudi  and the united Arab Emirates pledged $900 million alone. I should take this opportunity to again thank the Amir of Kuwait for hosting such an important  I also commend my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary for the support provided by his department in lobbying donor countries to attend the conference. The next priority for my department is to see that these pledges are turned into tangible commitments, so that the UN, the human humanitarian agencies can scale up their activities and provide the kind of food, shelter, health and medical care that's urgently needed by the millions of men, women and children affected by the crisis.  while the Kuwait conference was a real success, we must be realistic. More than one- and-a-half billion dollars raised will actually only support the humanitarian response until June The shocking level of suffering will keep on rising whilst this conflict continues. A political settlement is needed. The UK remains said fast in our support for the joint UN Arab League special representative in his work towards political settlements and transition process and it is vital that a humanitarian response be given agreement to increased access to all areas of the country, including the ability to rich people in need across conflict  And from neighbouring  Until this happens, pockets of need will persist, despite the best efforts. The dire humanitarian situation deserves the continued support of this Government and I submit my department to this effort. Can I thank the Secretary of State in advance of a statement. We differ on many things but I want to begin by paying tribute to her for the important work she has done to galvanise the international response to the crisis arising from the conflict in Syria. She deserves support from all sides of the House for her efforts. Whilst the international community is largely focused on the security aspects of the conflict, the scale of the impact within Syria and across its borders has been enormous. As she  when and 700,000 people have fled violence and 2 million Syrians are displaced and 4 million people are in desperate need of  The situation inside is  One quarter of schools and one third of hospitals are not  there are shortages of bread and medicine and critical infrastructure has been destroyed. 2 million people have fled their homes and a living without basic  Clean water, sanitation and electricity.

What the UN estimating the number of refugees to surpass 1 million by June, no end to the suffering is in sight. The success of the conflict conference will provide much in his support for the millions affected by this growing crisis. I welcome the announcement of an additional �71 million of UK aid to Syria. Can she clarified where she expects these resources to be focused? As an knowledge, it isn't just a question of funding but he manager in excess and respect for international law. Donors have repeatedly raised concerns about support reaching all areas. There is limited capacity in both government held and opposition held areas with the front lines constantly shifting.

Thousands of Syrians are arriving in neighbouring countries every day. Yet BT manager in system does not have the capacity to keep up with the growing demands on coordination and children. Only 20% of Serbian refugees are in camps. Can the Secretary of State tell us what steps the department is taking to develop a strategic plan with the went to ensure that the needs of all refugees are being met? This has taken a brutal toll, with and 000 Syrians have been killed. Those who have fled report stories of ongoing violence and human rights violations, including sexual  detention and indiscriminate  According to the International rescue Committee, rape and sexual violence are identified as a primary factor in many Syrians and their decision to  Given this, can the Secretary of State assure the House that UK aid will focus on the protection of Women Against sexual violence?  the crisis will not be resolved until the conflict in Syria is resolved and we must continue to push for a ceasefire. Through international efforts to bring round in the stations, what assessment has a government made of reports of the head of the major opposition coalition said that he was willing to talk to representatives of the government? Can she update the House and what progress has been made an encouraging the National Coalition to accept the Geneva plan as the basis for transition? Can she tell the House what were the objectives and the impact of the reported recent Israeli air strikes in Syria? The brutality of the regime is clear for all to see. But as we see the change in Syria through the ceasefire and political progress, it is important not to forget the here and now suffering of the  That is why I welcome the state and add up the Secretary of State will keep the House informed of developments. I very much appreciate the way in which the Shadow Secretary estate approached his response and it has been a huge ever to cross international community to make sure that the conference was a success and the UK certainly did as much as we could to try to make sure that that  He asked about how the funding will be spent. Of the �50 million at be donated at the conference itself, that will go to sit alongside the UN court made response to the humanitarian crisis. That request of $1.5 billion amount, and about $1 billion goes to have been refugees outside Syria and the rest to help people still suffering  In relation to how to make sure we can reach the many parts of Syria that are difficult  What I can say is that we have to take opportunities and we work through humanitarian partners all the time and they are  impartial but, nevertheless, have the ability to go to parts that are often  Some of them are government controlled and some by the opposition but some are still contested and they are very dangerous places to be in.  we support those humanitarian agencies and went by Tockwith people who head up the World Food Programme, for example, they are clear that they have to take opportunities when they get them so they often find a contact who they trust and they can therefore gain access to new areas and they will take that opportunity. But they often have to be prepared to act quickly and flexibly. We support them in that and the main thing that has been at concern for them in recent weeks has been  Which is why the conference was so important. In terms of what the UK has done correctly within Syria, we have provided medical support, we trained 250 health workers, we have to open about 130 mobile medical units providing care to people and they also provide food and shelter wherever we can. It is important to say that the UN Security Council has been clear in calling for the Syrian and authorities to provide  immediate and free access to all areas in order for humanitarian support to get through. That is absolutely vital and the urge the opposition forces to about access for humanitarian groups. The critical element of being able to use that money effectively is to make sure that we have the routes to get to the people who need  He asked about the strategic response and he is right to flag up that this is a humanitarian crisis that is perhaps different from many of the others that we might do with. Often, we do with natural disasters which take place and then people are acting to tackle the aftermath. This is a humanitarian crisis that has unfolded over many months. And it seems to have ahead of it, a  continuing and unfolding  It might be that we still not have its -- that we still have not seen the worst. Which is why it is vital that President Assad goes  So we can work to rebuild  But we are talking wet the UN agency and other bodies about how we can make sure that they are set up to do with a crisis that could become significantly worse in the coming months if the violence  As I said, there are 2 million internally displaced people within Syria and many refugees I have spoken but where people who had tried their best to stay in  they had moved for the city of Homs to different areas and different places again. They finally got to the terrible situation where they were left with no other option but to leave. You can see that if we have 2 million internally displaced, just a fraction have to leave and become refugees and that would mean a dramatic increase in the humanitarian problems. That is why the conference was so important. We are looking at how we can make sure we are positioned to take care of those people and I should say that I think that for neighbouring countries like Jordan, Lebanon, a ruck and also Turkey, the strain and pressure has been put on them and that is immense and we should bear that in mind when looking at the support we provide. As he quite rightly pointed out, most of the  for example, in Jordan, are not in camps. They are in host  In Jordan and was told the local education system has to 000 children who have arrived with refugee families. So there are significant challenges  And that is why the need to continue to keep the international tension -- attention focused on a very grave situation. He asked about women and girls and he is quite right to raise that. We have been particularly concerned at making sure we can support children. One in five of the people turning up at one such refugee camp was a child aged four years old or under. Nearly 60% of the refugees who have turned up were under 30. We are providing clinical care and counselling to women and children. We hope to divide education to children -- to provide. And support for 1000 it hundred women who we believe are at risk of possibly becoming caused intermarriage and therefore we have provided support to them to make sure that whenever possible that does not happen. And the Foreign Secretary is raising this broader issue a preventing sexual violence in conflict at the international stage and that will be one of the things that we try to push internationally at the G8  He asked about coalition  Like all of the international community, there is a general recommendation that the solution is political. And that will involve talks. Including between the Coalition and the Government but it is very clear that talking with the Coalition, any future transitional government has to have the knowledge that President Assad isn't part of it and we have to have things moving forward with President Assad going so that the rebuilding of Syria can  Finally, he asked about  It is too early to speculate exactly what happened but what we can see is that making sure that we have stability in that region is absolutely critical. It is why at the conference was so important in making sure that in the short term, we have the funding in place to do with the humanitarian crisis but more  we need stability in the region and that will mean a political solution to the challenges in the civil war. Once  in another crisis, we made the terrible mistake of arming rebels in Afghanistan so can the Secretary of State give an absolute commitment that in no way, either directly or indirectly for through  are we giving any aid to Syria that can we used for any offence of purposes, military or to It is underpinning everything that  It has to be humanitarian focused and he is right that we are not in the business of arming to perpetuate this violence.

There is this situation that needs a political solution. Can she tell us whether Russia attended the Kuwait conference and what contributions they are making to the humanitarian and political processes? Russia was at the  What we have pressed for the Russians to do, is to work with us to get a UN Security Council resolution that will start to put in place the building blocks for a political settlement and a political solution to Syria. As he would be aware, that has proved something that is beyond our reach  We hope that a through continued discussions with the Russians and the Chinese, we will be able to make progress. Thus far, the signs have not been positive. I have been able to visit camps for people fleeing Syria in Turkey and Jordan in recent months. Can I endorse what the Secretary of State -- Secretary of State said about the efforts there and the international agencies and the incredible generosity of ordinary people taking Syrian people into their own homes.

No relation to the elements that will help people in Jordan, half of the 1 billion set aside to help refugees will go to those in Jordan. They have been won over 200,000 refugees who have arrived in Jordan. The total population of that country is 6 million. In the context of this committee is a significant influx and it is right that we can do everything to help the Jordanian Government but also UN agencies that are there.

Although we are providing humanitarian support, the UK has not ruled out any action, but we want to press forward on a political and diplomatic route. Can I say that I was at the conference at the weekend with Turkish and Jordanian representatives, both of whom said they thought the international community could do more to help with the refugee problems in their country. Simple things like blankets to keep children warm on needed in the camps now in Jordan and I wondered whether these would be delivered quicker buyers giving directly to the country rather than through the UN? The UN process and logistics are well set-up. The road block that we have had up until now has  The channels of there, people of their, but we cannot scale up support because we haven't had the money in place. The conference will mean that that money is in place now. The basic shelter is one of the key aides that we have brought through to the  It is freezing over there and they need to be protected from the cold. The UN estimates there could be 000 refugees from Syria in Jordan by the end of this year. Can the Secretary of State tell the House how the money provided by this Government will help the condition of children who have had to flee appalling conditions in Syria? If the one of the key things that can now happen is that the camp itself can grow in a more structured way. That does include the establishment of the score and the development of education on that refugee camp for their children who are there. I can provide him with some assurance that there is now a structure plan in place to grow the camp in order to accommodate more refugees as they turn up. That is not just about providing shelter for them, it is about providing other things that they will need such as education for the children but also medical support. I support the preventing sexual violence  Can she assure me that the UK Government is doing all it can to support women and girls affected by the violence, especially those affected by sexual violence? I certainly can. My honourable friend has had a long- term interest in this area of preventing sexual violence against women and girls in conflict. It is right that he is now pushing this whole issue of on the international  We have provided specific support to help make sure there is not just clinical care but also counselling for many of the women and children who have been through horrific experiences as they fled the violence. The honourable lady deserves gratitude for her statement today and for her work in relieving suffering in Syria. Issue concerned about reports that the most merciless slaughter of women and children has been carried out by the group links to Al-Qaeda? As these are part of the opposition, can she say she will do all she can to ensure they don't receive arms, comfort or support from us? I hope I can provide him with that  We have been careful to make sure that when we have been working with humanitarian agencies suffering -- offering support in  that they go through the appropriate channels to make sure they are working with none extremist groups. It has been one of the complex factors that has made delivering support and help with in Syria are even more challenging. The opposition has been quite fragmented in his nature and that has meant that we have had to assess whether they can work with individual groups on a case by case basis. Would my right honourable friend agree with me that having visited the camps, aid is getting through. The big challenge now facing the world community is to get that aid through to Syria itself. Did Russia or China indicate that they would be willing to do that to do get that humanitarian aid into Syria itself? I don't believe Russia was explicit in putting forward any views of around its support for humanitarian aid getting into Syria. We have been clear and the international community has been clear that both the Syrian authorities and the opposition should ensure totally unimpeded access for humanitarian workers in helping those people who are still  There are 4 million of  they are often in areas still  but it has been very challenging to make sure we have coverage across the entire country to stop there are times when we have progress and then due to the progress can have had to pull back. I am speaking in terms of what the humanitarian agencies have achieved. We do need to the International Committee to speak with one voice and urged those in Syria to allow humanitarian support to get through. The numbers at the Secretary of State read out in a statement are truly shocking and I think she has been right both to focus on the need to get aid in but also on building do respect for international humanitarian law, difficult though that second aim is  I would like to ask the Secretary of State what plans her department has to promote the long term that reconstruction of Syria post conflict? He may be aware that earlier this year, we hosted a conference with the Syrian National Coalition to talk about how the political transition might work and some of the challenges that Syria will face once we get beyond the current crisis. It is vital that alongside the humanitarian work there we are engaged in, that we do make sure we put the effort into planning the day after work that needs to go on. That is something we are engaged in doing. Can I ask the Secretary of State whether any assessment is being made of the realms of effective ness of aid provided by different organisations on the ground in this area? We don't want to do anything other than a news agency is that we can  Those that with using are in many cases ages is that have done some fantastic work around the  Bake -- helping them to scale up is our biggest challenge. We will make sure we get the most out of every single pound of money because is vital that we do. What assessment does the Secretary of State have of a number of civilian refugees going into Iraq? How are they being treated in comparison to refugees in Jordan and Turkey? Iraq was a country that had closed its border to refugees and then opened it shortly afterwards. We know there are several 1000 refugees who have fled across the border into  This Government has provided support to those refugees and have provided �2 million to refugees who have fled into Iraq. It is a good example of some of the challenges that we face. Iraq is in a reconstruction phase and here it is having to also cope with additional refugees fleeing from Syria. It is why we should never forget how important it is for the region to make sure those neighbouring countries who are now having to take in refugees are provided with the support they need to be able to The real dangers faced by people trying to get humanitarian aid to people inside Syria, in my experience the on the way that can be done is for some kind of security organisation to be set up on the ground. I totally understand why the mandate from the Security Council is not proper -- possible with the Chinese and Russian  Should we be working  perhaps a gripping from  getting together to provide security for the very brave people trying to get to where other people do not want them to get in Syria? The short answer to that is, that is not what we are anticipating. What we are focused on is making sure humanitarian agencies that we are using to help get support inside Syria, that they,  have unimpeded access to get the support through. That is absolutely clear cut in lot that humanity in workers are allowed  I welcome this international aid on a combined basis to Syria but following on from the good colonel from  can I invite the Secretary of State to address issues within Syria or on the edge  what prospect is there of the establishment of safe havens with the support of Russia and China who so far have not been of assistance? I believe that the prospect of any safe haven is virtually nil because ultimately we do not have a request from the Syrian Government to have any kind of military intervention within  That is at key point which is incredibly important. That country is at civil war and therefore it is extremely unlikely we would be able to assure any kind of safe haven for people that is in any way practically enforceable. What we must do is make sure the humanitarian channels are opened and when people do fleet from Syria and got to neighbouring countries to seek refuge, we provide humanitarian support for them there. He is right we need to consider as many options as we can to provide help to people in their home country of Syria. That is what we are trying to do. There is no doubt that as this crisis unfolds it is very difficult to do that but we  I wonder if you can help in any way, there have been reports of gruesome practices which have not been denied by Metropolitan Police where the names of the children have been used by undercover police officers. It is a matter which I would hope the Home Secretary would come to the House and give an explanation. As I understand it one of the children who died was a boy of four. Another one died in a car crash. Their names and diet emphasise the Metropolitan police have not denied that this practice did take place. I believe this House is due an explanation. Do I find the honourable gentleman for his point  -- I thank the honourable  It is a matter for ministers to decide whether to come to the House to make a statement. The Home Secretary I am sure will be conscious of these matters and she might well feel that the seriousness of them warrants a statement sooner rather than later.

If the honourable lady is dissatisfied with the answer she has received she should drop the matter to the Ascension -- attention of the Procedure Committee. I have considerable sympathy for the honourable lady in so far as she is aggrieved by the tendency of some departments simply to refer members to a website. That is often unavailing and the attention of ministers -- intention of Ministers should be to help members in pursuit of their parliamentary  That ought to be what  It was of great shock this morning to hear for the first time that the cost of maintaining nuclear waste in this country is an astonishing �67.5 billion.

Has there been any approach from a minister, that one or another, to explain how they can spend tens of billions on this? The short answer to the honourable gentleman is that I have received no such indication that a Minister is planning to come to the House to speak about those matters. The honourable gentleman may decide to seek further recourse as he feels he has not done so so far through a point of order. The House is end at very inquisitive mood today! On 16th January I initiated a Westminster Hall debate on the operation of the local Government standards regime. In the course of that debate I and others made reference to the operation of the standard regime in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. On 23rd January there was a meeting of the full council of that London borough and on the same day the chief executive sent a letter which I have sent to your office, Mr  the effect of which I would contend was to attempt to gag any conversation or discussion of what had been discussed in this  I seek your guidance in this  Am I right in thinking the advice given is erroneous in these regards and firstly in using the phrase that the fact that those comments had not been made in Parliament does not entitle councillors to a fair or repeat them in council or elsewhere.

Secondly, the reference to making such a report might be in breach of the member Office of code of the council is in error in that an internal code of a council cannot override the right of qualified privilege in relation to a report on this House if other necessary qualifications are met. Thirdly, that the attempt by a public body to gag discussion or criticism of that body raised in this House is at the very least a discourtesy to decisive not verging on the  Thank you. With the reference to the use of material outside of the House being bona fide gay or not I would say that is a normal course. -- bona-fide or  I am quite clear that the honourable member's contribution in Westminster Hall is protected entirely by its Article 9 of the Bill of Rights. What he said on that occasion might not be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.

It would be wrong to offer any opinion on that question from the chair. He might want to take up any questions with the joint committee on parliamentary privilege. One of the reasons I admire you so much is because you are such a defender of the rights of this House. You recall last week that I raised with you the fact that the same six marriage Bill will not apparently be committed to the House tomorrow. I'll talk I can put down a motion Mike self to commit to the whole house and I have done so, apparently it cannot be debated. Even if a majority, all the members of parliament had and motioned the only people who can commit a bill to the House at the Government. Is there not something wrong with our procedures by which, when you are faced with an important bill which has constitutional issues concerning the established Church, nobody but the Government has a right to do that? I thank the  What he has said to the House is substantially correct and that is because the motion put forward by the Government takes  My understanding is that once the Government has tabled a motion on the matter which the honourable gentleman has in mind, it is not possible for another motion to be considered before or alongside it. The matter in question is catered for, albeit very and satisfactorily in the mind of the honourable gentleman, by the borders of the House. If he or others would like such standing orders to be revisited or revised, one possible course would be to approach the Procedure Committee and ask whether it would be considered possible to do so. However that does not avail the honourable gentleman tomorrow and he might wish to pursue the point that so far as tomorrow's debate is  I know he has not raced this with regard to himself, a large number of honourable and right honourable members will be seeking to catch my eye.

I turn now to the third element in the Bill, the draft decision to maintain the number of EU commissioners at the equivalent of one per member state. The proposed a reduction in the commission and its subsequent loss of the guaranteed Commissioner emerged as a concern during the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. In order to secure it, it was agreed the decision will be taken to maintain the number of EU commissioners before the appointment of the next commission  The European Council has put forward this draft decision in order to fulfil the commitment made to Ireland. This come it is committed to creating a less you Priya critic European Union and improving efficiency in the EU  -- this bureaucratic European Union.

In the Lisbon Treaty, it stays there will be one commissioner per member state until the 1st November  The number of commissioners will be reduced to a number corresponding to two-thirds of member states. That concession was made during the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. The concession was that each member state would continue to have one commissioner. To enable this commitment to come into effect, it is necessary to have the conclusion of the European Council agreed by this Parliament. The three draft decisions are the first decisions to be brought before this House and the European Union Act 2011. I would like to make a few remarks about that  First of all, can I say that we welcome the fact that the agreement of Parliament is being sought on these decisions. During the passage of a Bill, although we had reservations about the possibility of referendums being held on a multiplicity of small issues, we supported referendums being held on issues of constitutional significance and we supported a bigger role for  both in terms of the European legislation but also in terms of actual decision-making. This is why we did not oppose the European Union bill and did not divide the House. In the constitutional sense, decisions are  Some decisions were made a European level.

The Government has changed its mind after the European scrutiny committee and its indomitable cheer pointed out the error of the year ways. I would like to make belief comment on each  Firstly on the official journal of the EU. The EU has of course produced the OJ in printed form which has been available in printed form since 1988. It contains information about the treaties and judgments of the European Court of Justice. Crucially it also provides invitations for contracts. It is a crucial part of the mechanism which enables the single market to function and develops. As we all  the single European market is vital to our economy. They will also need to take into account a relatively recent court ruling to ensure that online versions of the Official Journal have parity with paper versions. I would like to refer members to a particular case regarding a company in the Czech  After being fined for infringing Customs legislation,  which operated in the imports sector brought an action for the cancellation of that fine before the European Court.

After the discussions and which took  Obviously the Deputy Speaker has not tried that delicacy! After the European tour it was referred to the European Court of Justice. There were questions over whether this would allow the provision of the Community regulation on something that had not been published in the journal. The court went on to State that proper publication does not equate with publication on the internet. It is precisely this point by the clarification within this legislation is being given. The case which has concern about digitalisation is important. The second draft decision relates to D  The previous framework for it expired at the end of last year.

The third decision relates to the number of EU commissioners. Perhaps this is the most significant of the proposals in the Bill.

I have already issued my press release. I am speaking to a packed chamber. I shall be fine. I thought it might be wise to explain why it is important for these matters to be discussed today. The European Union at 2011 which has brought forward today's debate, might look as though some are of no consequence and do not need to be talked about.  as the gentleman who opened for the Government and the honourable gentleman who open for the opposition said, he's an important matters. Other member states find them amazingly  The German federal constitution court talked about an article of the union, the flexibility clause which has caused so much excitement on the -- in the past on which proposals are made. When Germany was seeking to ratified the Lisbon Treaty, specifically the question was whether this treaty article which gives the European Union sweeping legislative power was compatible with democracy as enshrined in  The court had already found that for them to have legitimacy the EU had to have a democratic decision in a Germany's parliament. It was said that article 352 not formally establishes a Conteh pence the -- competence in article, the principle which must be conferred on the EU member states by the European Union is set out to be possible if the treaties have not provided specific competence  They must serve to create a competence which makes action at the European level  The German court ruled that as regards the power transferring powers, this provision should meet with constitutional objections because the newly worded provision makes it possible to substantially amend treaty foundations without the mandate to the participation of bodies with member state's powers. Essentially it said the German parliament would have to examine these matters as well and I think it is good we are at least making deep German  albeit a few years  We are here to discuss these relatively important issues as the European Parliament has done. You could argue that the public are or less Eurosceptic in Germany because their parliament talks about these things on a regular basis so they can have understanding. I am very concerned that we are speaking about these matters and that it would make people more pro-European. I want to encourage Euro-scepticism so maybe we should talk about them There are some facts in front of us and this is a very good for them on which to discuss these  It has been put forward by the excellent European Union Act of  Under the European Union Act there was a final agreement in the council or European Council with a proposal on the basis of the EU treaties being used in these cases. The proposed decisions must be made by an Act of Parliament, of what we are doing here today. The present EU flexibility clause which means some proposals are exempt from the approving Acts of Parliament. I am happy to go into those exemptions should honourable members want to know what they are. One member is obviously very keen to discuss these over a beer afterwards! The UK -- without the UK support these cannot be affected. That covers all member states. Our members have already listed what these proposals would achieve. The EU regulation for the Official Journal to take the UWE legal affect rather than the printed version. The EU decision that sets out a broad areas of work for the rights agency and the decision on the number of European Commissioners. While the first two proposals may seem to be of huge importance, they are based on this flexibility clause which does give the EU sweeping powers to adopt clauses where treaties have not otherwise given the EU power to  It has been used to adopt significant measures in the past such as the bail-out fund for non eurozone member states.

I wanted to make the point in relation to the Official Journal and how difficult it is to bring that Jennelle -- Journal in written and electronic form. The Government has an agreement to the proposed regulation and the council is ready to adopt this proposal. The European Parliament has given its consent. Then there is the second part of this, the proposed decision to establish a multi- annual work programme for the EU fundamental rights agency. One can make a parting shot about the growth in the number of these agencies at EU level. There are a huge amount of them now and it seems to be a that one has to go to each member state. In 2007, the you -- the EU adopted a regulation based on their clause that established the agency for fundamental rights in Vienna. It was at lined by the honourable The agency's activities include  analysing information and publishing reports and developing a communications strategy and a dialogue with civil society it in order to raise public awareness of such fundamental  In 2013, the agency will get a subsidy of 21.3 million euros from the EU budget. Half of which will be spent on staffing the stock according to Article 5 of the agency's found in regulation, the chasm is to adopt a five-year annual frameworks that set out areas of the activity over the relevant period. This must include the fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance. In addition to the framework, the agency can respond to requests from  European Parliament or European Commission to conduct studies will produce conclusions on particular topics. The decision before Parliament now is the proposed multi- and your framework. -- multi- annual framework. Under this decision, the areas of work would be access to justice, victims of crime including compensation of victims of crime, respect for private life and protection of personal data, judicial Corporation except in criminal matters, divides of the child's, discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, membership of a national minority property, birth, sexual orientation, immigration and integration of migrants, Visa and border control and Asylum and  xenophobia and related intolerance. The Government has given political, not legally binding agreements to the decision  The council is ready to adopt this proposal and the European Parliament has already given its consent. This leaves us with the final measure which is probably more controversial than the original speech.

In the change introduced, after great discussion in the European Parliament and debates in member states parliaments, it was decided that from 20th November 14, the European commissioners would be two-thirds the number of member  -- 20th November 14. It was also to maintain some easier management of the bureaucracy from  The members states whose nationals will be commissioned would be decided on the basis of a system of the core rotation between member states, reflecting the Democratic and geographical range of all the member states.

Without Irish ratification, bad treaty could not enter into force and as a  the EU heads of state offered concessions to Ireland. One of the main ones offered -- said the decision would be taken to the effect that the commission should continue to include one national of each member state. Those concessions seemed enough for the Irish people and they voted for the second referendum in 2009. They proved that treaty. The draft European Council decision has now been brought forward, which would provide that from November 2014  The draft decision says it would be reviewed in advance of the appointment of the commission due to take office in 2090.

It is highly unlikely this change will ever be  We will continue to be built in the number of European Commissioners. Does this mean that for every European Commissioner, there has to be built a Department to support the commissioner or are they going to be Commissioners without portfolio, as such? I will address that point in a moment. There is no commissioner in charge of paperclips. Every Commission has to have a group of people around  They bring with them the extra language and there is a huge amount of cost and bureaucracy associated with that.

I wonder if some proposals to trim the commission in total budget for the next seven years could not have been achieved even if it was not possible to trim or cap the future number of commissioners, had there been a reasonable debate on this  I conclude when I began. It is really good to see some proper scrutiny, for it from the EU act of 2011 and I think the Government for bringing forward that piece of legislation and then sticking to both the letter and the  I shall apologise for not having been here for the front bench speeches early on.

Britain must have commissions for the foreseeable future. Not just the interests as they see it rather than the abuse. We also get appropriate portfolios to those who should have them. It is great to see the European Union Act of 2011 in practice and inaction. It has certainly drawn in the crowds today in a way that we perhaps that worried might not. It was something that during the passage of the EU act we were warned that this might get a disproportionate response. The fact that we have ended up spending parliamentary time on the floor of the chamber discussing the publication in electronic format of the European Parliamentary record does suggest we might have had a  We remember ministers assuming this might persuade some of the attitude to Europe.

The third measure is the one that is perhaps worth more substantial debate. It is the adjustment of the mechanism that we are supposed to limit the size of the Commission and the growth of the commission. It was not simply the practicality of an ever increasing number of commissioners. There is, without being unkind to some smaller member  a capacity issue in terms of being able to produce candidates of sufficient calibre or for something that affects the entire  It does slightly, in terms of public perception, muddy the whole idea of the commission. The commission should be the equivalent of our Civil Service, the servant of the councils, of ministers and the parliament. It should not really be presenting -- pretending to be a representative body in the same way. That is a sentiment I will agree with the. It acts like a Government rather than as a full service. I was told even this week by someone who knows that when commission officials decide something it generally happens. I do not often agree with the honourable gentleman on matters European but I think it is something we have all been aware of over many decades, we have to be careful about democratic accountability in the European  I would always support that where we can increase it. There are issues with the potential for the endless growth of EU commissioners, limited only by the size of the number of European states that might join the European Union. It is clear from the Irish referendum debate and any fan of the European TV series boredom will know, that for smaller countries it is something they attach a great deal of importance. We are a community of many nations with many different priorities and it is important that we acknowledge that. I certainly support the Government in backing this measure. There was a brave effort by the honourable member for Daventry to try to make this sound contentious. Certainly in the spirit of Coalition unity I would recognise that the European Union at 2011 has brought a greater level of accountability and scrutiny to legislation in this place. That is a process that could go further. At the beginning of last year ministers announced there would be a review of the scrutiny of European legislation. I found myself in even more agreement with the honourable Member for Stone in suggesting committees automatically and routinely they ate it European legislation that was relevant to their particular beliefs. I will ask members to update us on the progress of that process and ask how far on we are? In the interest of the parliamentarians I would say that the procedures of select committees are very much not for the Government to decide, but for this House. It is the recommendations of the Government that are at scrutiny rather than the issue in contention. Many of us did make submissions on that basis.  I think that kind of scrutiny might be better, or a greater use of statutory committees, to scrutinise legislation of this  While I absolutely stunned by the European Union Act which was an important agreement between the Conservative and Lib Dem wings of the Coalition, for a while many Euro-sceptic members of the Conservative backbenches thought we would give greater scrutiny to  I would in time wonder whether it is a better use of parliamentary time to spend time in the main chamber dealing with issues that are relatively uncontentious and in many cases relatively unimportant in the greater scheme of things. I am happy to give my support to this today with that major caveat. It is a pleasure as always to follow on my honourable friend with whom I disagree in almost every matter in  I think it is fascinating we are spending parliamentary time scrutinising what is being done in the European Union. So many laws come through our nation from the European Union practically rubber-  The percentage we sent through for debate in committee is  That which comes to the floor of the House, smaller still. It allows the European Union very widespread power to extend its abilities to legislate across it's areas of competence. That must be something that it is important for us to scrutinise and control. Of course it is an honour to give way. Could he remind us how many of his constituents have contacted him with their concerns about the European Parliament? I am bombarded with messages from across the  probably internationally from people who want to know that the laws that are made that affect them are made clearly so that the know what they are and that they are not caught out by trickery and underhand practices. That is a fundamental principle of why they sent me here.

I put it to my honourable friend that it is pretty important the number of commissioners that are appointed. The number of commissioners has a direct spin off on cost. There are two parts to that. The first I'd disagree with. The form in which instructions are sent out is  It is right that people should know that it is a long- standing principle of our lot that ignorance of the law is no excuse. If it is feared that ignorance of the law is no excuse it is also fear that the law should be made available to people in a time efficient way. It is something which should be debated by this chamber and passed into law. That park I disagree with but on the second part I am in complete agreement. The issue of commissioners is significant. The second point that I raised to my right honourable friend, the  is also crucially important because of the reference that I raised with him of the change from article 308 of the previous treaties to be more modern one that the new 35 2 o'clock was his broader and the chef, had it been allowed, had it been assume that anything that had been incorporated could be transmitted, it could have allowed all sorts of  My honourable friend from Daventry went through a number of  allowed them to pass in through the body of European powers without any further scrutiny by  As is often this case, something which is in itself minor has set an important precedents in protecting the rights of this House to scrutinise and insure the rights of our constituents are protected. I do briefly wished to discuss the issue of the number of commissioners. I do not have the confidence that some honourable members have in our commissioners. I do not feel happy that we have one representing us because when they go to the European Union they say they will act in the best interests of the European Union. Some will argue this is contrary to the off they have taken as Privy  While they are beer, the hour by designed there to represent the interests of Europe,  Perhaps because of our history and traditions, I think when our commissioners gaudier they tend to take that very seriously. Commissioners from some other countries may simply go there and represent the nation State who has  I do not have this great confidence that the person representing the UK is waving a  That person might well be waving a flag.Thank you for  I am one of those who has been concerned about Commissioners for many years. I think they do not really represent, if there is at collective view  they do not represent  One possibility is they should  We have started to elect police commissioners, why not They can appear to fit in with the ethos of the European Union. I want to come back to Ireland and the specifics of what they got given to persuade them. What that showers -- what that shows his country's can renegotiate with the European Union for things that they feel that they need when things are being discussed in the European councils. That is an important point. We have often heard people say that the Prime Minister can go to Europe and they would give him anything. You have to like it or lump it.  the European Union is a fundamentally pragmatic body and the way it gets agreement amongst member states. It does a lot of hearse trading -- horse trading one way or another. The lady sings to be nodding vaguely at this point. That means that when we go there  if you want X, you must  you must give us to Z in return it, that is a strong position for us to be in when the requirement is for unanimity. What Ireland has done is very important and very encouraging for the United Kingdom and for the position of the Prime Minister in negotiations. I want to finish with praise for the Government on this bill and the consequence of the 2011 Bill which has brought it forward. When that Bill was going through, it wasn't welcomed universally, but even people on my own side were sceptical about the effect of that it would have. I was pleased to see it member for Caerphilly Wakelin me  But the mood has changed his  -- welcoming it. It really shows that the 2011 Act is working and is acting as a proper check on what goes on in the European Union. Without that Act, none of the three things in front of us today would have required legislation. Because  they all do and because of  something very important and crucial has come for this chamber. It could have been very controversial. I feel we are secure  thanks to the Government, and having a better check in powers to  I might like to reverse them but at least now we are checking them. I would like to refer to the question of the referendum being announced. We have heard much of the two pairs and 11  I am opposed it in many of its  I felt that although it had a so called referendum lock, in  it wasn't going to deal with the kind of things which we are now being besieged by, including the question of those measures which are introduced into the political core of Europe, the  which affects the UK but merely because it refers to the UK. They did not require a referendum however significant the impact is  The European Scrutiny Committee made a report on that question to stop we remain extremely concerned about the effect of allowing legislation to go through without referendum. There isn't a transfer of powers to stop this is not just about a transfer of power. A referendum is required where there is a fundamental change. Interestingly, the fact that the referendum, which the Prime Minister has announced, is a very good and perfect example of something that does not fall within the European Union at 2011.  he is indicating that it would require a referendum on the grounds that it will have such an impact, the proposals which are about to be announced for which he thinks will be likely to announce, and what has already been transferred, on the bed of the treaties and the question of the impact on the United Kingdom in relation to the whole question of what the past and existing treaties have already provided for, is going to be a requiring a referendum. It has an effect through the existing treaties which have had such an unfortunate effect on the United Kingdom in aggregate. He is extremely kind as ever. Would he tell the House whether he would like a referendum on the bill that we are considering today? I didn't  I said the referendum that the Prime Minister announced goes outside of the provisions of the 2011 Act and demonstrates the fact that weather is fundamental  the Prime Minister recognises that this is a requirement, albeit it is not taking place as early as some of us  Would he recognise that the EU act of 2011 was to stop powers being sucked away from the UK going to the European Union at their request? What the Prime Minister's referendum is about is about any settlement that may require pow was returning from the European Union. That is true. I still maintain that the key question is whether or not the requirements which are contained in the five principles which include repatriation, which includes the primacy of natural parliaments on which the European scrutiny committee has in deed insisted on, because of the implications in relation to economic governments, are all part of parcel of what has been going wrong in the European  I welcome the idea of a referendum but with a caveat that I don't think that the timing is  That is a separate question. Turning to this question of what cool 352 of the treaty for the function of the European Union, my honourable friend made an excellent speech and the Member for Somerset  not to mention the honourable gentleman, the Member  All of whom are mid European Scrutiny Committee and are very familiar with the intricacies of these arguments.

For those who have been around for as long as I have on this issue and have -- and I have served it with his seven years on the European Scrutiny .. Not long enough, says my honourable friend. The fact is that bought call 308 is a very contentious issue and is reflected in provisions in our own domestic  which are all about the question of whether or not, when you pass an enactment, you can do all such things as regarded as necessary without further primary legislation. It so happens that art-school 352 has similar words in that it says, if action by the union should prove necessary within the framework of the Policies defined in the treaties to retain one of the objectives set out in the treaties and the treaties are not providing the powers, then acting unanimously and with the consent of the European Parliament, they should adopt the measures. What that means is they -- there is an amber light coming up in relation to the acquisition. There is no actual legal base for them. That is the key question. That is the reason for this bill. Neither of the sections in the two dozen 11 Act -- 2011 Act, actually require and apply to the draft decisions made under articles 352. That is why an Act of Parliament is  It is a safeguard. It is very important that we have an act of parliament, despite what the honourable member for Cheltenham  Not specifically because of the nature of the provision in  but because the act of  which he was so keen to  didn't provide full circumstances of this kind. I will certainly give way because I'd like to hear the kind of contrary view. I am tempted to ask him to content -- to comment on the on board member's comments for Daventry. I think he may be misquoting me. I didn't say we should have legislation relating to this, as suggested it needn't be primary legislation in every case. I don't really want it to be drawn down along that route for the simple reason that the reason for primary legislation is there would be no legislative authority of adequate  to deal with the questions that arise even under this Bill, albeit with the exception of the two matters I will raise. They require consideration by the European Scrutiny Committee which are one now turn to. With respect to this question of the multi- and will framework for the European Agency for fundamental rights, the position is that it was originally  I want to give a tiny bit of history to this. The Justice Minister said in a memorandum issued to the House in January 2012, that he thought this was justified.  he went on to say that the Government would have opposed the proposal to extend the multi- annual framework, but would consider whether the technical issues that it happened to dislike, had been addressed. The European Scrutiny Committee reported on the proposal on the 1st February 2012 and we are asked the Government whether it accepted the European Commission view that with the entry into the force of the Lisbon Treaty, the agency's remit extends in principle to all areas of competence and the agency and it may undertake activities within the field of police and judicial co- operation without any further amendment to its founding regulation. We question the Government's view that this decision satisfied the exemption requirements under the section 8 of the 2011 Act and would not require an Act of Parliament. Our 10th report set out our concerns in greater detail. That draft decision remained under scrutiny. Before the Lord Chancellor, now the Minister for Rushcliffe, told the Scrutiny Committee in that month that a political agreement has been reached on the draft decision which excluded any new activity covering EU policing and criminal law  In a letter that he sent on 22nd November, the Government told the European at Scrutiny Committee that it was now, having heard what we said, of the opinion that the exemption did not apply in this case and that primary legislation will be brought forward. That is why this bill is here. The European Scrutiny Committee did his  We asked for further clarification. Sometimes people wonder what all the detail is about and whether you have to be as intricate as this. By pointing out the legal objectives we were raising and having a dialogue with the Government about this, who in turn had dialogue with the European  we helped make the legislation that much better and to ensure there was primary legislation so that in the absence of the authorisation deemed to be appropriate through the 2011 Act, which guarantees that this House had an opportunity to consider it in the way it is today. There will be a committee stage and a report  We reported again on the proposal on 20th November. We did clear the document but in January  we pointed out to the We have respect to the draft condition by, there is again at example of the European scrutiny commission taking its role for route to the Government and thereby to decommission. The position on that one is this.

It is open to any member of Parliament because it is open to the House to oppose it or examine it in committee. Just one moment defy me. The problem that we have is that when we provide for amendments in relation to matters which have already been through the Council of Ministers, under section  we are under an obligation to continue to pass that legislation through our Parliament which raises the very questions the Prime Minister has raised in his speech regarding the role of national  The European scrutiny committee is at this moment conducted an inquiry into scrutiny and these are some of the matters we are considering.

If we wanted to vote against it raises the very question that is embedded in the white paper of 1971 which led to the passing of the Act in 1972, including sections two and 3, one of which is that we implement all decisions irrespective once they have been decided by the Council of  Secondly we must agree to all decisions of the European  I see this if I may, we have  in the context of the Prime Minister's speech, not just in respect of the referendum, nonetheless, that we have to evaluate where the actual power of the passing legislation really lies because we need an Act of  For the reasons already given and I endorsed and explained, but if we do not want these provisions to go through, can we be taught as a Parliament? The reality is that we should be allowed to do so and that will become part of the European scrutiny inquiry that we are now conducting. It is very difficult to justify, I would say, to the British people. If they vote in the General Election to have certain legislation picked through and then they find it is decided in the Council of Ministers where every boat goes in favour of European proposals then the whole business of about things are decided in relation to that legislation is a vitally important question that affects the daily lives of the voters in this country. I will certainly give way. I am  May I congratulate him for his committee bringing this before the House. How can it be right that a small country like Luxembourg is equally represented on decommission compared to a complex country such as ourselves. It makes no sense whatsoever.  paragraph 2 seems to indicate that however many countries join the EU will still get commissioners, we could end up with 30 or more at commissioners, how can that be? I am reminded of what Alice said in Alice in  it was, I think half a dozen impossible things before breakfast every day. I think this is possibly one of the examples. The reality is that there are 27 member states. There was a lot of discussion about whether there should be an equivalent number of commissioners. It was decided that each one would continue to have a commissioner. I understand what my honourable friend is saying and it is difficult to justify in terms of  geography, population, GDP  On the other hand, if they were to be done at -- to be denied some would say it is unfair because they are excluded. I have argued in the past that the European Commission should be relegated to the role of secretary at and not to have the role it currently enjoys. My honourable friend has most eloquently and that some length posed the question that I was going to ask and answered it which was effectively whatever we  it will have no impact on the number of commissioners.That is actually correct given the fact that we have got this problem of the Beetle which was promised to us being taken away. -- veto. The functions of the European Union were fairly restricted initially and up until including the single European acting in 1986 which I bought it for, there were a limited number of qualified boating  At that time I put down an amendment that said nothing in this that should detract from the United Kingdom Parliament. I was then advised by the clerks of the House and I went to the Speaker  I was told that it was not possible to move such an amendment because if I did so I was challenging the actual fabric of the 1972 Act itself. Time has moved  Off in terms of respect of the number of values being now brought in and also in respect of the qualification which I deeply deplore that was contained in the 1971 white paper. That led by Amelia six votes to the passing of  -- by at mayor six votes.  We could undermine, endanger the very fabric of the European Community itself. I repeated that the other day and will do so again because on the basis of which this mass of legislation which includes all the treaties since the referendum which took place in 1975, the 45 million people in this country who have never had an opportunity to express their view which, I have said several times a day, treaty after  without a referendum, yet there is a vast accumulation of majority vote with all the passing of the legislation. In respect of this one provision in this Bill, there are matters which would normally require an bill which went through both Houses of Parliament, as this one will, when so much of the rest simply goes through even though it may be based on just a  There is a complete mismatch in proportionality on the matter in which we legislate. I will simply conclude by saying there may be no division this evening but that does not alter the fact that we have done our job in the European scrutiny Committee and in this House in examining something under article 352 that otherwise would not have had a  It is a very dangerous thing to legislate when you do not have the power to do so. The rule of law is essential to the running of as stable Government and a stable European Union as well. If there was to be a European Union it had better be stable and in accordance with the rule of law. Increasingly the European Union is demonstrating its lack of regard for the rule of law. When 25 member states went ahead it was unlawful. There are many other examples as  When there is a decision and something is in breach of its own rule like the European Union, then there is trouble ahead. Mr Deputy  it is a pleasure to follow my honourable friend who does such as Sterling service to this House in his capacity to be European scrutiny committee. Can I pay tribute to all those members do the European scrutiny committee who have not only ensured we have the opportunity of holding the Government to account and the European Union to account in tonight's debate but also on issues in the future. Can I do find -- confine my remarks to the fundamental rights agency? You will remember that when de Lisbon Treaty was being discussed our Government said they were against the fundamental rights agency because they thought it was completely superfluous and unnecessary. All it would do would duplicate the work of the Council of Europe. Indeed, that is exactly what it has set out there to do. You have set the Council of Europe to duplicate the work of the Council of Europe. What it means to me is that with this new hardball that we are playing in Europe that we are not taking on  We should be seeing why are you expanding your activity, why have you got a substantially increased budget? -- saying. The fundamental rights agency budget has risen to 21.3 million euros per  Only a few years ago it was hardly 100 euros. It was a very small minuscule budget. Under that budget it is being wasted. I am going to give you an example of one It was taken up with guests of the fundamental rights agency who are inquiring of them. They come from all over Europe and beyond Europe in order to discuss issues relating to a fundamental rights issue. This seems to me that this was an unnecessarily extravagant and it is after all the role of the fundamental rights agency. Their role is to provide advice. It is not to give jollies to people who are from NGO's. When I read the research paper from House of Commons and saw some of the background to how all the commission reached the conclusion  I am dubious about it. Is said that on 13th December, the Commission proposed a framework and it can sort of the management board of the fundamental rights agency. He consulted and received a contribution. The management board consulted the agents -- agencies fundamental rights platform, Annett work with civil society. I suspect most of the people present in that hotel where members of the agency's fundamental rights platform. A  because they are used to getting a this indulgence at the taxpayers' expense, they were in favour of the expansion of the fundamental rights agency, as set out in this revised multi- annual  What an extraordinary state of affairs. I am surprised that our Government hasn't played a harder ball on this issue. I'm sure we will have the chance to focus on this by moving an amendment when we get to discussing it in committee  The European Parliament, when commenting on the results of the consultation, said 108 organisations took part in the consultation and most support the work and would like to continue, particularly in various areas including asylum and migration. A lot of support for extending the work of the fundamental rights  Can I suggest that it would be better that if we have to have  a fitted stopped duplicating the Council of Europe  -- if it is stopped. The Council of Europe budget is not going up because the European Union members of the Council of Europe say they can't afford to spend more money on the Council of Europe. Well the costs of the European Court of Human Rights continue to  it means the European budget is being squeezed in all  including in the areas of research. Meanwhile, the research is now increasingly being done by the fundamental rights agency with money that should rightly be contributed to the Council of Europe instead. I am disappointed that the Government seems to be going along with this expansion of the fundamental rights  Does it fit in with our policy of her this Parliament of trying to reduce the size of the European Union budget? A challenge to put out to those of us who want to have a real-terms reduction in the Budget is, what are you going to cut? Wallaby the expenditure on the fundamental rights agency. -- one would-be. If we hadn't agreed to the expansion of that framework and they insisted on its being reduced in scope, we would be able to secure our real saving sense that would be a contribution to the general reduction in the European Union budget which everybody on the side of the House wishes to see. Can I mention one of the thing? -- one other thing. May I praise my honourable friend for his work in establishing what the budget of this new organisation is. Can I suggest that as his cast of Europe is giving the European taxpayer such good value for money and having this Budget reduced each  instead of having his agency, that all of its functions be given to the Council of Europe and we could reduce the European budget? I think that is a brilliant idea and I thought for a long time that that was the policy that was supported by a whole Government. Indeed it is the policy that is supported by almost every member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, including a lot of members to come from called European Union states. They regard themselves as being Europhiles in  Even Des are saying, what is the point of duplicating the functions of of the Council of Europe? -- even if they are saying. I hope he could take their its idea further forward. If we are going to have a fundamental rights agency and we are going to have a multi- annual framework for it, then why don't we concentrate on one or two areas where there is an obvious need for further work to be done? At the moment, it talks about the thematic areas including emigration and integration of migrants. --  That is an area where the European Union is fundamentally failing and at the moment. There were before last I was in Greece and visited the Greece/Turkey border and had briefings from the Greek Government, Greek ministers and the coastguard about the problem of illegal migrants coming  mainly from Turkey. One of the problems they have increased which contributes to the  xenophobia and related intolerance referred to in item J of the areas, is that it is important and impossible for Greece to return the illegal migrants to the countries from which they came. I can give the House one example that when visiting a detention centre in Athens, I went up to this wire fence and asked whether there was anybody there who spoke English. Cut a long story short, I started in conversation with a person who said that he had arrived in that detention centre because he had set out from Afghanistan, he had paid 000 to smugglers to get him across Iran and then Turkey and what he wanted to do then was to go from Turkey across the GNC and on to be Italian eastern seaboard. He could then make his way up to the  I inquired about all this and  why did he won't go to London? He said he wanted to go there because he had been in there for five years up until a few months ago and that he had got lots of friends here in London and they had paid for him to go this $8,000 for his return trip. What had happened was he had been deported from the UK after playing our system for five years and within a few weeks of getting back to Afghanistan, this wholly undeserving case was now presenting himself at this Greek detention  Unfortunately for him, the vote he was on from Turkey had founded and was fortunate that the Greek coastguard rescues him and he wasn't drowned. He found himself in this detention centre but the Greek  they have no way of returning this person back to Afghanistan. Afghanistan do not accept that anybody who is in Greece emanated a richly from  What happens is even if that person is detained in Greece for the maximum of 18 months, he will then be released and will join all those other people in Greece or Italy who do not belong  who don't wish to stay there, but then contribute to the feelings of racism and xenophobia on the part of the indigenous population. 60% of the people in prison increase at the moment on on Greek  What I am saying is that if there is a need for the fundamental rights agency, it should be looking at this issue rather than messing around with some of the other expanded areas which we have referred to. If the fundamental rights agency started looking at the issue of the Geneva Convention and the inability of asylum-seekers to be able to claim asylum in Turkey because of the way in which Turkey has opted out of many of the provisions of the Geneva Convention, then that might help focus attention on the need to strengthen the Turkish EU border. I  A Issie conscious of the fact that in the explore edgy memorandum, that the Justice Minister gave his example of a useful tool in measuring the impact of European legislation on fundamental right across Europe? He cited an example of legal analysis in no position for gay, lesbian... Was he aware of the fact that that was the criteria that was chosen by the Justice Minister? I wasn't aware of that. I am grateful for my honourable friend pointing that out. As we often say, it is an issue of priorities and people must be judged as the priority that they give to different issues. This seems to me that in the light of the crisis that we have got in Europe at the moment on the European borders, it is rather odd that that should be the subject of priority as against be issued to which I have been referring.  this debate could give us an opportunity to going to discussing a lot more about asylum and border control. I am not going  I highlighted where I think this is an important issue and I think it would be better if this organisation got on with dealing with the serious issues rather than trying to expand its remit the whole time. Could he say something about to whom this fundamental human rights body would be accountable? Who will set their agenda in future? Who will control its budget? Normally you will address the chair? This is not a private conversation. This is a debate and we have drifted a little  Apologies. Because we are sitting so close, it seems as though it is a private conversation. You can always continue it in the  I am sure that is not the  I shall raise my voice so it is obvious it is not a private conversation and Mike Rumble friend would like to have this conversation on the record. If he was in the tea room, it wouldn't be on the record. The short answer to his question is that this is a great opportunity now. It is only every five years that the fundamental rights agency has his multi- annual framework approved and if we approve a multi- and all framework which we think has the wrong priorities, then this is the moment to make sure we change that. This Bill could be amended to reflect the concerns of this I am talking to you! It seems that would be impossible. What we see here would have little impact on the final decision. I hope that is  I think my friend is demonstrating some pessimistic realism about this or pessimism. I would like to assure him 100% that if this House in its sovereign right decides to even repeal the European Community Act in 1972, which we entered into in a voluntary basis in that here, or any other sections. We are entitled to do so in this House and there is nothing anybody can stop us from doing it except those which we will  I am not going to go back  Obviously we have a bit of time but I do not want to go to the complete end. As you know, just because time is available does not mean we have to use it. Certainly, I think there are other honourable members who may wish to participate or who may regret they missed the opportunity to participate in this  when they look at the  Some of us may wish to catch the eye of the Speaker tomorrow as well. I think this is am very worthwhile the beat. It is fantastic that we have got the opportunity to discuss this Bill. I disagree with the Member for Cheltenham about the fact that the relatively low attendance for this debate shows a lack of interest. It does not show that whatsoever. It shows that a lot of people who looked at it are now discussing it and will look forward to seeing what the response is. Obviously most of the decades from now on, for the next several years, on the issue of Europe, will be preparatory to that great  I would like to see the Government start work now on drawing up an audit of the costs and benefits of our membership. Perhaps in the context of this particular bill they could do a lot worse than draw up an audit of the benefits of the work of the fundamental rights agency. Some markets been duplicated. I am not voting against this bell but I am glad that in due course we'll have the opportunity to discuss some amendments to it. It has been a wide-ranging debate on the second reading of the European Union approvals bill. Two of the three measures we have considered today are fairly uncontroversial. The right honourable member for Ashford,  said these changes are not far reaching and are largely  However, as has been pointed out, one third proposal regarding the number of European Commissioners is more or controversial and significant. I will come to that in due course. Let me first turn to the online version of the Official Journal of the European Union. Not withstanding the arrangements put in place for an electronic signature to be added to the online version to ensure authenticity, I would have thought this has come quite late in the day. Given that we're in the 21st century. There are also now 27 member states of the European Union. As the right honourable member for Ashford reminded as earlier, that is increasing on a daily basis. You might have thought an online legal version might have come much  The House might have welcomed this decision. We are sure it will facilitate a more or efficient and economic legal publication. Given the climate change legislation and the targets we have signed up to, we hope this will go some way to contributing to reaching those targets, given that we will not see so many paper versions of the Official Journal.  the draft framework for the EU fundamental rights the agency from 2013 until 2017, will be sought again. It is a sensible way forward. The honourable gentleman, the Member for Christchurch, said that he did not think that the issues drawn out by the Justice Minister, who I tend to  he said the agency provides a useful tool in measuring EU legislation and fundamental rights across Europe. This is not a role that is taken on by the Council of Europe. It is not work that is required by the Council of  Also, the example that was cited by the honourable member for stone of the apparent legal analysis of the, lesbian and transsexual people across the EU states which has been worked on I think is actually a very serious issue and a very useful report. I am not in agreement with the honourable member for store, nor the honourable member for Christchurch. I know how familiar she is with the Council of Europe and the General Assembly but the Council of Europe comprises 47 different countries saw the applicant states for the membership of the European Union are members of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe is dealing with all the issues which she has described at the moment. Its staff are dealing with that but they have not got as much extra resource. I can assure the honourable gentleman that I am well aware of the Council  I am well aware of its work as the shadow minister for  I will say again I am in disagreement with you. The Council of Europe does not have a role in measuring the impact of legislation. If you will check the Record that is factual and not an opinion. Onto the third draft decision which I think as I said in opening is much more controversial, about the number of European Commissioners, one think I would agree with them is as he said this is an issue that has been debated over and over  not least in the recent treaty change, it is certainly an issue of great sensitivity for small and large member states. The Lisbon Treaty provided that from  from the next European  The number of European commissioners should be two thirds the number of member states. That was the position that we came to at the end of the negotiations on the Lisbon Treaty. As we know, Ireland asked for a change to this. I wanted to point out that there are or two sides to this argument. Some argue that it is too cumbersome, unwieldy and inefficient. That is especially given that now the EU is composed of 27 member states, soon to be 28 later this year. On the other side of the argument, there have been arguments put forward, particularly powerfully by smaller member states to have a Commissioner for each member State is the only way to secure equality for each member State. That certainly was the possession and still is of the Republic of Ireland. As my honourable friend the Justice Minister said in opening, we think that there is a case for looking at the possibility of introducing some degree of seniority in the college of commissioners. We have also advocated the creation of a growth Commissioner in the next Commission. As the explanatory notes set out to  the draft decision that we are discussing today will not apply beyond 2019. That comes to the intervention from the honourable gentleman opposite, nor if the you were to reach 30 member states or more, this draft decision would cease to apply. Whichever  -- earlier. I expect it will be 2019 rather than the 30th member joining. That is my  It is certainly DK's that it is still alive, sensitive, controversial and I am sure will give a subject of ongoing debate in the years to come. We will have to see what direction this debate  I think there are two sides to every argument. We have to respect the sense days -- sensitivities of smaller states. I was reminded that the opinion of Denmark was Al Gore they would prefer to have their own commissioner they would be willing to give that up on a rotating basis if it meant that the college of commissioners could operate in a more efficient manner. -- goalball the would be willing to give that  -- although. It is our intention to agree to these draft decisions will stop this has been a more a thorough and detailed debate than one might have initially anticipated but I am grateful to all of those who have spoken and contributed to this debate. As my right honourable friend said when he opened this the beat in a typically elegant and articulate introduction, the Prime Minister set out to examine the UK relationship with the European  These debates provide an opportunity to try to discuss the broader issues of our relationship with Europe. There will be many further opportunities to examine this relationship. I would therefore like to limit my remarks to the specifics of this Bill that is before us today. The first thing I would like to do his boot on the Record that it is of course because of the increased parliamentary control over the EU decisions that this Government has delivered, sued the European Union at 2011, in that no UK minister can vote in favour without first getting parliamentary  That is a very important point that a number of members have made this afternoon. I am happy to  Thank you for giving way. I find this interesting bill this morning on the internet. I looked up the explanatory notes which revert to the European Union and the European Council. What is the difference between the Council of the European Union and the European Council? Had the honourable gentleman been here for the whole debate he would have fared. I am happy to give way to honourable members who participate in this  even if they just wander into the chamber. We are debating the specific elements of this legislation today as it gives an opportunity for the House to consider a number of technical measures designed to make the EU more efficient and accessible. This Bill has parliamentary approval for the Government to agree with  We are required to see this approval before the Government can vote in favour. The first decision will give legal effect to the Journal of the European Union which will make access to EU law faster and more economically. The second will make the fundamental rights agency accessible for the next five years, this will direct the work of the agency into areas
