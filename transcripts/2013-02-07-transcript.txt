Hello. Welcome to the programme. The Leader of the House and the Lansley will announce the forthcoming business in the chamber and take questions. The energy teacher Secretary Michael Gove will make a statement MPs on changes to the curriculum and exams in England. He had plans to replace GCSEs with the English battle it but after opposition from teaching unions and the opposition those plans have been shelled. After that there are two backbench business debates one on subsidies for nuclear power and the second on the closure of accident and emergency departments. The Treasury Committee will be taking evidence from Dr Mark Carney, who is due to start as Bank of England governor in July. Because see that on our website. -- you can  Join us later for a wind-up of this as a would be in both Houses of Parliament at 11 o'clock tonight. The first of the questions comes from Conservative MP Harry Baldwin and it is about the number of women in the workplace. Order, order, Mr Alistair Carmichael. Chris Huhne, since his election has been appointed to the Office of Stuart or be left of her majesty's three children hundreds in the County of  The question is that I do issue my warrant to the clerk of the crown to make out any writ of the electing of a member to serve and the present parliament ordered or a constituency of Eastleigh in the room of Christopher Murray poll  has been appointed to the Office of Stuart or be left of her majesty were with the Chiltern hundreds in the County of  As many as of the opinion say I, contrary no, I think  please, Mr Speaker. The number of women in work is higher than at any time in British history. We will also commit to see more women in senior positions in you keep top companies, focusing on board representation. Did you know that in the last tax year, men paid �92 billion in income tax where women paid �36.8 billion which is  Normally I Dermot favour of lower income taxes but in this  could the Secretary of State explain to me what he is doing that would help equalise this and most importantly bring in an extra �55 billion to the Exchequer.

Indeed, raising the tax threshold will help low-paid women in particular to pay  which is one of our  but participation,  is a key objective of our policy and it will produce the quality which she strives for.  Mr Speaker. Warm words butter no parsnips. One of the things that hold up women in the workplace is the cost of childcare. Does the Secretary of State regret the reduction in child care tax credits on will be pressure for that to be reversed?The Government is supporting women with young children and families in general to the tune of about 5 billion, as a consequence of the childcare tax credit and free early years situation which has been extended to two year olds for low-income families and as a result of tax relief on employers' scheme. It is very substantial support for  Course the number of women in the workplace has been increasing for some time, but in  both women public servants faced with the threat of redundancy and women leaders of small businesses tell me that cuts to the rural councils are threatening their job security. And will the Secretary of State speak to his colleagues in the communities and local government department and ask them to rethink their approach or some of the heaviest cuts falling on places like Merseyside. It is never good when people lose their jobs, but the simple fact that in the Wirral, as in other parts of the country, the number of jobs lost in do public sector is far outweighed by the jobs created in the public  by over 1 million in the last two years. With permission, questions two and 12 per stop figures from the Bank of England show that between January 2011- December 2012 lending increased to UK businesses in six months and decreased and the others. The Governor of the Bank of England is working to increase funding through the increased lending scheme. Over the last two years, net lending has gone down by �28 billion. What is the Secretary of State doing, apart from these various feeling peace deal initiatives which do not get to the nub of the problem, which is a lack of consumer confidence, and the peeling of the banks, because of their lending criteria, to lend  What is he going to do that so that in two years' time he will have a better record? There was a serious issue which I frequently refer to in terms of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Government has supported about �7 billion of net  including 1 billion from the Enterprise guarantee scheme, but before we are lectured on this, we need to remember who was in charge when the banks collapsed. And if we go little bit further  He might recall as a member of the House for some years, the Cruickshank report in 2,000 which showed how banks were overcharging business customers and making excess profits. The last government had a chance to reform the banking system then and did absolutely nothing about it, which is why we Small and medium enterprises were owed a 36 billion in late payments  Will the Secretary of State back a campaign to investigate the issues around late payment? I welcome the contribution she has made in the House to that important issue. My colleague the minister of state has launched an initiative with business in order to reduce that problem. We have a trade financing scheme to try to make sure that credit does a fall through the proper chain. The key point is that credit does not solely depend on banks, it depends on the Beatles sector and manufacturing and we are providing support to small companies caught up and that problem.There was no doubt that businesses in Huntingdonshire are reporting that access to credit her significantly improved and that is very good news. He complains I am increasingly getting is that banks are becoming detached from customers, because of regionalisation and formulate processes they still cannot get to the right people. Is the Government addressing this issue?There has been a long-standing problem of the decline of relationship banking which underlines the problems you describe and the position is that last year, one thought of applications for loans to banks were declined, and when appeals were made to an independent  something like 40% were  which shows how bad the banks are in sifting good credit There is no silver bullet solution for all companies' financial days. What is he doing to diversify sources of finance for  particularly small and medium enterprises?We need to increase diversity in the system and provide wholesale financing for some of the new entrants into the  making the Government support concentrated an easy to  The plans are already under  The expert committee met for the first time a couple of days ago and we are already beginning to look at projects which will hopefully provide something of the order of �300 million, P it up with private money, over the course of  -- geared up. Small businesses tell me that banks will not lend to them because of the risk factor and the desire to increase their capital balances. The Government says it is going to introduce it business bank. Can the minister tell us when the business Bank will be up and running to address these problems and how will it operate in a different way, to overcome them? The business bank has already been organised. The expert group met on a bus time a couple of days ago and its products are already been prepared. We have to go through the state aid process, before it can operate fully. In the meantime it can operate within constraints. And it will make a significant contribution, I can Although we frequently hear prophets of doom, there is a lot of  there is a large amount of entrepreneurship.

He keeps saying he is going to miss it -- make a significant difference, but no one believes we will see  Can the Secretary of State confirm today that the government are following the policies he is advocating on access to finance for small businesses, and if not, can he explain what the government will do to make a difference about it?

With permission, I would like to answer a question three with question nine. Life Sciences strategy launched by the Prime Minister has already triggered over �1 billion of business investment, which is good for growth and the NHS. As he is  Macclesfield and North East Cheshire are known for their strong base in life sciences skills, and the economic contribution of such  What steps is he taking to encourage investment in the north-west? I pay tribute to work of my honourable friend, and I remember visiting the Astra Zeneca facility with them last year. There is a strong life sciences cluster in the north-west, and we are supporting it with extra investment in the new Manchester cancer research centre, and in the Manchester collaborative Centre Information Research. At a recent meeting of the Science and Technology Committee, Dame Sally  the chief medical officer, stated that the apocalyptic scenario is that when I need a new hip in 20 years, I will die of a routine infection because we have run out of antibiotics. Can he tell House what steps the Government are taking to fix what some people have described as the broken pipeline in the development for new drugs? I have heard Dame Sally Davis speak about that, which is why a understand the Secretary of State for Health will be launching an action plan on that issue in the  What we're doing is backing investment and ensuring a pipeline of new drugs for the future. It is what the new biomedical catalyst is  We can be confident of the support we are providing for medical research. I hope he will forgive me for describing the answer of his as a tad complacent. Talking to leading academics and investors and business, they think we are lacking behind in life sciences from the other countries we're competing with, particularly  and the fact is that they are worried that what will happen in life science is steadily happening in pharmaceuticals, losing the pharmaceutical industry  I believe the policies are securing us a strong position in the race. The protection for medical research, the new innovations taking products closer to market ensure that when companies look around, it is clear that Britain is the best bit -- best place to locate their activity.

Industrial strategy sets out a long-term approach to deliver greater certainty in growth and partnership in business, and we have published 10 sector strategies throughout 2013. This government is sending out confusing signals, no signal or the wrong signal to  What representations does he have from businesses on the impact of investment and growth regarding me in/out referendum?

Higher education reforms increase cash for teaching at universities and deliver more choice for students. Applications are up by 3%, and the proportion of 18-year-old applicants has increased to the highest level ever, and every English region has seen applications increase. With �9,000 tuition fees, universities are seeing variations in student numbers of up to 40% in some cases. What research has he done into the reasons behind a 13% drop in student numbers last year? The very Asian in applications as what happens when you have competition and the money going with the That is a key feature of  What we are doing this year is seeing applications up, and I would have thought that, given his concern about this issue, he would have welcomed the fact that the application rate for disadvantaged young people from England is at its highest ever 5%.

Does he share my campaign that government- backed UK loans and credits to developing countries should be for worthwhile projects based on responsible lending criteria and affordable repayment terms, and not to imperil sustainable economic growth in the countries concerned? Of course support by UK export finance should be to support growth that is sustainable but UK export finance has recently published on its website the sovereign debt owed to it by governments in order to become yet more transparent. Preparations for the review are under way and my department is fully engaged on the industrial  I called sure the defence group partnership that is addressing the competitiveness or the defence sector, and how we can better exploit the links between civil and military technologies. Can I do something unusual and thank the Minister of State for the LPG was saving a factory in Coventry? Can I ask the Minister what discussions he has had with a Rolls Royce and the possible impact to the supply chain and the loss of jobs? I know that he and the honourable member for Coventry north-west met us in the department  I met Rolls-Royce  We understand its decisions have to be made in response to changes in key international defence programmes. If he is referring to potential  he will know that any run-down is expected to take several years and that no final decision has yet been taking. The biggest single threat to British defence companies is the shortage of engineering skills which threatens a our prosperity, and security and their success. Can I ask my honourable friend to provide a sympathetic ear to plans to enable more young people, especially girls, to have couriers in technology and engineering? He will know that engineering apprenticeships are increasing in number and applications to study engineering are increasing, but the skills needs of this sector will be a key area of focus for the work of the defence group partnership. Redundant military of Defence says can offer the potential for new  Will the Minister recognise and nice to this as the Swindon- Roger local enterprise group when he considers this for the second wave ought City deals?That is an ingenious formulation in support of at Local Enterprise Partnership for we have to City deals which are under consideration at the moment. And I will certainly ensure that the use of redundant land is one of the aspects that we consider.Thank  Mr Speaker. The Government established the money advice service in July 2011 to co-ordinate free get advice. We support advice to the National Debt Line and Citizens Advice, but evidence suggests many people are unaware that there is free get advice and they can fall victim to profit- driven advisers. I am announcing a new initiative to protect consumers ensuring they know where to go for free debt management advice. Last weekend I listen to a pointless radio advert by the money advice service advising people how to get  Surely get advice by the mortgage should be focused on the abilities of a vulnerable families Iraq finding it difficult even to buy basic food or pay rent, far less to have the luxury of being able to obtain a mortgage. I thank the honourable member for a  I understand her frustration. The money advice service is also providing information on a wide range of financial issues and there was a role for that, too. She does highlight that it is important that free get advice is available and that awareness of that is raised. The new protocol published the day should help do that so that debt management providers to charge for services to poor people signed up  they will have to make them aware that free options are also a available, and that should help people do get the advice that  Last week I met with gaudy citizens advice to do an excellent job in my local community. Does he know that appalling human cost of Government measures such as the council-tax benefit, housing  and the crisis we expect to see in April when the universal credit is introduced. Does she regret scrapping their 500 citizens advice advisers at a time when there help is most needed? It is a little bit rich coming from the party opposite to talk about the difficult situation people aren't as if they had nothing whatsoever to do it with it. They left this country close to a very perilous economic situation. That is why this Government is helping more than 20 million people coming giving them an income tax cut and seeking 2 million of the lowest the people out of income tax altogether. We have reformed UKTI to show that it supports a small and medium enterprises. There are Willis grazing includes a plethora of local activity including MP- constituency trade seminars. 140 colleagues including me are having the Street seminars in their constituencies and I would ask members on all sides in get  I thank the Minister for that response. In my personal  UK commercial banks could indeed do more to promote trade finance. Does my honourable friend feel that they are doing enough to promote the services offered by UK trade finance? Not  but they are about to go. UK trade finance are establishing the regional advisers who, through the  lawyers and accountants, will reach more SMEs, and this is part and parcel of the widespread message that is going out to all  that if you want help in exporting, then UKTI is there Would the minister agree that one of the biggest frustrations for small businesses is the Government tendency to launch a plethora of schemes and press releases to go with them? Can I thank the Ministry for having a bonfire of the brochures, and setting up a better we're producing targeted advice. He can certainly make that comment, far better than  Mr Speaker, apprenticeships are designed to help people develop skills to the skill and progress with in a job. 17% of apprentices have some experience of work which the same employer before the start of their apprenticeship. I wonder if the minister could undertake to make it clear in all statements about apprenticeships how many of them are new stars and implement and how many of them are existing  because lots of the apprenticeship gain has come from converting the previous train to gain scheme into apprenticeships. Isn't that the case? It is very important not only for people to enter the workplace but to improve their skills within the workplace. For instance, 99% of those on management apprenticeships have some experience of work in that company before, and you would  It is about getting people out of that unemployment and also making sure people improve their skills whilst within jobs. The north London Chamber of Commerce has tonight hosting will local business awareness of apprenticeships programme. They are determined to exceed their recruitment of one another's and apprentices last year. Will the offer support for Johnson Matthey, who have led this? I would be very pleased to support them in the work they are doing to expand the number of people in apprenticeships and indeed to increase the quality of apprenticeships, because I know that they offer high-quality apprenticeships that there will worth getting involved in and raising awareness of.We have a Government whose latest figures show apprenticeships for young people under 19 down, 15%. Are ministers complacent to the risks to apprenticeships for over 24- year-olds for apprenticeships? Why is the minister still ignoring what we the committee have called for, government procurement contracts on projects like High Speed Rail, to make sure companies signed up thousands of new apprenticeships in order to win those contracts?The Shadow Minister does better when the take the politics out of apprenticeships, not least because there are a record number of apprenticeships starts. On the question of HS2, all I would say is that CrossRail, the largest construction project in Europe signed off by this Government has precisely the sort of arrangement that he asks for. Apprenticeships are rightly a focus for extra investment and extremely important  but does the Minister acknowledge there is an issue for some companies, when apprentices choose to leave, and is there a way of looking at ways of compensating the company that went through the apprenticeship scheme in the first The important thing is to ensure that the learning that happens within an apprenticeship is as relevant as possible to the company  and hopefully that will reduce the incidence of what he  We have a situation where schools and colleges do not promote apprenticeships for the most able students as an alternative to  What is the government doing to rectify this?

Question 1.My department plays a key role in supporting the rebalancing of the economy to deliver growth while increasing skills and learning. During visits to businesses in my constituency, they have reported welcome news that there are increases in orders from abroad as but they are concerned about the time it takes to get export orders. What is the Department doing to speed this up? The Export Control Organisation is currently meeting its primary target to approve 70% of licence applications within 20  and last year met its secondary target of approving 95% within 60 working days. I understand the frustration of legitimate exporters and the export control organisation is working with the Foreign Office to improve performance further. The EU council is gathering as we speak. From the Common Agricultural Policy to the absurdity of the European Parliament sitting in two places, it is clear that EU needs reform. It is also clear that any reform requires us a boost by a substantial amount of power from here to the EU, and therefore a referendum is needed. Does he agree that whilst reform is crucial, the immediate priority for British business is to grow the economy and that continued membership of the EU is fundamental to that goal? I do  The way that he phrased the question suggests that despite some -- despite some of the drama, there is a lot of common ground. All party leaders want us to remain within the European Union, and recognise the need for radical reform and the need for a referendum. Picking up on my honourable friend's question  I have spoken to many businesses who think the Prime Minister's approach towards the EU risks Britain tumbling out of  Already companies in numerous sectors, 170 jobs, have reiterated the importance of the membership to the EU for their  A letter to the Prime Minister said government must build more certainty and confidence for business to invest.

With youth unemployment falling, is it not more important than ever that we are preparing for young people to enter work properly with the right skills, something a college in my constituency is doing great walk-on.

I am familiar with the side which is important for child to Trainspotting, as I recall! I am very happy to meet with him and have discussed this with the council leader. It is not clear what the scale of infrastructure investment is needed, but we are keen to take this for a word. Does he share my concern that businesses are being included that have a value in excess of 10 million? Those businesses would otherwise be categorised as... And would like to congratulate him on the word he has done on behalf of the 100,000 companies that have been mis-sold  it was a terrible scandal. The position is now much better, but he is right that there are some anomalies in the definition of sophisticated companies, which is not confined to scale. The Secretary of State knows that Nissan is vital to the north-east long-term economy and provides much-needed jobs and investment. Isn't there a significant risk that the uncertainty of Britain's future in Europe could jeopardise this? I am aware of the importance of Nissan to the north-east.

I appreciate that.

In a two-year session. So I am happy to be able to say to the shadow leader  in this session, which is not a two-year session, we are published 10 bills in draft, and I hope that we will have matched the record of the previous session. The Shadow Leader asked me about my colleagues at DeFra. As she will  in relation to the equine theme to the shadow leader's  she asked about... Indeed! I didn't say anything else!

She will recall that in that debate, my noble friend Lord McNally made it clear that in the course of next week we expect to be able to publish proposals relating to response to the Leveson recommendations and in doing so,  on a cross-party basis, and it is because we want to secure cross-party agreement that we are acting together, and that way, and to that extent, the amendment passed in the other place was clearly premature and I hope that when people see the proposals as they might come for work that we're all actively seeking to ensure that we achieve the recommendations, the principles set out in the Leveson  in a way that continues to respect the need for freedom of the  free from political  Curiously, the shadow leader seems to be a scene to seek from me from a Chancellor a Budget statement prior to the Budget  We will settle for one Budget statement.

The Governor of the Bank of England is giving evidence to the Select Committee of the Treasury right now, but we know from what we have had said internationally that it is clear that the commitment of this coalition government to the reduction of the structural deficit, to the achievement of a financial, fiscal consolidation, has bought allowed for the active monetary policy that has been support for or activity in this country not withstanding international  and has gained us the credibility that has contributed to the confidence that has brought 1 million more jobs since the election and low interest rates, which were of this age of  not least to mortgage  -- which were or central importance not least to mortgage holders in this country. The Labour Party and the computes situation of complaining about the level boring and wanting us to borrow more in circumstances where they were responsible for the most appalling inheritance of debt. She asked about the motion before the House last night relating to the House sitting on 22nd March. It is very straightforward. I have announced previously that there was a calendar that has allowed members and indeed the House to plan ahead. The calendar was very clear that, for the Easter recess, the House would rise on Tuesday 27th March. And colleagues will have planned and that basis. In order, therefore, falling the Budget on 20th March, to accommodate the requirements of the budget debate and the needs of the backbench business committee for a tree recess adjournment debate would need the House to sit on 22nd March, and they hope that the House will recognise that, that it is for the benefit of the House in securing business, including backbench time, for the bees.

It will be a matter for the University of Leicester, in due course, to take account of the the interment of which are that there, but I sure, as the shadow leader does, I hope that the interest generated by this discovery of the remains will enable not least young people and those interested in history, to recognise what the significant date 1485 was in the history of this  Dozens of members are trying to catch my eye, but follow, in this case from the Secretary of Following the announcement by the Minister of the Department for  Innovation and Skills during last night's debate on post private business, that the consultation period on the reform to the laws on street trading is to be extended by one month, this will be an opportunity for members on all sides of the house to contribute to that consultation. They are the ultimate in Micra  and the need to insure there is no danger of them being regulated out of existence.Thank  I am sure the House remains to be interested in this debate. I heard the Minister say that the consultation has been extended and that the promoters of those for private Bills were well aware of that and able to accommodate it in relation to their bills. I am sure the House will have an opportunity at the next business questions to ask a question about that.

Could we have a debate on how foreign companies can be prevented from buying British companies closing them after a short period of time, after removing their assets and sending them to China. 80 jobs in my constituency are under threat because of this, and it is not the first time this has happened in recent years. It is never easy to reconcile oneself to these things, but we live in an international  and we need to win in the global race. Frankly the capacity of investors to come here and invest in this country is integral to that free movement of capital across the world.

Can we have a debate on the success of the National Lottery and help the community groups found their way through funding schemes to benefit the local communities? He is right to highlight this, and may I join with him to say that the Pennine Sailing Club and the archery club, they will be very deserving recipients of lottery funding  Along with what has now accumulated with 4,000 community groups across the country benefiting Big Lottery Fund Inc since it was established. For those organisations who want to access lottery funding money, there are many ways to do this, including on  At yesterday's Prime Minister's Question Time, it was clear that the Prime Minister had no idea about the implications of his bedroom tax. Can we have a debate on that issue, so that the Prime Minister can get up to speed? On the contrary. I thought the Prime Minister absolutely understood to that housing benefit has risen dramatically, it is essential to control the level of housing benefit. He was clear that under the last Labour government, the kind of rules that are being applied to social housing had been applied to private rented accommodation and why should there be a difference? Equally he was clear that we have, in circumstances where resources are  we have to ask why are the funding what is approaching one million unused bedrooms in the social housing sector, where we 8 million people looking for housing from the social housing waiting list?

Our council topped the league for the number of staff suspended and the length of time they have been  with one member of staff suspended for 2.5 years on full pay. At the same time the council has refused to be �0.6 million from the government to freeze council tax, preferring to raise it to the third highest in London. Could we have a debate on inefficiency in local government? He makes an important point in relation to his own constituency and a local authority. He will have an opportunity next week to raise issues about securing value for money in his constituency  I am sure the Leader of the House is not aware, but I will  is he aware that at 9:30am this morning, the Post Office is putting out to franchise 50 Crown offices across the constituencies  They did not appear to tell the minister responsible. He did not know about this announcement. Could we have a statement about what the Post Office's are up to? And what the conditions will be if they cannot find a franchisee and what impact it has on the government to seek an arrangement for the future of the Post Office? He correctly understands these are matters he might have raised in the course of business questions. The honourable gentleman was not called! And I noticed he was a late entrant to  Other members who have been longer I thought were more deserving at the time! I am accustomed to questions to me being described as poor man's Prime Minister's Questions. But I will Securon answer to the honourable gentleman from my ministerial  But I might say we're clear that there will be no programme of post office closures under this government. Every week, my local papers tell us about cases where serious offenders have been brought to justice through advances in DNA and the DNA database, but the Government seems to think there are far too many people on the DNA database and trying to find a way to take them off. Can we have a debate on the effectiveness of it in bringing offenders to justice, and how we can use it to maximum effect to help the police bring these people to justice? I think he addresses an important point which we understand is a need for there to be effect amiss in using these latest forensic techniques to enable us to tackle crime, but at the same time to protect civil liberties are, not to be held where there is no good reason for the authorities to retain them? The balance is something that has been  but I know my colleagues will be happy to answer questions and discuss it in the future.

You he will recall when my honourable friend was here answering questions relating to this, I recall her referring to this, I will be encouraged her to identify if there is for the opportunity to update the House on the the Dundon see arrangements for Remploy workers. - - the redundancy arrangements. Some members seem to take sport in delaying the passage of bills, against did order of the House, which can delay bills for three  Could I ask for an urgent review in the process of voting for private bills? I am most grateful, but I am sure he does not want a review but a statement? I never fail to be impressed by the judgment of the chair in relation to these matters! We work within the standing orders of the house, and I would encourage my honourable friend to address his points with his evidence to the Procedure  Can I press him again on the urgent need for a debate on the bedroom tax, where the Prime Minister is present? He needs to understand the consequences that this will have on thousands of people in this country, this -- I would say to the honourable  The Prime Minister was clear about the necessity of this. We did not hear any explanation from the party opposite how they would propose to meet the financial requirement that we have to control expenditure. They after you do saying debates that we must control  but every measure that is brought forward on the benefit cap in relation to housing benefit  they have resisted. You can criticise in circumstances where you do not have a credible alternative. Following the publication yesterday of the Frances report, will the Government make time for a debate in this chamber so that MPs can discuss the report and its conclusions? In response to my honourable friend and members who will be very concerned to ensure that the report is fully debated, he may know that a number of Staffordshire members of Parliament have sort of debate through the backbench is this  something that committee will consider. I will be happy to decide whether that is something they can accommodate. The Foreign Office has withdrawn these arrangements for children from  depriving many from receiving respite care in constituencies like mine in power. Can we have a debate about how the Foreign Office decides these arrangements and try to persuade the minister to change his mind about this appalling decision? From  so correct me if I am wrong, ministers at the Foreign Office have met representatives from seeking to continue these concessionary these arrangements. I will of course ensure that the honourable gentleman is informed of the result of those discussions. But I cannot answer that question  If the backbench business committee is good enough to grant the debate on the shambles at mid- Staffordshire Hospital, can I ask my honourable friend to avoid any government statements on that you might so that we can have a full debate of the implications of the France's report, because after what we learned about the culture of box-ticking managing realism, it seems that those who close their eyes to reform of the NHS should  and let us get on with  My honourable friend understands we endeavour to keep the House fully informed of announcements of Government policy through statements, but at the same time not to seek to impede the business of the House. It is always a balance and we endeavour to strike it well. Many members of this House will feel strongly, understandably, a about what role we Francis had to say in his report. I feel strongly about it. It demonstrates that it was absolutely the right thing to do to under its -- to appoint Robert Francis to undertake that inquiry. It points to the culture of changes that the NHS needs now, and has needed for a  There has been a lot about structures.

It would mean the Prime Minister would not be able to answer in relation to the budget for four weeks by which time almost every element will have been undone, so the Prime Minister will have to do a massive apology to everybody for having misled everybody all the way along for four weeks. Wouldn't it be better for the Prime Minister took lead the debate on the second day, or to sit on the Wednesday? I published the calendar for the House last October. It's set out clearly that used 26th March was to be the day that the House would  therefore it is possible for the business of the House to be accommodated by that date, but it requires us to sit on the Friday for that to happen. Not withstanding the leader's comments earlier in response to my honourable friend there is an evident lack of democratic accountability within the NHS and I am sure members have come up against those barriers at various  Could the leader find time for a debate on that particular issue?

And all we're going to get, apparently, is a written statement. That is not good  We need a full statement and a full debate on this significant deployment of British troops in that area that might last for a very long time and should be of great concern to everybody in  Can we have a debate with a motion that can be voted on, so that we can discuss the long- term objectives of the British deployment? I noted what the honourable gentleman said in his point of order yesterday. I will reiterate what I said to the shadow Leader of the House, that they will insure with my colleagues, that there is a report to the House next week before the House rises. But, we continue to look carefully to ensure that we make, fully, the convention that before there is a commitment of armed forces to conflict and combat, that this  for any substantial period  should have an opportunity to debate that. This has an order and character to it, but also, it is not the intention or plan of the Government in any sense to commit our forces to combat and conflict. I very much welcome this Government's increasing the income tax threshold, lowering corporation tax and working with local authorities to freeze council tax for the third year, and scrapping the fuel duty escalator as well. A report earlier this week said that if we were to abandon Air Passenger  we could increase economic activity by �18 billion a year, and increase GDP by 0.46 %. Can we,  have a debate on how a further tax reductions can stimulate the economy further? My honourable friend understands that the level of tax sect has to be in a way that organises revenue whilst minimising impact on economic performance. That is a constant effort on the part of the Treasury. It is one of the reasons why reducing the top rate of tax to 45p makes economic sense as well as revenue sense. But we have done it in the context of completely understanding, which is what the Institute of Fiscal Studies has agreed in its analysis, that the wealthiest 10% are making the greatest contribution following the Government's tax changes, to meeting requirements for fiscal consolidation. I try to raise this in Prime Minister's Questions and I was an early arrival on that  The Leader of the House has said how passionate he is about free markets and global capitalism  when it comes to media  that is a different  We should have a statement or a debate on the fact that Virgin Media might be taking over by a an eccentric American  and that means two American and rather strange people warning our media. When are we going to have a statement about that? The honourable gentleman is in danger of confusing a belief, that I do have, that if we are to be competitive, we have to do it in a global marketplace, and there are consequences in terms of the flow of capital and investment, to enable that to happen. You cannot confuse that with the belief that competition and rigorous competitive authorities is essential to make that happen. I will take no lessons from Labour and that because it was as a backbencher, together with Lord  that we wrote the provisions put into the communications bill, to apply a public interest test to any media  Can we have a debate on repeat the Spanish military incursions into British waters off  and how robust the British response should be? I will,  be glad to see if there is anything but there that needs to be said in relation to this.

Can we have a debate on at Leicester's historically dodgy are frankly bogus claim to the remains of which have the third? Yorkshire is the only place that these can be put. The legal position is very straightforward. The licence gives to the University of Leicester an obligation but also discretion as to the choice of the location for the interment of Richard the Third's remains. There will be other claims. And I completely understand the claims of Westminster Abbey and also be York We really do need that urgent debate on the bedroom tax and particularly exemptions. My constituent is a foster carer, and she needs the extra bedroom. She provides a service to vulnerable  She should not be penalised for that. The deductions from the housing benefit were explained very carefully to the House previously. What she has to understand is that, in addition, as the Prime Minister said, there rather sources provided in addition to make those specific requirements and local authorities can respond to those circumstances. Could we have a debate on the excellent Mary Portas pilot scheme and what the Government can do to bring life back into high streets and town centres?The funding of �2.3 million is only one a little part of the effort that it has enabled, the multiplier effect in high streets is important, including those be on the pilot scheme. Perhaps not least it might be  slightly, to extend the debate on local government finance, but I hope it could be one of the mechanisms used next week in debate about how local authorities can use the resources effectively to I have had a letter from Bob Dylan's manager to say that he is prepared to perform in the summer  and I wonder if he would find time to come to the concert and to timetable a debate and cultural icons and the literary icons for UK and Wales in this House before 2014?

Following on from my honourable friend from  as a proud Yorkshireman, could I ask for a debate on returning Richard the third, the Last King of the House of York, to his rightful resting place, the City of York?

I am sorry to hear what he has to say about his constituents family, and those circumstances. On March 5th, he might like to look at something he could raise them. Or he could look at an adjournment debate, which might be appropriate. On December  I tabled a question asking each department her many -- his department how many computers and tablets there were. I wondered if the Leader of the House could use his influence to get an answer. I also tabled a question on 16th January but have not had an answer. I am anxious to ensure we are all was timely in our answers to  and I will endeavour to get an answer.Will the arrange a seminar for all ministers to explain the precise meaning of the word question, the meaning of the word answer, and the need for a link between the two? I will not organise such a seminar, I think this is understood! In education questions I raced a delay to the rebuilding of a school in my constituency due to government financing issues. But the Leader of the House impress upon his ministerial colleague the urgency of the matter, as I have yet to receive a mixed -- a response. My honourable friend is on the bench and he will no doubt have heard it. Can we have a debate on the best use to which the government can put a rather hefty fines which some banks are paying in LIBOR manipulation, and does the government did the it would be a good idea to transfer the money to a new Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh? -- to the Government think it would be a good idea? I think the house would agree very well by being transferred in support of the military covenant, but I will raise with Treasury colleagues the suggested he makes for the future. Will he give consideration to holding a debate on the effects of the bedroom tax in Glasgow? Is he aware that the tax will remove £80 million in here from the Glasgow economy, cost 202 jobs and lower wages by 5.3 million?

Can I ask the Leader of the House to consider a debate on the bedroom tax. No government backbencher turned up to defend this policy recently.

I'm happy to acknowledge this was an error. One thing we did not hear from the shadow Secretary was his view on that reform because when the shadow Secretary wrote to me on that Wednesday SEP- 2012, he said, I welcome the proposal to introduce single exam boards. I acknowledged that was a mistake. In the brief moment when he had the House of Commons and the palm of his hand, I'm afraid he did not enlighten us as to what his view was on single exam boards. He did not tell us about the occasional qualifications or apprenticeships or A-levels. He asks if I will work with others. I am delighted there is cross-party consensus on a reform to the occasional qualifications. As there is on it apprenticeships. I am delighted there is support for changes took A-levels and university entry, as I have acknowledged. I hope to see there will be consensus around her we reform GCSEs.

Can I congratulate my honourable friend for his statement and on the publication of the new National Curriculum. Does he share my view that the 2007  written by the QCA and introduced by the last government was hugely damaging to educational standards in this country and to the cultural and scientific literacy of school students and the new curriculum published today will do enormous amounts to raise standards and undo that damage to our curriculum on a par with the best in the world?

I welcome the degree of humility and a welcome many of the changes which had been announced this  Not least in terms of the range of subject areas which will now account for the value added tables and for the GCSEs. Will he confirm that all these subjects will now be of equal weight and that citizenship will remain at not only in the curriculum but also with the national programme of study? I am very grateful to him for his distinguished tenure of education secretary but the way in which he responded so and which others can learn from. I can confirm that citizenship will remain a programme of study at key stages 3 and 4. I look forward with working -- to working with the right honourable gentleman. I welcome the announcement today and am pleased that the Secretary of State has listened to concerns of headteachers in my region.

When I said that I would have a crack at changing the mind of the Secretary of State for education, I didn't believe I would be here thanking him for changing his mind. I do do that.

A lot of us think it is the certainty leading to arrogance of the Secretary of State that led him to read out of 10 pages of waffle. All he needed to do was say sorry, got it wrong, will do better. I'm grateful, as ever, to the honourable gentleman for lessons in how to avoid arrogance, and how to acknowledge we have made mistakes  As in so many areas, he is my model in all things. In the recent past, examining boards have competed to offer better results. This has been a driver of grade inflation. Now we are moving away from having a single board per subject.

We have made significant savings in the last three years by concentrating on better value for money. This move will save money for a variety of schools and students by making sure that modules and coursework which absorbs so much energy and time will no longer be absorbing time and money. We should enhance aspiration of all pupils, especially those from more income  We should also do something about a grade inflation, if any public examination is to have value. Could I also say, the only point in having consultation is to listen, and having listened, one respects those who has consulted and that is a mark of ministerial strength, not  I am very grateful to their honourable gentleman. I have strong views about improving the education system. I am happy to debate in any forum. I also believe that it is through debate that we can reach a consensus about how best to proceed.

I come from two related perspectives. I will speak about the general economic better fitness of our nation and a need for nuclear to be part of the mix to help with that. The first point is  from a constituency point of  Hartlepool has had a power station for 30 years. It is currently operated by EDF.

The only thing which seems to be clear is that we have no clear strategy on nuclear energy.

I would suggest that the market decline is in the nuclear power industry when pitted against alternatives. I would like to lead the Secretary of State with four questions and one frightening statistic. Why are the again to a contractual set price in contravention of the coalition agreement not to allow subsidies. Why has his contract been presented as a non-renewable document to Parliament? Will the Secretary of State consider at the Glee on these negotiations until such times as committees have had a chance to review whether the present value  -- consider I delay. Using formal has developed, the strike cost price which they have calculated, set against the wholesale price today, and the 30 year contract life for the two plants at Hinckley and Sizewell, it would called -- it would cost households and businesses £155 billion by 2015 and that is without any additional cost identified  Imagine, the renewable Energy Industry, if we had invested over £155 billion we would be world leaders and I would have ever a confidence it would be a low carbon We are in an extraordinary situation where we are charging ahead to a financial crash on this. Huge sums of money will be spent and Parliament is in ignorance of the details of what is going on. That must be changed. We have heard from the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee saying that the committee has no responsibility until the contract is signed. By then it will be too late and we will be committed to a period of probably 30 years to pay an enormous cast to a company that is  that is in France, and is already subsidised again. It is  We have seen the stampede of all the company is -- companies from investing in nuclear power. And for good reasons. It is a financial basket case.

If we look at the history of nuclear power, and it has been a series of four stalls all my life, I remember electricity that was supposed to be too cheap to  It was one of the worst civil investments ever. It produced nothing of value. Margaret Thatcher had plans to bring 10 nuclear power  and only one was built. We are now in a position where my party was seduced by the pulling power of nuclear power recently. I  I don't have a nuclear station in my area. That is on record to begin with. But in this  we will not build some great new generation of stations but import electricity from abroad, probably from French nuclear This is a limited view of the history of this. But we were  and my own party took the view as recently as 2007, that nuclear was economically unattractive.

Within a year, the Labour government had changed  and the life of the technology was advanced and the gap  We were seduced into a view their nuclear was inevitable. All parties went into the next election -- last election thinking it was acceptable if there were  I had a debate in 2008 in this House about the assurance that government was presenting to nuclear power. If you remember the most recent cost was 200 billion, at the Chernobyl, and the taxpayer would have to pay that... I give  I agree with what he says, although I must correct him in saying that all parties went into the last election supporting nuclear power. The Lib Dems did not. We were opposed. I did not think he was going to reply to this debate! I could spend my time quoting what the honourable gentleman said, what many other members said. Why has this change? They did not believe in nuclear power. They went in with a promise of no subsidies. But the honourable gentleman, who, again, has been attracted by the red boxes and has had some kind of ministerial lobotomy, that he no longer can see what is obvious, they're nuclear power, which she always believed in, and was only two years ago, is eight mistake. When the policy statement went through the chamber, not even Lib Dem ministers voted for it. The coalition agreement was that we would abstain at that time. I hope the Lib Dem party will return to the path of virtue. I asked to a question in this chamber and praise the Minister for what he has done in investing money in wind  and urged him to do the same as far as tidal power is concerned.  and I can't give way  my constituency, like that of many other members on the English side, is what does matter washed by a cliff of water that goes up and down the estuary. -- is washed by a cliff of water.

It will be  cleaning, British, very  In France, they have a power station for tidal energy. It produces the cheapest electricity  They should have developed that rather than going the other way. We are now in a position where, thanks to the views of our committee, we got a clear picture of what the future is. If we could look at the enormity of the sums involved, Tom Burke, who was an adviser to a previous  said the scale of investment is large. The contract will last for a very long time. At a strike price of £100 and a 30 year contracts laugh, this would require a subsidy of £1 billion per  -- a 30 year contract. This would translate to a transfer of £30 billion to EDF, a French  from the pockets of British tax payers. It could cost householders and businesses £150 billion by 2050. I put forward a motion in 2008 forecasting that the future would be that any profits that might be made by nuclear power would be enjoyed by foreign  We have seen the stampede going on. The companies are all going, for business reasons. Any profits would be enjoyed in  But the enormous cost of it would be paid by British taxpayers. The great liability, and it is an astonishing figure, is for looking after nuclear waste. A report said in 1976 that it is irresponsible to go on generating electricity for nuclear power without a solution to  £67.5 billion, and now we are continuing with the waste, and there is not an answer. The answer then was to dig a hole and  Order, order. Does somebody want to speak? I am pleased to have a chance to speak in this debate. I wanted to address two points he made. One, are we making a subsidy? We are paying more for nuclear than we would pay if we let the market  Whether it is a subsidy or  I don't know. I believe we have to address the carbon issue. Nuclear power is part of that  The contracts for differences a way of -- the contract for difference is a way of treating this. The other point I have heard people make is that it is a reasonable thing to subsidise new technologies such as wind and Solar and all of the rest. Nuclear is an old technology. I think that is a false argument. It is like saying physics is an old technology, it started in about 1,900. Nuclear is changing and evolving as new types of power developed. It is a difficult argument to maintain. We have to talk about whether or not we are serious about reducing  and if we are, it is hard to see that nuclear is not part of the solution. My honourable friend makes an excellent point. The latest designer prove for the new reactors used by EDF are more  -- the latest designer approved. I don't know if they are more  Why wouldn't they be? I believe we should not go nuclear if there are low carbon technologies that can outperform it at scale and within the timescale we need. There are issues with nuclear. The issue for the House, though, is, is the fact more severe than the issue of global we have -- warning -- global-warming? The waste tries is  There's no pun in that. The global warming issue is not containable. He makes a powerful argument. He talks about the waste. I think the House knows that what we are talking about his legacy waste that the government has not dealt with. It needs to be dealt with today.  on the other hand, before anything comes out, that will be 50 years in the future. The issue of nuclear waste is now not just from civil and nuclear but from the defence industry and health as well. I agree. The issue of legacy waste, frankly, is not relevant to this discussion. It is not a great advert for the nuclear industry either. It is also true that much of the waste problem is health-related.

The first choice is to use less. There is no question that is the best thing we could do. Another choice, which I like least, is in force.

In terms of the case for nuclear, let me be clear, our problems, like nuclear waste, it has not been fixed. People think that is a pervasive reason for not going ahead with it. That is a legitimate view. I believe it is a smaller risk than the risk of global warming and the need for work reducing carbon. Nuclear purports to be cheaper in terms of strike price.

I wanted cooked on the record a couple of things which I think are important about the Liaison Committee, about how we can get parliament to scrutinise policies which government has taken  In congratulating my honourable member for bringing this business debate to the House today, the issue which it has set out is that his new nuclear going ahead with or without public subsidy?

We are in this double whammy of the situation. I wish to ask the Secretary of State,  in future discussions that he has with the Liaison  if he can look again at the committee recommendations which set out it was a mistake by the government to muddle together nuclear with renewables.

I would not want the government now and in the future, when looking at decommissioning nuclear waste, to be held over a barrel as a result of a decision we make now which will have a lasting legacy for years ahead. Given the recent threats we have heard from EDF, we are already been held over a barrel and being held -- asked for extraordinary levels of subsidy. There should be declining but it seems to be increasing. I absolutely agree d. In view of what has happened with Centrica this  and the uncertainty about how you new nuclear power stations will get constructed, everyone is being held over a barrel.

I thank him for that  No, I think winds has an important part to play. I think we should have subsidies in the nuclear power industry as well. They are a lot of misconceptions about their industry. The reality is different. All three companies are building their plans at their own expenses. Contracts do guarantee a price for the electricity when it is priced -- when it is produced. It is impossible to raise £7 billion for the power station built unless they know what the prices might be. That is why we need these contracts.

Those questions are at the heart of this government's policy on nuclear  Before I tend to this key issue of the cost of subsidies, let me address recent issues affecting nuclear policy and this debate.  G G F. -- G G F. It was the priority of the last government to ensure the safe management of nuclear waste. Britain has a huge legacy of nuclear material to store and dispose of, whether or not we build a single new nuclear reactor. As we develop our new programme, it is right to press ahead with tackling that legacy. I believe that geological disposal is the right policy for the long-term safe and secure management off radioactive waste. What happened in Cumbria convinced me even more, because both councils voted Yes to the next phase of work to identify possible sites for disposal. The community's most likely to host a facility wanted it. But the government had agreed that Cumbria County Council also needed to vote in favour for this to proceed to the next stage. They did not. That is disappointing. The invitation for communities to come forward and remains open. This is a long-term programme looking over the next century and beyond to build a geological disposal facility. The programme will be successful.

If this has happened, I have no doubt it happens elsewhere and will continue to happen elsewhere. Let me illustrate. When I return to my home town in 1999, we had a department called A&amp;E. Subsequently I find that it was not an A&amp;E at  It was a sort of minor injuries unit with a big notice over the top that said A&amp;E.

It was to do with the clinicians, those in charge of the local NHS, who eventually grasp the nettle and  this is no longer an A&amp;E. The fuss was disproportionate.

I do not understand how it A&amp;Es can continue to function like this, how the ambulances, crucial ambulance  how their protocols... What on earth is a protocol, for heaven's sake? Would he agree that what we need is clear definitions of what emergency departments do across the country? We have so many different types of what are called A&amp;Es that are very different. Some may have a major trauma, some may  Some do it acute stroke and heart attack, some do not. It is vital there is classification recognised across the country by ambulance services. My honour or friend has clearly been reading my notes! That is exactly my point. I know that if you ask, what is the composition of the anti-tank platoon of the Royal Anglian Regiment compared with the Parachute Regiment, you will see that they are at the same, there is no difference. Why do we have this Baizai and Tyne -- Byzantine set of organisations in the NHS who say, and A&amp;E can be a sort of A&amp;E are perhaps not an A&amp;E, or perhaps have a notice outside which is misleading?

It was clear from early on in my view and the view of the cross party campaign group led by a hard work chair, his Ward that the aims were to remove core services from my local hospital. Irrespective of the consultation. This was not the first time the trust had tried to remove core services from the area. Only five years earlier they had tried to downgrade our maternity services. The trust at the time claimed it would be safer and provide more sustainable services.

I was uneasy as so many local clinicians started to share their concerns with me about the proposals.

For securing this debate. I will come back to a few things that the honourable gentleman said. I think he has the thrust of a lot of problems with the four tests. But I think his attitude towards them is The tests that are being talked about today were invented for the reconfiguration of Chase Farm  It is clear if you look at what happened there, because this predates the discussions we are having today, it did not matter what local opinion was, what local medical opinion was. Everyone's -- everyone was a post but they were determined to go ahead. -- a post. Everything takes on the farce. The tests do not add up in terms of protecting local services. I think he has it exactly. That is precisely the experience in  It shows is that the four tests are a fig-leaf and entirely inconsequential. The Secretary of State can simply announce that he has decided they have been met and that is all that counts.

It is the Secretary of State saying, yes, it is exactly that and that is the  My right honourable friend for Lewisham and Deptford went over a lot of the ground that is concerning us, about the outrageous proposals that have come forward for -- from the trust special administrator. But let me emphasise that the reason for the anger and the out rage and the fury and a sense of seething injustice and a sense of seething injustice that exists in Lewisham is not because people there are particularly prone to scare stories, but because they know exactly what is going on and they know they are being punished for the feelings of  This is at a time when Lewisham Hospital has made every effort to to meet both the financial targets and the service targets and to retain the confidence of local people.

Simply patronising and condescending and sighing, you don't understand what we understand, is not the way to treat citizens of this country. The threat posed by the use of this regime in the south London health care trust is a threat to every single trust in  If the government can get away with it in the way it has conducted it in Lewisham, it will be able to do this anywhere. The whole scheme has been designs, promoted and decided by the Department of Health without any objective external appraisal. The object of the exercise in this case was to revive a dormant scheme to reduce south-east London A&amp;Es at hospitals and from five to four. It came from a clever delayered review and it was a plan that was rejected both by the review and bites the subsequent review of that review by the chair of the trust board at King's College Hospital. It did not survive because it does not make sense on clinical grounds. What is happening now in south London is lead entirely on financial grounds. By doing this a VIA at the back door or organisation, although originally there was a denial but this was eight reconfiguration, unfortunately last night -- last  he did confirm that it was indeed a reconfiguration. Had they been honest and straight forward and told the truth from the outset it would have gone through an entirely different procedure, one that would have been agreeable to external review and one where there would have been an appeal procedure. One where there would have had to stand FOR taking the action that they now contemplate. This has been engineered entirely by the officials and their acolytes within the fortress of Richmond House. All of the clinical evidence that they had taken at any notice of was paid for either by people working in the Department of Health or brought in in the so-called clinical advisory group by the trust commissionaire.

I have to win the hearts and minds of the people they serve and that is why we should not be taking lectures on the role of MPs and Democrats. I unapologetically would like to talk about my hospital, which has been introduced you briefly by the Member for Edmonton, my neighbour. It is Chase Farm Hospital, which must predate, as a hospital which has been facing threats of change, not all good, probably predates just about every member in this  perhaps with the exception of the Member for Islington North.  going back to early 1990s, Accies Farm was promised the proceeds from the disposal of a hospital called Highlands. It crosses more than one government. I will try and tell us in a non- partisan way. My interest is, what I can get for my constituents. After being let down with the promise for investment from the sale of the Highlands Hospital, no money was forthcoming. In 1999, there was an administrative merger between Barnett and Chase Farm  We were assured that this would lead to no chemical changes and it would have  The effect was their healthy balance sheet, and the Member for Lewisham may identify  they have the balance sheet of Chase Farm was sucked right to support a hospital that was bleeding payments. Again, my constituents were let down. Just  we were told we would have an £80 million investment in our district general hospital. Shortly after, in 2006, that did not materialise and we started the programme of downgrade and reconfiguration, as it is known, particularly in maternity and A&amp;E. That was then confirmed in 2008. Eight judicial review by the local council held it up. As hopes were beginning to rise with the change of government, our hopes were raised again from the moratorium. As I said on the floor of this  my constituents were actually let down by the Secretary of State when again, we were  You understand why trust and transparency, in my case for my constituents, and I'm sure it resonates across the House, is very much at the heart of why the public that the acute hospitals serve are so sceptical when they are on the receiving end of advice My opposition stands because of the inconsistency of what we have been  It has been either been a clinical case for change, or a clinical and safety case for change and yet n 2011 the CQC said my hospital was actually running up to  Then it emerged about the PFI and let me be clear, a PFI deal that was sealed for north mids, a neighbouring hospital, undertook an investment of £129 million over  And a total Rayment over £64 -- £640 million. As the Secretary 06 state -- of state said at the time, in the daily mail, having downgraded, in part it was because of unsustainable PFI debt. But one reason so often cited for the actual downgrade of my hospital, proposed downgrade, this a GPs  Well let me be clear and I hope the minister will ask officials to look at this. It is true because three hospitals were part of the downgrade plan, Barnett, and elsewhere, GP s were asked, from Haringey, Barnett and Enfield. It was like a communist meeting the way they asked the vote F you ask people in Haringey do they have a problem with the downgrade in chase  I suspect they will say no. And likewise in Barnett. But when you look at the figures, 44% only of Enfield GPs approved of it. But of 129 GPs asked, only 48 responded. So it was actual lay positive 16% recorded support it. I hope the minister may ask officials to reflect on that point. I would like to turn to some issues now. Because the question before us is yes, I  but I recognise I need to fight for the best deal for  I believe it is important we examine the so conditions of the  that we were promised would be put in place. I will. Can I commend on his efforts. If he wish to take a seat. That is my job.  But it is only he has been standing up and he has continuously stood up in this house and for his constituents, standing against the closure of Accident and Emergency. He has secured a cross party delegation meeting with the Secretary of State. Can we ask that at that meeting we are able to get the assurance that the £16.6 million than invested in primary care in infield dust -- does get real improvements? I think the promise again goes back to a question of trust. But we are already some four years from when it was first enadvice anded -- envisaged and very little has been  And if it is to be the case that the review goes ahead. May I just draw attention to wurnings I welcome the opportunity to meet with the Secretary of State, but I have questions I would like to put on the Fleadh. Is the department, -- floor, is the department aware of the growing health inequality s that have grown. The population is so far removed from what was stated in the original assessment by another 000 in the population. And  if we go back to what the scrutiny panel of 2009 said will what health look like in five years  well we are four years on and it doesn't look very different. I will give way. Listening carefully, I wonder has he detected whether he feels that he is pushes on an open door or a closed door? I know I'm sitting next to the member and I think she has been reading my notes, because actually I think that the time now with a new Secretary of State and with such interest now across the country, Chase Farm does not feel as if it is alone. There is a an opportunity to examine new  So I hope I'm pressing, pushing at an open door. Let me say I think when we are, whether it is cost or how we treat patients, we need to be bold and I think that we should be examining the impact of issues such as telehealth care on our acute centres. These are things that will not just drive cost, but better health care. Can they have an impact on whether we can retain more services at our acute centre and have more people treated in the primary sector? I have to say the Lewisham solution is actually something that I think my constituents look on almost with  We should be able to at least guarantee to our constituents that, well bear with me, let me bear with ..

He and I have something in common. He said he had been let down by the new Secretary of State after 2010. Well sadly, I have to say my constituents and I and my neighbour the member for Ilford north, who can't be here today, but asked me to mention he has been in committee, I also felt let down, because a decision was taken. We had six members of Parliament and in fact eight members of Parliament, koss  campaigning to save the Accident and Emergency at King George Hospital. But the government announced that after the previous decision and I will give way in a  they announced they were going to go ahead with the recommendation to close the Accident and Emergency and the ma tern Tait King George hospital. Well maternity births will end at the end of March in my constituency. And we will no longer have gin born  unless they're in the -- have children born in Ilford, unless they're in the back of taxis. I want to concentrate on the Accident and Emergency. This afternoon a risk summit is being held between Barking and Red bridge universities trust and the commissioners to consider the implications of the damning care quality commission inspection which is one of a series of inspections of the Queens Hospital, which was published on 30th January, last  That report said that among other things, the Accident and Emergency department has not met most of the natural quality indicators as a result of extensive delays in the care of patients. 5% of patients who need to be admitted to the hospital are waiting for more than eleven hours in the  The trust should be ail aiming to transfer 95% of patients who have been admitted to ward within four hours of their arrival. But they are waiting many of them much longer than four hours and 5% for 11 hours. That was an inspection in December. It also said that there the is poor care for patients in the majors area and the environment is unsuitable for patients to be nursed for long periods of time, because of lack of privacy and dignity, no washing facilities no, storage space and no bedside tables. And I would go on. There are complaints about the other services and facilities in the Accident and Emergency at Queens Hospital. Now, Queens is a new PFI-built hospital designed to 000 admissions. Last year, 000. It is in a joint trust with King George Hospital in  which has a lower number of  but the proposal was and the Secretary of State and his then health minister said that in about two years, from 2011, October, there was an intention to close the Accident and Emergency at King George and the patients would have to go to the Accident and Emergency at the already over pressed and stressed Keynes Hospital. -- Queens  That policy was always  It was always foolish. And we fought against it from the first proposals in 2006, the misnamed fit for the future proposals and we fought against it right the way through in unity, myself and neighbouring MPs, cross party, under the last Government, and we managed to get a halt to the implementation for a reconsideration and review, but sadly this government has given the go ahead to close the Accident and Emergency at King George Hospital.  He is right about the  We had healthy hospitals which was the last thing that it sought to gain. May I remind him that we have another thing in  That is that the merry-go- round of chief Executives, my former chief Executive to your hospital's Chief Executive eight -- and it worries me that the the administrators are in control. I don't blame the new Chief Executives at the trust for the currentation. She has not been there long enough. There are a number of predecessors who were party to this and I also blame Ruth Carnell and the people in London regional NHS who were behind the original proposals and they and Heather Mullin and the others in the NHS in London have determined for six years, seven year, to close the Accident and Emergency at King  regardless of the petition, regardless of the protests and the fact that the public in the rigged consultation even their own rigged consultation, rejected it. Yet they're going ahead. I will give  I am Graham on his point about the malign influence of NHS London. -- I am grateful.

In a report published yesterday by Robert  he said in paragraph 1.25 that MPs are accountable to their electorate but not necessarily experts in health care and certainly not regulators. They might need to consider how to increase their sensitivity with regard to the detection of local problems in health care. I am not sure how many members of parliament Robert Francis QC spoke to in writing that report. I suspect every member of parliament seeks to be a champion for the local hospital and for the NHS in their  I have left instructions that my body should be given to the Oxbridge university anatomy department for various reasons.

We need to have some national standards for that so we can all be confident we are comparing like with like. We can therefore be confident in the protocols which the ambulance service have, when they are taking a major road accidents, that people generally know what service they can expect from the Accident and Emergency service in Bambury, when it is more appropriate to be directed to the major trauma unit at the J Art in Oxford and indeed,  when they should not be bothering the Accident and Emergency department at all but should be going and seeing their own GP because all too often, people tend to treat the Accident and Emergency as an art a virus GP. -- R de Falla's. -- out of hours. This is a continuous change. The General Hospital at which my mother and sister were treated has long since closed. The General Hospital at which my father was a consultant has merged with another.

On the other  we have a much older  many with age-related dementia issues, who need to stay in hospital much longer. We are having to reconcile these distinct areas of medicine in one hospital. We have to recognise those changes and recognise, therefore, that medicine will not stay and service provision will not stay absolutely  These are not single models that we can apply throughout. We need to have some integrity and honesty about what services we are providing and Wear. We must acknowledge it is not always in the best interests of patients to think that one stand-alone hospital can provide every single service to every single patient. It does not,  and it is not in the patient's best safety. All of us will fight tenaciously to ensure the National Health Service continues to provide the very best for our patients. The Mid Staffordshire report yesterday was a wake-up call for us all that whilst we all love our NHS and think of it as representing our national cohesion as a society, it is something with challenges of which we all have to be part of and  I joined this debate as someone else who's A&amp;E is targeted  My local NHS said they need to reconfigure services because they have to deliver £370 million of savings each year, a reduction of around 24%, or how much it cost to keep the hospital  They set up a programme which was called better services, better value, to decide which hospital should lose its A&amp;E, despite the fact that across south- west London the number of people going to A&amp;E is going up 20%, and the birth rate continues to rise.  the bad news came that it would be my local hospital but would lose our A&amp;E, maternity, I  children's unit, we know unit and 390 in-patient beds.

The NHS admits it must save 375 million in my part of London alone. The UK statistics of the rot has made it clear the Prime Minister has broken his electoral pledge. Demand for A&amp;E is up, the birthrate is up. Instead of focusing on improving  this government has focused on top and reorganisation. If St Helier goes the way of Lewisham or worse and loses its A&amp;E and other services, my constituents will be angry. They know this will not work and want to hear today that it will be stopped. I sympathise with the problems that have been described by the member. It seems a long time since NHS in north London first proposed their healthier future programme. I put on record my concern that they would have a serious and negative impact on my constituents. Downgrading the four A&amp;E departments closest to them is completely disproportionate and will leave that he built of Ealing and Acton in the middle of an We have had rallies, marches sh petitions and pages of coverage in the local and national press. Now, I am not a natural marcher. But I did attend the rally on Ealing  along with local Conservatives. We felt the most constructive use of our time would be to encourage as many people as possible to fill in the consultation document. We offered guide Ann on how to navigate the lengthy set of questions. We helped about 600 people register their views A large contribution in an area that returned the highest number of responses to the consultation process. Almost entirely opposed I should say, to the plans. Something that demonstrates the level of worry there is in Ealing and Acton. I will give way. Yes, indeed, despite the biased questionnaire, efforts were made to fill in that questionnaire and a few thousand  So however 80,000 people filled in petitions that were ignored and the... Only the fixed questionnaires taken into consideration as a result. I think that a petition of that size is not something you can easily ignore, but it is worth making the point as we did when we encouraged to take time out for this consultation, although it was time consuming, but legally I suspect the authority is only obliged to register those who  That is something we did try to point out. Beyond this, my role has been to make my objections and those of my constituencies known and understood to as wide an audience as possible in Government. After meeting with the previous  I met the new ministerial team and the health Secretary. I followed this up with a meeting with the Prime Minister, where I left him in no doubt this issue is of the utmost importance and we all believe that it must be reviewed if the plans are to be taken forward. None of us can believe this is anything other than reckless. We wonder how Accident and Emergency will cope with the extra pressure. I point out that the extra travel time to Accident and Emergencys further afield would be  And Prime Minister -- the Prime Minister listened and asked questions and said he would discuss this with health ministers. Much of our campaigning has focused on highlighting the way NHS North West London has chose on the present the proposals, without adequately explaining how anything of this I going to work.

Clearly we need to encourage more people to sign up to local GPs, rather than depending on A mpd Es, but you just continue close the A&amp;E and expect people to cope.

Understandably people have an emotional attachment to their local hospitals and they need to be persuaded of the case for change. Given the health reforms will put GPs in charge, why aren't we waiting to see what decisions they think would be  rather than pushing these decision through now? The whole approach has been too rushed and local GPs have hardly been queuing up to support the proposals. The impression that my constituents have been left with is that the consultation was little more than an attempt to channel their views towards the preferred option in which what -- what was a box-tick  There are too many questions left unanswered. For all these reasons, I can only hope that if the decision by NHS North West London in February is to proceed as  then the Secretary of State will ensure it is reviewed in its entirety. My constituents are deeply concerned. Gareth Thomas. I enjoin joyed the speech of the the honourable lady for Ealing. And I share much of her sentiments. But if she will forgive me for saying what I thought was missing was a sense of regional context in this  And any national context. Because despite the pretence of a national review which my honourable friend for Ealing allow loud --  -- alluded to, this is obviously Government policy. Matthew Cook who advised the Department of Health spoke to NHS North West London supporting their plans to close four of our nine A&amp;E departments and was quoted as saying those plans were in line with national Government policy. I remember from the twen ten general election the Conservative Party manifesto promising to stop the closure of accident and emergency departments. I think the Prime Minister insisted there would be a moratorium to stop further closures. If I remember rightly, in London the Prime Minister visited during the general election Chase Farm Accident and Emergency department and also Queen Mary accident and emergency department in Sidcup. Promising to stop the closure. Insterbgsd both Chase Farm and Queen Mary's have either closed or are planned for closure. My honourable friend has made ref reps to planned closure of -- reference to planned closure at St George's hospital and another hospital. We have heard of the scandal of events in Lewisham where, doctors don't support closure of the Accident and  but it is still going to  I thought the whole reason behind the NHS act was to give doctors control over service  That is clearly -- that's clearly gone out of the window now. I am grateful to my honourable friend for giving way. He mentioned the hospitals where the Prime Minister visited before the  And promised to retain Accident and Emergency, in 2007 the Prime Minister said he would get into a bare knuckle fight over the future of Llew sham hospital. Does he agree on the part of the Government their policy does seem something hypocritical.Well it seems to be, there seems to be little obvious sign of any bare knuckle fights by the Prime Minister to stop the closure of Lewisham or the other eight Accident and Emergency departments that are set for closure in London. I want to use the remaining time in is in speech to concentrate on the plans at North West London. As the honourable lady who spoke before me  there are plans to shut  Charing Cross, Hammersmith and central Middlesex Accident and  My constituency is served by Northwick Park. My constituents are worried as to the pressure on their Accident and Emergency department. That will result from the closure of these four other departments in the area and where all the extra people turn up needing treatment to use Northwick Park's Accident and Emergency department. Teams in North west listened have noted the strategy assumes that thousands of people can be persuaded not to go to Accident and Emergency. But instead to use their GPs and other community services. I have to say that I have a little scepticism that this is going to work. Not least because the numbers using Northwick Park Hospital Accident and Emergency department are already significantly greater than they were before the 2010 general  One of the elements of the strategy to stop the impossibility of patients shifting to Northwick Park, not getting the services they need, is to use community services. So the decision to downgrade the Alexandra clinic, that was a walk in service opened 365 days a year in the South harrow part of my constituency to just Saturday and Sunday opening, 9am  It has throd more use of Northwick Park hospital Accident and Emergency department. As the number of doctors have said. I will give way in a second. The destoigs close that clinic supported by the Conservative Party in Harrow, they wanted it to close. It seeps to be -- it seems to be surprising given the appetite for community services to solve a problem of lots of people going to Northwick Park. Will give way. Actually in context, reading Hansard, both governments have in the past supported reconfiguration of the basis that you're Faulk about of more people being served in the community. This a probably not a bad thing. My issue is that it is not a question of having the infrastructure and the buildings and the clinical staff vairblgs it is a matter of --  it is employing people to have a cultural change and you can't do that easily and quickly between generations. While some may  my concern is that they're not taking the people with them. On that specific point, I agree with the honourable gentleman. What peoples different I have to say about the context that we are now debating is the sheer scale of the number of departments that are envisaged for closure. But if the honourable gentleman and others will forgive me and let me return to the clinic that helped divert people from using the Accident and Emergency department at Northwick  I do urge the new Harrow clinical commissioning group to either re-open the clinic as a proper walk in service, or to find an alternative site for such a  to reduce the pressure on Northwick Park. The last figures that I saw showed that in less than 12 months from April 2011 to February 2012, the numbers waiting more than four hours at Northwick Park and central Middlesex hospitals Accident and Emergency We need a clinical strategy that has the confidence of doctors to really drive down pressure on A&amp;E apartments in the future. Already, too many people in London have had to wait in ambulances for longer than 30 minutes. 42,000 people in  a rise of almost 50% on the previous year. 10,000 people had to wait more than 45 minutes to get into the A&amp;E departments. As clear as my honourable friend, the Member  has pointed out, the Prime Minister has broken his promise to protect NHS spending. It is clear that the NHS in London is under unprecedented pressure because of the party opposite's squeeze on NHS funding. A Prime Minister who promised to stop closures is allowing nine to go ahead across London, and once again, that old adage is been proved true. The same of Conservatives. You can't trust the Conservatives with the NHS. Extremely grateful to the honourable gentleman for his contribution. The next speaker has a limit of six minutes. Thank you very much. Six minutes seems like an eternity. My speech  a number of colleagues kindly commented positively on it, and this one will be much less  I apologise at the outset. I will be striking a different tone to many of the people who have spoken in this debate. The honourable lady mentioned the Better Services Better Value review which is being commissioned across South West London. To quote from the introduction to that review, health services in South there -- in London are not sustainable in their current condition. No change is not an option. The right number of points which were made in the  relevant to A&amp;E department in particular. They looked at me number of full-time equivalent emergency medicine consultants in each of the four A&amp;E departments, and they compared that with the recommended minimum number to achieve cover for 16 hours a day, seven days a week, which is the recommended level. For Croydon, that would mean 16 consultants, and we have a 4.9. St Helier should  but have 4.5. Kingston should have 16, but have 10. Since George's should have 16th, -- should have 21, but have 16th. So we do not have anything like the recommended minimum level of consultant cover. Data shows that  the probability of dying as a result of the emergency conditions is significantly higher if the admission is at the weekend, because of the low level of consultant cover. Each year, there 000 deaths following emergency admissions to London's  They would be a minimum of 500 fewer deaths per year if the weekend mortality rates were the same as the week day mortality  Canon the honourable gentleman tell me how he knows that those mortality rates he quotes are down to less consultant cover at weekends and not, for example, a sicker population entering A&amp;E departments over the weekend? The honest answer, I don't know. By relying on the report, which suggests that 500 is the figure which is due to the timing of the  We could argue about the  but I hope that you will agree that having fewer consultant on the weekend imposes some level  The Welsh College of Surgeons States -- the Royal College of Surgeons states that a surgeons to perform a high volume of procedures have better medical  The preferred population size for a hospital providing a full range of facilities for both elected and emergency surgery cases would be 450,000 to 500,000. We have a large number of hospitals in London with A&amp;E departments. They don't have the recommended level of full-time equivalent consultants to provide the best medical outcomes. Every single member of this House is going to defend their local  That is where their constituents go for treatment. If I was in the honourable lady's  I would be making .. I will give way to my honourable friend. I thank my honourable friend for giving way. The problem we have in North London is that Chase Farm is serving a growing population, so it is not out of an emergent -- emotional attachment that I want to keep it  It is as a result of the fact that we have a population which is due to grow by another 40,000 people over the next few years. The honourable gentleman has put his case for his hospital very strongly. I do not know the detail there and there would not like to comment. I will make time for the honourable lady to come in, but I want to advance my argument a little bit. There is a balance here. That is the point I'm trying to make in my  Constituents want to be able to access facilities at a local hospital for their own point  but also if they have an extended stay so that friends and relatives can come to see them. There is a balance between convenience and quality of  I think the honourable gentleman earlier was commenting, somebody in a serious accident he was able to go to a hospital with will be specialist expertise behind  there is a different balance that has to be struck. I want to mention another couple of points briefly in relation to improving the quality of care, which was also touched on in the Better Services Better Value review. What was he in relation to the European Working Time Directive. The review says, the implementation of the directive has resulted in shorter sessions of work with complex rotas and more frequent handover is, resulting in difficulties maintaining care which has implications for patient safety. There is also some powerful findings in the review in relation to the four our target which the previous Government reduced for laudable reasons in trying to monitor the level of care people were getting. The data for South West London shows that the A&amp;E spike between 245 and 260 minutes in all South West London acute trusts suggests that internal standards are relying on the four hours' rather than other quality  There are a range of issues in relation to A&amp;E departments in South West London. I want to mention Lewisham briefly. 90,000 people turned up at St Helier's A&amp;E  26% of those were admitted to a bed. The idea that we can be condescending to 90,000 people and tell them that they have just turned up in the wrong place is completely untenable. They are making an entirely rational decision by going to A&amp;E because there is nowhere else to go. The GP out-of-hours service is woeful and the standards are poor. If they are not alternatives, people will continue to go to A&amp;E, whatever he says or does. I am grateful to the honourable lady for her point. I was going to come on to her point. She said better services better but you talked about the 60% figure. She was unintentionally misleading  because the report specifically rejects that. They conducted a local study in South West London and found that 40% of all activity was coded as minor. 40% of patients were discharged with no follow-up treatment  Their conclusion was that they could be dealt within an emergency care centre which could be attached to the A&amp;E departments. I want to end by making one brief point about Lewisham. I listened with great sympathy to the arguments that the honourable lady  I have constituents to work at Lewisham Hospital and feel very angry about what has happened there. I will make one., which is we do have a National Health Service, and that means that when things go wrong in a neighbouring area, things go wrong in that area. But the honourable gentleman was wrong to state that this has only started under this Government. In the past in my area of London, things have gone wrong in other areas and my  That does not mean what is happening is right, but I am saying it is not fair to say this is a new  I want to end, Mr  by making this point. Honourable members in this debate have made a powerful arguments for their local hospitals. I want to say there is a balance between convenience of locality and making sure we have sufficient acute cover. I completely understand the honourable lady's point in relation to St Helier, but I say there is a solution which can get us to the level of consultant cover in our hospitals which is the recommended  and I continue to fight for that. Can I say to the Minister in her seat that I have sat where she is  12 years ago when I was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for  I had responsibility for A&amp;E services in particular. I want to impress on her that she does have power to respond to what has been said in the House today. All members will understand that the NHS does not stand still. The confederation's are necessary and changes are necessary. I was born in a constituency that had a wonderful hospital called the Prince of Wales, and it no longer  In the Roehampton part of  there was a hospital. It no longer exists. Things do change, and in London, we have seen changes to stroke services, and it is possible that if you were unfortunate enough to have a stroke, it may well be the case that you in that ambulance drive past a hospital to get to another hospital as a centre of excellence, and that was a good -- confederation that was done with great consensus across London. I pay tribute to the chair of the Primary Care Trust in Haringey who was leading at  I say to the Minister at this point in time, what she has her across the House Sirte, there are deep concerns in London, and there are changes proposed in every single area of our capital city. There are deep concerns about King George's in the East, real concerns raised about Lewisham in the South, and nobody can understand why Lewisham should pay for problems in an adjoining area in the way that is currently proposed. We raised concerns about problems in the  and that will come quickly to the problems in Whittington. We have heard about Chase Farm, and real pressures deep into the South which have been raised by my honourable friend in St Helier. And  there are concerns in the West of London in Ealing. That is unprecedented. I thank my friend for giving way. Does he accept that one of the problems is that the population of London is rising, health inequality and demands are rising amongst poorer people, and whilst I can understand all the arguments we are putting forward about the community, the reality is that if you close hospitals, there are many desperately ill and poor people who will not be served. My honourable friend makes the point  The demographics of  let's look at the Meyer's  has estimated London's population to be 7.8 million. The census later showed us that it was 7 -- 8.17 million at  The London plan believed that the population would break 8.5 million in 2027. We now believe that it will exceed this in 2016.  there will be 9.5 million people living in our capital city, and the area is marked for growth - - the areas marked for growth are the upper Lee Valley, Chase Farm, the Metropolitan Line corridor with nine A&amp;E Mark -- units turning into  the South East of London, expected to grow, weighed Lewisham  That is 9.5 million people using services that the Health Secretary is currently shooting down.

Londoners will be very concerned indeed that of  the structure, the discussion of this debate, the lack of consultation, as we heard put so well by my honourable friend, is taking place in the way that it is at this time. And I might say, I was staggered to hear about proposed changes to the Whittington  in the Camden New Journal. I had a meeting with other members of parliament with the chair and de chief executive in November, and we found out that a third of the hospital was to be sold off, that they were to be totally reliant on community services, at least a 500  and the people of north London where to again have to fight to retain the hospital that they  A hospital in which I and my two sons were born.

I asked her to act and put to an end this disarray that we're now seeing across London. I would talk about changes to Trafford Hospital A&amp;E. Over the years it has experienced financial and management problems, last year was absorbed into the Central Manchester Foundation Trust. We all expected there would be a reconfiguration of services, and  following a period of public consultation on the new health deal for Trafford, NHS Greater Manchester announced its intention to proceed with a plan to downgraded the A&amp;E to an urgent  and in due course to a nurse led a minor injuries unit alongside other changes to services. I suspect these changes will now be referred to the secretary of state. Nobody in Trafford is supposed to change that can improve clinical  and major trauma cases are already diverted away. Serious stroke and cardiac cases go to centres of excellence at Salford  University Hospital South Manchester and Manchester Royal  That approach is widely understood and accepted by local  Plans to develop a model of local integrated care are popular and it is recognised they could help keep people out of hospital for longer. But there are consequences, both from the reconsideration so that have already taken place, and a half of the Trafford resident now attend a different A&amp;E. Partly because local people are choosing to attend to  nearby hospitals which are for the greater convenience, or the kind of care they want, and it is widely believed that ambulances will not take you to Trafford General unless you specifically instructs them to, and partly because all this downward spiral is reinforcing public behaviour so they are increasingly less likely to go to Trafford General. So they are a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are real concerns about capacity at neighbouring hospitals. My honourable friend has been raising concerns since we first knew about these proposals last  about capacity at University Hospital South Manchester Wythenshawe. The A&amp;E there is already coping with admissions tens of thousands above 000 it was originally designed for. It cannot absorb any more patience of from Trafford. Commissioners assure me we are getting progress on integrated care but it is pretty well invisible that we are making that progress as far as local people are concerned.

There are concerns about the capacity of north-west ambulance service.

All this is taking place against a backdrop of wider reconfiguration of services right across Greater  Last year, a writer in the middle of consultation we hurled about a major -- we heard about a major new plan, and if as is likely the planned lead to further closures and reductions of A&amp;Es in Manchester as a whole, their ongoing capacity questions.

Clinical safety is of paramount  But there is a clear consensus that there was a significant safety issue relating to A&amp;E in Hartlepool.

No community does. It could be made closer and more convenient to where people live, we have had one minor injuries centre built in the very heart of the town  and it should be more easily accessible to a greater number of the town's operation. These are welcome steps. There was a debate in September 2010, and I said I stand by it, moving more serious cases to North Tees Hospital is unwelcome as it is detrimental to my constituents. My area has seen did bitter disputes for the best part of 20 years. There is a tension between the views of professionals who are best placed to consider the safest and was clinically effective means of providing a service. That might be in specialist centres. On the other  the general public, who will be the recipients, beneficiaries of that service and who are going to  They may often disagree with the means and very often the location of those services. Successive governments over two or three decades have failed to recognise -- reconcile that tension. The full test of reconfiguration that is often bandied about, regarding the reconfiguration, it is a fallacy. It is an understatement to say that Hartlepool would have preferred to maintain our four A&amp;E service. They don't feel they have had a proper say in this matter.

My third point is to wear the patient  If the child bangs his or her head in Hartlepool tonight, where should the parents take them? Previously it was a reasonably sensible choice. Now the parent is confronted with a choice of perhaps A&amp;E in North Tees, maybe it an urgent care centre, or the University Hospital of Hartlepool. The new arrangement is more complex and fragmented. If you have greater complexity and fragmentation, you have greater risk. 18 months after the A&amp;E closure, the system is bedding down. I'm not convinced that the risk is being adequately  There is inadequate communication and subsequent misdiagnosis. That has caused obvious and understandable alarm for my constituents. My 4th point is the pressing and persistent need to link reconfiguration of health services with transport policy. It just isn't there at the moment. How on earth is my constituents able to travel to North Tees, some 30 miles away? North Tees Hospital is a long way from any of my constituents. It is difficult to get to, in Hartlepool we have no carte ownership rates -- car ownership. Bus services are almost non-  I would have hoped that the government would not want the public to rely solely on ambulance  So any reconfiguration of services requires transport and accessibility at its very heart and at the moment, transport policy is merely being paid lip service. My final point is to do with the wider reconfiguration of health services north of the teeth. As it a day  much of the decision to close Hartlepool A&amp;E was based on immediate safety grounds. It is also fair to see this in that context of the momentum programme, designed to move the health services out of the hospital setting and into the community. The  it indeed build a gap opening of a new hospital designed to incorporate and serve the acute health needs of the local  The original plans and the first patients admitted by 2014, however do present government but true public funding for this hospital and despite a series of announcements from the Foundation  no alternative trust of funding has been approved. We don't appear to be any further forward. So there are two procedures running out of power. We have the momentum programme and the funding programme for the new hospital, now three years out of date with no concrete indication that private funding is on the table. Services have been moved without any real clarification as to the end game and my real fear is that my constituents will have the worst of all possible worlds.

I recall in the 1970s debates about whether Chase Farm should be closed. There has been an agenda, as indeed my colleagues will recognise, they are agendas all over the country which live on past directors and new trusts and new considerations, when there is always an aspiration for somebody to close something and centralise something on something  If you think that policy is robust within the House of Commons, you want to try NHS policy --  It is far more robust and far nastier than anything we experience it. I congratulate the member who opened the debate on getting the debate, because it is quite out rages what is going on across London. I ask the House to consider what my friends and Member for Tottenham said. London has a population which is rising quickly, with greater levels of health  greater levels of  and a fast rising number of daytime people in London three commuting to work or to cultural and sporting events or just passing through the capital city. The population of central number -- Central London goes up phenomenally during the day. If we start closing A&amp;E departments and saying that everything should go out into the community instead, the hospitals could be this reduced and closed, we are making the future very dangerous for our communities. The Whittington hospital is in my constituency. Anything I say about it is not a criticism of the existence of the hospital or the wonderful staff at aye Hospital. It is in support of them and everything that they do. We discovered three years ago that the A&amp;E department was due to be closed, and to there were denials all over  I say to the Member for  be sceptical, very  when you are told an A&amp;E department is and closing, because it probably is in a plan somewhere that is G2 make it close in the  -- that is due to make it close in the future. We had a bizarre rally in the election in 2010 when several members all got on a platform pledge in the future of the A&amp;E department of the Whittington Hospital, and it was duly saved at that time. But time moves on and the hospital wants to become a trust, and it therefore starts putting together a financial  which the Member for Tottenham referred to, which involves the sale of a quarter of  £17 million to be made  and also the loss of 500 jobs and the reduction of the number of beds in Whittington to  about half what it would have been five years ago. We need to ask  is an A&amp;E department with a hospital of only 177 beds  is it viable? Is this not some plan to actually removed the Whittington Hospital as an overall district general hospital with an A&amp;E department at some point in the future? The Camden New Journal and the Islington tribute reported on this last week, and congratulations to Tom for it and always to put that story together. -- all those who put that story  Many people in the local communities will be questioning the chief executive at a meeting and taking part in a big campaign to protect our hospital. We all face issues of healthcare. There is a consensus that will value the principles of the NHS, but if you allow A&amp;E departments to close, you end up with the health service becoming the service of last resort and the promotion of private medicine at the expense of the NHS. We will end up with a poorer society and greater health  That is in nobody's  so let's get control of it in a democratic way so we can control what goes on in the health service in our name. Thank you very much. Won this debate was first proposed to the Backbench Committee, it was a London debate, but colleagues from elsewhere in the country should not feel excluded. A lot of what is being tried out in London will soon be spreading to the rest of the country if they are not careful.  I had to be elsewhere  so I was not here for the beginning of the debate and I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak nonetheless. Let me not get involved in a hierarchy of misery. Many members have spoken passionately about their own  but I would say that both the A&amp;Es at the hospitals in my constituency are marked for  both at Hammersmith and at Charing Cross. Charing Cross has the best site in many ways, and some of the best facilities in North West London, and it is marked almost complete closure, so all 500 beds will go and the A&amp;E will go, and specialist services will go, leaving an urgent care centre, and other services left high and dry, such as cancer and the mental health services there.

Most hospitals in the area do not eat -- meet the four hour target. Ambulance care is less safe and effective than A&amp;E  Longer journey times need to  There is no evidence that when a good A&amp;E closes, most cases get dealt with better through centralisation. There is good data suggesting the opposite is true, as local A&amp;Es have the capability to select more specialised care, easing the pressure on large units, as well as being able to stabilise patients in the intermediate period. My constituents are being offered a second class service. There is no clear demarcation. The health service itself cannot tell us which conditions should go to an urgent care centre and we should go to an  The majority of my constituents will have a worse health service and VAT particularly applies to those who do not have access to private transport. Let's look briefly at the process we have  which has been utterly scandalous.

We have already heard about the phone in a consultation -- phoney consultation... A ensure the honourable gentleman was not suggesting he was like to run a house of Commons. Absolutely not. It was as part of the process of consultation that was gone through. I was not consulted, although it says so in the Documentation to. I cannot give way. That consultation was ignored. The body that is taking the decision has no stake in these matters whatsoever. The joint council will not exist. The bodies which have a stake in here, they will have too much influence, in my  and too much to gain personally in relation to that.

Members from all sides of the House make compelling cases and show the depth of feeling on this issue, and is one that cannot be approached easily without strong emotion. I know just how members feel about the issues facing our hospitals, and I'm sure the Minister does as well. The needs and best interests of patients are epicentre of the inspiration to create the NHS 60 years ago from the ashes of the Second World War.

Where at the closure is motivated purely by financial reasons, where a decision is taken in an absence of consultation, this is simply a cut the services hidden beneath the label of reconfiguration and this is not acceptable.

Ensuring the right provision of healthcare services can only be done for by speaking with patients and commissions. This is why it is crucial that consultation is undertaken at every level.

He  "let me refer again to one of the things that may need to change in our political debate.

In  I pay tribute to the comments of my right honourable  the member for Newark, and  and for Croydon North, and the speeches they made.
