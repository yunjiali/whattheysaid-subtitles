Questions to the Secretary of State  Number one, Mr Speaker.  we are reviewing the incentives and earned privilege scheme to ensure the public can be confident any privileges and in prison are going through hard work and good behaviour. We want this to be a comprehensive review and findings will be available. I can tell my honourable friend that the situation where some prisoners have at first to Sky TV channels, which many of our constituents cannot  will not be allowed to continue. I congratulate my it honourable friend for placing mentoring at the centre of prisoner rehabilitation. My constituent is running a scheme called belief in change, which is currently under threat through withdrawal of funding. I wonder whether my honourable friend would meet with myself and Mary Stevenson to see if there is anything we can do to assist the project. I am very happy to meet. He will be pleased to learn that the system we have in mind for dealing with Rehabilitation of offenders will reward those who have good ideas, ideas that work in driving down the reoffending rate. We want to see more mentoring because we believe that is effective. We look forward to hearing about it. Last month, the Secretary of State announced the closure of seven prisons. When will the replacement prison, referred to in the same statement, the constructive? The Honourable Gentleman knows that what we announce was to investigate the feasibility of a large prison. We also announce that we will build wealth hundred places at prisons that already exist. We will look carefully at all proposals for suitable sites for a new prison. One possibility is a site in North  which is councillors are keen we should consider carefully. In widening the capacity for work, what progress has he made in getting solutions on to the Government's preferred supplier list? My honourable friend will know that we are keen to look not just at direct contract from government work, but also other  We want to make sure there is a balance to ensure that 131 solutions are not closing out. Jobs which could be provided for British firms elsewhere, but we will want to make sure they have maximum opportunities to pursue jobs within prison that will help prisoners learn skills, hard skills and soft  An agenda he was successful in pursuing as my predecessor.  Mr Speaker. Much was made at the weekend of the Government's announcement on the regime imprisons about gay inmates being able to share cells. As far as I am aware, that is already not  so can he informed the House how many gay inmates have been sharing cells with their partners or is this another evidence for the announcements designed to chase headlines? The point that my right friend was  which I would be surprised if she disagreed with, is that it is clearly not appropriate for someone to live in that form of domestic arrangement whilst in  It is important that prisons are safe, Secure and decent, but it is equally important that regimes are properly austere and it is appropriate that the public should have confidence in the way in which people act whilst in prison. I think the minister makes my point  In that they don't know and this clearly was about headline. While the Secretary of State has been fretting over the weekend about the pocket-money, trainers, overrules of inmates, he fails to keep the most dangerous criminals locked up at all. Indeterminate sentences help keep offenders inside until they are safe to  The Governor of rotten  Lyn Saunders, told the Guardian I think I am fairly liberal and my attitude, but I have not come across anybody serving in this prison who I didn't think should have an eye EPP, not one. Why did this Government's abolish him determinant sentences putting public safety at risk? I think the honourable lady knows  We have replaced by EPP sentences with indeterminate  We have also introduce mandatory life sentences for violent or sexual offence. These are entirely appropriate sentencing  I'm afraid the position with i p p's had become a disorganised and chaotic one. One we could not allowed to stand. I'm afraid it is another classic example of the previous government introducing something they did not think through properly. I have to say that I think the honourable lady is wrong to minimise the seriousness of making sure that the regime imprisoned commands public  If she believes the public take no interest in what happens to prisoners while they are there and a privilege they have, I think she is wrong. If she believes we should leave it as it is, she should say so. I don't know whether the minister wants an adjournment, but that answer is too long. Speed  Number two, Mr Speaker. Proposals in transforming justice consultation paper are designed to deliver a criminal justice system that punishes properly and supports offenders to get lives back on  We want rehabilitation services to tackle the root causes of offending and ensure they have the right package of support to turn lives around. We will announce further details ones we have considered the responses to the consultation. Lower risk property bubble -- profitable components are to be handed to the private sector so the government is putting public money into private pockets. Given the year by year decline in reoffending, why is the government intent on releasing a risky and costly upheaval into the existing system rather than investing to improve it? I think the first point to make is that we don't believe these proposals will be more expensive them what is currently there. We think they will save the taxpayer  We are proposing to bring  not just good ideas from the private sector, but also the voluntary sector so we can drive down reoffending rates. That is an argument about opening rehabilitation hope up to other  private and voluntary. That is an argument the last Labour government made him the passage of the offender Management Act. We are implementing their idea. I notice he was not persuaded on that occasion either. Can my honourable friend ensure that providers will tackle the root causes of reoffending and help offenders really turn their lives around by providing mentors and signposting into employment and training opportunities as well as mental health and addiction services?The thing my friend is  We really need to turn lives  There are reasons why somebody might be living a chaotic  He is right to focus on addiction and employment. One of the most effective ways of Rehabilitation is to get them into  We expect providers under the new system to do that. May I ask the Minister, with regard to community sentences, if an individual has not actually performed as he or she should, he will assess against the usual criteria or whether there has been an actionable breach? Will it be the end experience privateer or will it be a fully qualified probation officer, who will have no contact with individuals prior to that time? The straight answer is that a probation officer, public sector probation officer, will make a judgement as to whether a breach should be taken forward. There will be an obligation to supply information to them as to what has  but the judgment will be made by the probation officer. He needs to recognise that in many  a large number of interventions provided are carried out by the voluntary sector. It isn't right that currently probation officers do everything  The information between them and those who do is in general very good. Question three, Mr Speaker.The Ministry of Justice recently published a consultation paper trams porting a revolutionary way it him reforming we offenders. The consultation closes on 22nd February and we will announce further details of our proposals ones we consider responses. Under the Secretary of State's  services will be fragmented across a wide range of providers and rewarded through payment by results which will prevent public sector probation trusts some competing for their  so how will he ensure that a high levels of performance now provided by those probation trusts in protecting the public and reducing reoffending will be maintained? Let's be clear why we are doing  Reoffending rates have barely changed in 10 years and it is not true to say we are getting the kind of performance that she refers to. There is good work done in the probation service and the voluntary sector and also the private sector. My aim is to have a package of proposals that brings about the This undermines the way in which local bodies concerned with preventing crime can work together and undermines the ability of voluntary sector organisations to  There are two reasons. We do not believe that the expertise excess on a localised basis to procure payment by results in an ambitious way. Of course, many of the probation trust management teams are keen at being part of the contracted-out work  I hope to see them form a partnerships and take the service  Question 4 or.Mr Speaker, I have not met the Joint Committee on Human Rights since I became Secretary of State. I was due to attend this on 18th December last year but the meeting was postponed until February this year. Ford to  when we were debating their legal aid bill before he took over as Secretary of State, there was a commitment by his department to review the legal aid particularly in relation to immigration and asylum. They are now addressing this in relation to unaccompanied minors. Will he address that issue before he meets the committee and see whether we ought to amend this so that vulnerable people with immigration and asylum issues get the proper advice they need? I am happy to give that commitment and look at that before the evidence session.  It does seem to me that the government's process on reviewing the human rights legislation is somewhat slow. At a time when the practical implications are more urgent than  not least in relation of two gay marriage which we will debate  so I would ask the Secretary of State if he will speed up the process which I think everyone wants to see? As my honourable friend knows, I feel strongly that we need to make changes to the human rights framework. It is my belief that there is not a majority in the House for the changes and it will fall to a majority Conservative government in the future to change this. West and  We want the criminal justice system that to move faster and deliver justice sooner for vulnerable witnesses and victims. We are looking at how to tackle delays across the criminal justice system to improve efficiency. I want to thank the Minister. Of victims of this child sexual exploitation ba already traumatised by their experience and they face a gruelling cross-examination has been caught in the process of  Would he agree that justice for these vulnerable  not served by a lengthy adjournments, and that specialist training would help judges better balance the needs of victims and the accused in court proceedings? I fully understand and sympathise greatly with what the honourable lady has said and I do agree with her and that concerns can affect the willingness of a witness to participate in the criminal justice system and that is why a ministry of justice are embarking on a strategy to improve efficiency and effectiveness and that will love that the entire process from up to the completion of the case. I wrote to the honourable lady in relation it to a case in her own constituency and I hope she has received that. I am happy to meet with power to provide a further  Thank you. In relation to vulnerable and intimidated  does the Minister agree that the use of Justice and Criminal Justice Act provides that no corrective measures to support them vulnerable witnesses to give the best evidence possible? I think my honourable friend and makes a very good point. I would add that the special procedure measures that are available in the form of pre- trial familiarisation visits, support from Witness Service and separate entrances and exits and separate waiting areas and access to a live link can help to reduce the stress and the anxiety of going  We are considering what more we can do to improve support, including new technology to change the way that evidence is given. Thank you Mr Speaker. The Minister said recently that she believes the new victims Commissioner feels a wonderful opportunity to see victims that at the heart of the justice system. Is that why he will only do it ten days a month? His and the Minister guilty of failing of victims of crime?The victims commissioner is a very able and is able to mop the -- multi- task. We have had a number of meetings and they want to put victims and vulnerable witnesses at the heart of the criminal justice system where they belong and that is why we are prioritising are victims of serious crimes, we are prioritising victims that are persistently targeted and we are prioritising are the most vulnerable victims so that they get the support and care that they needed. Question a number at six please. 103,000 appeals are related to the work capability assessment were disposed of last  The estimated will cost associated with these was �23.5  In the previous financial  189,000 appeals were made.  He well knows from his previous responsibilities that many of those appeals are in related it to failures in the assessment. Figures I have tamed it showed that some people have to repeat this, including people with cancer, Parkinson's disease and other progressive conditions. They will be less cost to his department if we stop reassessing people who are not going to get better? That is a matter for the Department of work and pensions. It is my job to provide an appeal route. Before I left my previous job, I asked officials to change the way in which we reassess people so that there is a more sensible length of time of between appeal and  Thank you Mr Speaker. It does he agree that there would be more efficient for the entirety of government if decisions were made right the first time. They have not delivered that. When he speak to colleagues in the Department of work and pensions to try and ensure that the decision- making is correct in the first  My honourable friend will know that this was a matter of great concern to me. None of us benefit from getting decisions wrong and a huge amount of effort has been put into getting them  It is necessary to make sure that we provide a route for appeals, but I can assure him that a huge amount of effort was in it to try to get them right first time. Mr  We are considering a number of ways to make the best use of magistrates' courts including the option of increasing a magistrate bus sentencing powers. Our priority is to extend supervision to short sentence prisoners to ensure they were receive supervision on release. He has been undertaking a work experience on a farmyard! Kettering is fortunate to have an excellent bench of magistrates and the whole nation should be grateful for the tremendous unpaid work carried out 000 magistrates up and down  Is the Minister aware that �40 million could be saved in the criminal justice system if he were to undertake this simple revision of powers and justice would be better, cheaper and quicker and more local as a result? I share his high regard for magistrates in it Kettering and around the country. They are volunteers who do a very good job. I am aware of the Magistrates' Association's proposals and the costings and savings involved. They bear some scrutiny because they would clearly be other effects in terms of more people in prison, potentially in terms of more defendants electing for Crown Court  The main thing to do is to ensure that people do not reoffend and that is why we are concentrating on extending supervision of two short sentence  A constituent of mine, an elderly lady who is old and slightly infirm, she has been asked to do perform the third at jury service in which she has to take  Is there anything the Minister can do about this regarding of pensioners? I am confused as to why he is asking this question in relation it to magistrates' courts because there are not juries there. If more cases were heard in Crown courts, there would be more demand -- more demands for juries. I am not sure he is in accordance with the original question. I declare the interest that my wife is a magistrate and on occasion she comes home in tears of frustration because she is not given the powers to enable them to do the job in the way they wish to do it. When he seriously consider extending sentencing powers so that they can take some of the weight out of justice in the future? I am happy to tell my honourable friend that the queues in the Crown courts in particular are coming down. We will consider the proposal from the Magistrates' Association and others it to increase the maximum sentence  but this has to be put in connection with many other reforms that are necessary to improve the process of justice throughout the criminal justice  That sounded like a know what to that. In addition to that, we have that a third of indictable offences to balance were dealt with with cautions last year rather than coming to court. While cautioning a violent and dangerous criminals is being it dealt with outside court, and a minor offences are being sent to the Crown Court, does that not look incompetent? What does that the Minister have against magistrates and why is the treaty memo with such contempt?That is  I am considering a proposal made originally by my honourable  The use of cautions has come down considerably since the government of which he was a supporter was in power. Question at  8 please. Retaining the expertise in the community sector is important. We have announced funding to support voluntary sector groups to help them compete for  I am meeting with a number of groups to ensure they are as on board as possible. Thank you. I am grateful to the Secretary of  His recent statement on transforming rehabilitation has the potential to be hugely positive for the voluntary sector. It is crucial that charities can compete for contracts on a level playing field. What is the government doing it to ensure that charities are not at a disadvantage in competing for contracts? There are two points that I have made. I agree with his  The first point is that the cash flow element of the proposals will not be as tough as the work programme, part of the task is to pay for the requirements of the court and the cashflow situation will be different. I am also making sure that we engage the sector who complain that voluntary sector organisations can compete on that plane field and can when it. The Secretary of State will know that we privatise and contracted out hospital cleaning and it led to  we privatise school meals and it led to problems, why does he think that in relation to probation  such an important service that contracting-out will lead to a better end? If I am not mistaken, he was a Minister in the last government that introduced in the legislation that makes these changes possible, so they say one thing one day and one thing the next! Reoffending rates have barely changed in a decade despite extra money being spent and I want to bring them down. Our strategy for the prison estate is to replace accommodation with his old and inefficient with cheaper, modern capacity and we also have a rolling programme of maintenance which prioritise is a Investment across Last week my honourable friend it and I visited Stafford and heard from prisoners of the work done by Joe onemac Tomlinson on anxiety management and how it had changed their lives. Does my honourable friend agree that modernisation is about what goes on inside prisons rather than bricks-and-mortar? I certainly agree that what people do is as important as where they do it and congratulate those involved in the work he described. I do think that very often, what people are doing is that despite the environment with which -- within which they are working and where we can provide newer accommodation it will make it easier for people to do the good work on rehabilitation that we are both in favour of. Would the Minister agree that with eight or 900 prisoners per year in Wales going outside Wales, there is a need for prisons in North Wales. And that debate now would be better served by more discussion, more plans and a meeting to agree consensus on this? I am very grateful for support on the idea of a prison in north Wales. He may want to discuss that with that of the honourable friend he does not agree with him. It would be wise for everyone to consider carefully proposals that come  We have identified North Wales as a place where there is a strategic Mead so we will consider carefully any proposals made. Number 10, Mr Speaker. A survey of 1435 prisoners sentenced between one month and four years in 2005 and 2006 showed that 45% of prisoners reported having taken a class A drug in the four weeks before custody. No recent estimate has been made of the proportion of prisoners leaving prison with an addiction to a class A drug. I thank the Minister for that reply, but I might gently suggests that it would be worthwhile to have more recent estimates and address this question about the situation of offenders as they leave prisons. Has the Minister ruled out suspicions of conclusions by any prison staff in explaining why access to drugs in prison is so widespread?  we don't have the figures on a number of prisoners leaving prison with an addiction to a class A drug a, that this government is absolutely committed to stopping drugs entering prisons and getting prisoners of drugs for good. We cannot break the devastating cycle of drugs unless we deal with the issue of drugs in prison. Why doesn't the Government adopt the recommendations of the Home Affairs Select Committee which are simple - mandatory testing of prisoners when they enter prisons, mandatory testing when they come out of  That will give her all the figures she means an order to deal with this serious problem. Well, we feel investing in comprehensive testing may not be the best way to tackle the problem, but the Government welcomes the Home Affairs Select Committee report and we will of course give careful consideration to all of the findings and all of the recommendations. The minister will be aware that the prisoner in my constituency, the independent monitoring board has reported that 85% of the prison population is currently involved in the use of spice, and synthetic cannabis type drug. I am not convinced that the systems to combat drugs in a system is working. Is she? Our plans to transform rehabilitation will radically change the way we manage offenders and they will also provide much more effective support for offenders on release. Fewer prisoners are testing positive for drugs at any time since 1996, but there is still much more to do. That will involve working closely with the Department of Health and others to provide the best possible recovery services. I am confused by the complacent answers we have had. All the government are offering is warm words on this. They have no recent evidence and we all know, from our own experience, of one single prisoner in the whole of Britain that is free of illegal drugs. If the government has no evidence of people going in as shoplifters and coming out as heroin addicts, the rest of society does have that. Shouldn't they take a policy that is at least robust and realistic and look at the traffic between prison officers and prisoners on drugs? As a make clear, we are looking carefully at the report, but we also genuinely believe that our transforming rehabilitation plans will provide much better continuity of care and help get prisoners of drugs and the Long Term.  11, Mr Speaker. The offence only came into force on 1st September 1920 12, but early indications are that it is being enforced and reports suggest it is deterring squatters from occupying other people's homes. As a result of the 2012 legislation, there are indications that squatters are increasingly targeting commercial properties. Would my honourable friend tell the House what plans he has to evaluate the size of commercial squatting and what he will do to amend the law if necessary? I can assure my honourable friend that we are monitoring closely because there is the possibility of displacement squatting at going on. We are in the early stages of collecting  so if he has specific examples from his own constituency of squatters occupying mum residential buildings we will look at that carefully because squatting is a damaging a fence. Question number 12, Mr Speaker. With permission and I would like to group this question with question  The minister of justice have published evaluations of the effectiveness of community orders and custodial sentences in reducing  Reoffending rates are still far too high, which is why we set out our plans to transform rehabilitation. I thank the Minister for that reply. Whilst there has been a welcome fall in crime and anti-social  many victims still feel alienated by the justice system and its impenetrable sentencing  Will she speed up the move to restorative justice so that the victims can feel much more engaged and the community will benefit from the justice system? I think my honourable friend makes a very good point. We are wanting to mainstream restorative justice and we are working very hard with them restorative justice cancelled to make sure that we go forward in a controlled and sensible manner. Government pilots show that restorative justice programmes cause of 14% reduction in offending. What steps of the government taking to roll out schemes throughout the country more widely and well she give a specific plan to protect funding for projects like the Sycamore Tree Foundation in Cumbria? There is a framework and we are looking at capacity and quality. I am happy to write to the honourable member with full details. Would the Minister agree that we have too many people in prison? By the time they get in prison, not enough is done to turn them into good citizens and isn't there are plenty of evidence that effective treatment outside the prison in the community works? Can't we improve those services because a probation service is crucial in helping to make those effective. I think the honourable member makes  Obviously who goes to prison is a matter for the independent judiciary and prism is absolutely the right place for some  but I would agree with  for other offenders, credible community punitive sentences can be more appropriate. Has the Minister considered the effectiveness of short-term prison sentences for women? Not only in terms of reducing reoffending, but in terms of the destruction and damage caused to depend taught -- dependent children? Yes I have. I have considered this very carefully and visited a number of facilities. I was in a wonderful facility in Gloucester a couple of weeks ago. I am going to a facility in Reading on Thursday to look at exactly this. Community sentences must, however,  They can't be fluffy  They should have a punitive element and they should absolutely challenge the woman or the man to change his or her life. That is why the court will require every community order to have a punitive element. Number 13, Mr Speaker. We will always ensure there are sufficient prison places for offenders sentenced by the courts and we will do so increasingly in more modern accommodation. We Internet to be at least as many adult male prison places at the end of this Parliament as there were at its start. When considering any future extension of the prison estate, would my honourable friend consider the Isle of Sheppey as a suitable location?We will consider all reasonable bit. Right honourable friend knows we have looked into the feasibility of a new large  We have identified three parts of the country where we think there is a strong case, but we will look carefully at any reasonable bids. Of his department's plans to resurrect tighten prisons, the Economist said: It you can't keep a bad idea down. Wide the U-turn in Tory prison policy after four years? Let's remember who's bad idea it  We are not resurrecting it, we are talking about a prison that is economic it viable, a prison that will save the taxpayer money, but it may not and it almost certainly will not be exactly what they tighten prism was. There are many ways of doing this. We may have a number of smaller institutions on one site and still achieve the same economies of scale. No. 15, Mr Speaker. We are working hard across government to remove foreign national offenders. Last year, we removed more under prison will transfer agreements than the year  We have recently made our first transfer under the you PTA and signed a compulsory PTA with  The first time we have done so with a high-volume country. Have any agreements been reached with any countries recently?  Mr Speaker. We signed the agreement with Albania earlier on in January. Very recently indeed. We hope very much that we will start making returns under that agreement very shortly. As I said  it is important that these agreements are compulsory agreements wherever we can negotiate such so that prisoners do not have a choice about going back. Number 16, Mr Speaker. As set out in our recent engaged and exercise, our policy is to reduce the burden on public services of ill-founded judicial review whilst protecting access to  We are working with the judiciary to ensure we achieve this balance. Has the Secretary of State not seen liberties response to his consultation on judicial review which finds no statistic that it impedes growth or stifles  Why does the Secretary of State believe it is correct to remove rides from communities and vulnerable people just to find an excuse why this economy is not growing in five of the last nine quarters?The problem with judicial review is there are mushrooms beyond expectation. It started with a few hundred cases now more than 000 per year. They are often based on a PR exercise or an attempt to derail based on a technicality. It should be a genuine process to challenge authorities when it gets wrong, not an excuse to fly a kite. No. 17, Mr Speaker. The provision of feedback on reasons for tribunal decisions is a matter of the judiciary, however we actually putting new arrangements  The Court Service are now working with the deed of BP to evaluate finding so that decision- making can be improved wherever we can. I thank the Minister, but his successor as Employment Minister indicated at Select Committee that it was important that the reasons given by tribunals were expanded far beyond the drop-down menu which was previously introduced, so that we did not get the kind of opaque statements like courage and oral evidence as a reason for the appeal being upheld. Can the Secretary of State say that these will be much I think we have learned quite a lot from the many and of course the departments will discuss  Topical questions. Mr  since becoming Justice Secretary I have embarked on a programme it to boost public confidence in the justice system. We are consulting on rehabilitation and we will be considering reforms to youth justice. In the past, my department has undertaken consultations in some areas including legal aid. While the government will continue to want to hear the views of stakeholders and  they should no longer expect at 12 week it consultation. Instead in line with the principles, we will take a fresh let go across all areas as to how we consult. I was going to use this opportunity to follow up on my previous  but since I got a good  I will not bother. I think he has created a President! Mr  I only wish I would get a decent answer. He has been busy chasing headlines recently. Can I ask some specifics?

We have a good model for put -- Press and development in awkward. It is a site which has multiple of different blocks, first-class training facilities and is an excellent model for the future of the Prison Service. We are looking at a number of sites and hope to reach a decision in the next few  I want to open a new generation of prison as soon as  Four weeks ago, he announced that he was going to Oban and you are super prison in the near future and was going to undertake feasibility studies. Can he tell their House at how many current prisoners are gay and share prison cells with other gay people? I do not know how many people in prison are gay, Mr Speaker. I want to make sure that the regime in our prisons is appropriate, it has  commands the confidence of the public, provides an appropriate environment for rehabilitation and training and insurers we have a system in which everyone can have confidence. An increasing number of international companies are looking into the UK for our legal services. This trade creates of billions of pounds for  Could have a Minister tell us what plans there are two further promote British legal services abroad? Our legal firms and our legal education in establishments are a great assets of this country and the Ministry of Justice is working closely with the profession it to promote these wonderful services overseas and I am sure that my honourable friend would take a great joy in are looking at the disputes campaign which is a good example of recent fruitful activity. But he sighed coroner it takes almost twice as long as the national average causing anguish for families. This matter has been raised in many  why on earth giving him a  is the coroner is still in post and what steps will the Minister take to remove them? I am not going to give a detailed response in the chamber. I will discuss the issue with the honourable member. I take seriously any concern raised about the effectiveness of the judiciary. I will look at that issue for him. Will my right honourable friend outline what steps he is taking to look at the youth detention system? I intend to bring forward a consultation paper shortly on this. The challenge we have is that across this area we are detaining a small number of young people at a high cost and with an unacceptably high reoffending rate of 70% and I want to see if there is a better way of doing things to improve this and turn of their lives around. I met this morning with Bill  the chairman of a solicitors' Association. Despite what the Minister said earlier, I am assured that there has been a sharp increase in it cautions for very serious offences including his sexual offences and a violent  This is soft on criminals and very harsh on victims. When he meets with me and Bill Waddington to discuss this's I take very seriously the issue of cautions for serious offences and one of the first things I have done is to commission work on this issue. I will meet police officers about  I would caution the House to  If there is a caution  we would view this as unacceptable, but in some cases when the victim is unwilling to give evidence, it may be the only way of getting something on record about an offender. We must be What assessment has he made of the potential to reduce reoffending by providing it treatment in prisons for gambling addiction?We recognise that prisoners have a variety of causes to their offending and I think my honourable friend is right to highlight this. We want prisoners to have access to the necessary schemes in prison and through the gate to outside to deal with what every their issues may be and we will look carefully at what he says about gambling.Just when MPs from all parties are seeing growing demand on housing including as a consequence of the welfare and benefit changes, eight of the Shelter Housing Advice centres are scheduled to close. The centres are lifelines to those in housing need, often at a time of crisis. Will the Secretary of State agreed to meet with me and Members of Parliament of all political parties concerned and affected in their constituencies about how we support those in housing needs's we will always have a discussions with members about concerns they have in their constituency. I'm afraid that those on the other side of the House must understand that we are dealing with a financial crisis that we inherited from them up. That means we have to take tough decisions that they might not all  A magistrates' courts in Swindon will be making important decisions about the allocation of crime and family work. When he worked with me to ensure that the very long journeys to access justice do not become the norm and? I am happy to meet my honourable friend to talk about this. I am sure he will welcome of the work in the Court Service to produce alternative ways in which people can give evidence which precisely main that some unnecessary journeys and waiting times at courts can be There are 500,000 victims of sexual offences but only 500  Why does the Secretary of State think the number of sex offenders prosecuted is falling under this coalition government? We take in the whole issue seriously which is why one of our commitments is to expand the availability of rape crisis centres. I visited one of those in Devon and paid tribute to the work they are doing. We will do all we can to ensure that offenders are brought to trial and any ideas that come through this that work will be listened to. I would like to refer to the Justice Secretary proposals to reform the probation service. I have got a communication from the police and crime Commissioner for Welsher expressing concerns about the degree of consultation prior to this announcement and concern about the level of involvement that commissioners will have an a discussion they will have locally in providing these services? One of the things we are doing is consulting on the broad direction of travel so it does create an opportunity for crime commissioners to take part. We are listening. Most people accept that there is a need for change in a motor accident claims sector. He is the Minister satisfied that it new plans to raise the small claims limit from 000 to �5,000 will ensure that accident victims continued to find adequate independent local advice and access to justice? I think it  I think even at �5,000 there is a case for saying that the small claims court limit is it too  I want a situation where people have access to a proper legal process but the benefit of that court is that it is in part arbitration and it makes the process simpler for people who have been through a difficult time. Last month in Bradford, there was a man who was one of the last people to be locked up on an I p p. He is a dangerous paedophile who was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl and trying to add that at 12- year-old Beryl. He will not be released until he is considered  Under the new regime, people like him will be released whether they are safe to be released or not. How will that make my constituents feel safe? My honourable friend knows how I hate to disagree with  but I do think that he needs to recognise that what we are doing is replacing these measures with measures that are just as tough and a lot more effective and the truth is that if someone is convicted of offences of a very serious nature, then a judge has the option of passing the ultimate indeterminate sentence which is a life sentence if it is merited. We are taking measures to protect the public, we are replacing an ineffective sentencing at the regime with a better one. As the Minister progresses his plans for a probation services, what consultations has he had with the devolved administration, when did he last meet the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and was probation services on his agenda? I met him around ten days ago and I will meet him tomorrow and we will discuss it. Will the Secretary of State than firm and that the use of automatic early release would be entirely inappropriate for a convicted terrorists given the renewed threat they will pose to society and the amount of security and intelligence resources that will have to be devoted to monitoring them on  If that someone was to receive a sentence for an offence of terrorism, expectation would be that that would be extended were release would not be automatic. I hope that provides reassurance. Further to that question, no Minister recently confirmed that 12 a terrorist convicted under the Terrorism Act will be released from prison in this year. How will he ensure that the probation trusts are responsible for the supervision have the necessary resources's he knows that the arrangements made for offenders of that nature will be under an arrangement which will make sure that all the local authorities and other agencies responsible for those arrangements have the support they need and we will look carefully at what he says and make sure that that is the case. Magistrates' courts play a key role in the administration of justice in the UK but often at their operation can be chaotic and it is unclear when cases will be heard and they are hard to follow. Will the Department look at reorganising that so it is efficient and clear? I am at one with him on this.

I have been in touch with the Youth Justice Board about the decision to bring Ashfield youth offenders' prison into an adult prison. Mike concern is that offenders will now go up as far as Feltham.

I seek your guidance as to whether it is appropriate for a minister to refuse to meet honourable members to discuss a matter relating to important issues relating to their constituencies? It seems quite extraordinary that a minister has refused three times to meet with members of parliament he were elected and should be given respect.

I beg to move that Leith be given to bring him a bill to amend the building regulations 2010 to include regulations of load-bearing walls for connected purposes. On 26th July 2008, the lives of my constituents, Peter and leave the  were changed for ever. At the time they were living in a constituency of the member for Clwyd who I can see in the seat  Mrs Burgess was with her three-month-old daughter an 18 month old son and they had been to a local shop.

The 72 fought a long wall was built of nine Inch breeze blocks right next to the pavement. It felt pretty much in one piece under the weight of 26 tons of rubble which had been piled up behind it. This was not a typical garden wall, it was a large-scale engineering  Materials used to build the wall were not adequate for its  The war had not been an could properly into the ground. No measures had been taken to protect pedestrians walking along a pavement and it collapsed just moments after it had been back  The builder was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in October and he was given a two-year jail sentence.  justice has been done, but make should never have been killed in the first place because the wall should have been built  Mr Speaker, the pain and the anguish that Mr and Mrs Burgess have dealt with is unimaginable to all of us in this chamber. They have carried themselves with dignity and strength and now that they have achieved some justice, they are determined that no one else should go through what they have been through. That is why they set up a campaign in her honour. Seeking to license a domestic building trade in the UK and bring free-standing load-bearing walls within the code of building  Today's motion seeks to address one part of the campaign and I hope that you find favour on both sides of the house. Make it is not the only person to have been killed by a collapsing wall. Exact numbers are difficult to quantify, but a written parliamentary question that I asked last year reveals that over a ten-year period, there were on average over 1000 injuries caused by the partial collapse or collapse of exterior  That is 1000 injuries per  There are significant numbers of people injured every year, yet changes to regulations have not been forthcoming. Mr Speaker, I would quickly like to express my gratitude to the minister and on behalf of Mr and Mrs Burgess for meeting with us in December to discuss intricacies of the campaign. I'll would also like to thank him for the promises he was able to make and commitment to making local authorities are aware of current responsibilities in relation to danger structures. I believe more needs to be done. As things currently stand, retaining and load-bearing walls are not covered by regulations. There are centrally available guidelines about how a retaining wall should be built, but these are not always a deity. A consultation document published in January revealed that over 50% of small builders surveyed do not follow any form of official guidance for building walls. The  Mr Speaker, that you and I could go at this afternoon, watch a video on YouTube and then go out and erect a 5 ft-high wall, pile rubble behind it and there would be no obligation on us to seek official guidance, no requirement is consult with structural engineers and it would not be necessary for building control to inspect our work. In this case, despite 30 years experience, the builder chose to cut corners and build a wall without structural integrity Terry required to hold  If the builder had followed guidelines, she would still be alive today and that is the crux of the issue. The builder did not follow guidelines, but at no point did anyone check whether he had or had not. Had retaining walls been included in building regulations then the property owner would have had to submit plans to the local authority for approval. It would have had to indicate its  The design would have had to incorporate additional strengthening measures for it to carry weight and the work would have had to be expected before any earth was piled against it. Any building inspector would have instantly seemed that the proposals for this war were not up to scratch and it would be unlikely to support its own weight, let alone the weight of her built up behind it. Any building inspector would see that this war was not strong enough. No up would have been piled up behind the wall and the little girl would have been alive today.  Mr Collier thought he could get away with saving a few hundred pounds and a few hours'  as a result a young child  This motion would enable a build to bring retaining and load- bearing walls within building  I believe this to be a  straightforward proposal that other countries across the world have seen fit to legislate  In Australia, any retaining wall of one metre in height requires development approval. They have also been legislated for in a number of US states. In Colorado, any retaining wall over 3 ft high requires a site plan and a permit from county planning departments. In the Republic of Ireland where planning permission is required for retaining walls over a certain height depending on the local  Regulation is not without precedent in the UK either. The Hastings Council Act in 1988 says that no retaining wall should be erected otherwise in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the borough council. In the borough of Hastings and Hastings alone, by Act of  anyone wishing to erect a retaining wall over 1.5 metres in height must have their plans approved by the borough council. Whilst I can understand that local authorities may object because of the workload, the Hastings at is a poignant example of how simple and straightforward it would be for local authorities to practically administer such a scheme. Am totally supportive of the Government's red tape challenge, but this is a potentially life- saving measure that could, and I believe should, be adopted as soon  I am delighted by the huge number of honourable member who have chosen to leave this chamber for this motion. I hope they would join me in supporting this motion and urging the Minister to consider the merits of bringing retaining and load-bearing walls within the scope of building  Mr Speaker, I commend the Bill to the house.

A loving relationship and a mutual support throughout our lives. I believe this is something that should be embraced by more couples. The depth of feeling, love and commitment is no different between same-sex couples than opposite sex  This Bill enable society to recognise that commitment in the same way through marriage. Parliament should value people equally in the law and enabling same-sex couples to marry removes the current differentiation and distinction.

I welcome this Bill. Did she understand the disappointment of those who believe that the Church of England is not being given the choice according to other face to marry same-sex couples if they so choose? Far from being forced to marry same-sex  they are being forced not to marry them even have some elements would like to do so? I think she can get complete reassurance today that we are not in any way through this legislation at trying to treat the Church of England in any way differently. The end result that we will get for the churches will be exactly the same as other religious institutions. The difference is the fact that the Church of England and church in Wales have a different duties under  to marry people in their parishes and that the canon law is part of the law of this land. We do have to have a different measures in place to recognise those differences, but I can absolutely assure her that if either of those organisations chose to opt into equal marriage, then they would be able to do so according to the provisions in in  I would like to make some more progress. Mr Speaker, I think from the contributions we have  there is no doubt about are the fundamental importance of faith in this country today.

What greater example about the equality agenda could there be than Jesus Christ himself? He makes a powerful point and I think it shows that views on this matter differ not along party  not a long lines of religious membership to a particular institution, but a far more nuanced one and than that. If I could make a tiny bit of progress. Now four of the provisions in the  The Bell has three parts, it enables in part one of same-sex couples to marry in same sex couples and allows religious organisations to opt in a while protecting those that do not.

They are standard provisions including his secondary legislation.

These protections are carved on to the face of the bell and a on a foundation upon which they wrote -- the legislation is built. Thank you. Can she explained to the House why she is bringing forward this legislation now when it was not in the Queens Speech, has not been the subject of a green or White Paper when there are other things that the government promised to do, such as a married couple's tax allowance, it is the truth of this about low political calculation and detoxifying in the Tory brand rather than anything to do with principal? I have to say that we will have to disagree on S. We are doing in this very clearly as an important part of the way we can make the this country a fairer place to lead the. The measure was flanked at that in Arab agenda on quality in the election. We will work with our colleagues in Northern Ireland to ensure that we have recognition for English and Welsh same-sex marriages in the UK. I am grateful. She is talking about protections in the legislation. We had the case about Adrian Smith, who lost his job, spent a lot of money on legal fees and got a cut in his salary at after making a comment on a Facebook site. How will we protect the men are like him in the public sector up and I think the case that he is highlighting proves that individuals can express their individual beliefs. The court found in that individuals favour. I think employers up and down the country should take clear note of that. I will give way to the honourable gentleman. She spoke about protections for religious ministers, can she offer the same protections to registrars and as the number of mixed sex marriages should not be expected to  will they be confident that even if they decide to decline and take on the new same-sex marriage registrations that they will not lose their jobs or experience negative employment consequences? My honourable friend will know that people who are civil registrars are public servants. The recent court rulings make Mary Clear that those individuals have to carefully balance their rights to a religious belief with their right to equally make sure that they provide services in a way which does not discriminate against individuals. It is a difficult issue and I know my honourable friend is raising it for the right reasons and I'm sure it is something that will be looked at again closely in committee. Roman Catholic Spain legalise same- sex marriage in 2005. Does my honourable friend know if there has been a single case or referral to the European Court of Human Rights? Not that I'm aware of. She failed to answer the. Port by the honourable member for Belfast  Can she tell there house and the people of this country where does she have a mandate to inflict this massive social and cultural change? It was not in our party's  The Prime Minister said he had no plans introduced this. There are many major issues and this is an irrelevance and it and should not be pursued in the House least of all on a three-line notion with no opportunity to debate it. My fellow Hampshire MP and I know that we both disagreed and do so in a fair and even-handed manner. I think it is that fairness and even- handedness that I want to make sure there is there in all aspects of this Government's policy. I do think that there is an extremely strong argument that I am making here today for this measure to go  That is the reason we have parliamentary debates, to discuss these matters in detail. I think I need to make a little more progress at this time to take further interventions in a moment. I know today that for many  the crux of the issues does lie around protections, particularly for the Church of England and the Church in Wales which have a unique position because of the legal duty on their clergy to marry their parishioners. In addition because the Church of England is the established Church and its canon law is part of the law of the land. There is no disadvantage to the or favourable treatment to the Church of England or the Church of Wales. It provides a pragmatic way of putting them in the same position as other religious organisations. If they decide they want to marry same-sex  they can. We have worked very hard with a wide range of religious organisations, including both of these churches, to ensure that protections in the Bill Blain  The Church of England have commented Ahmed constructive way we have consulted on the issue of legal safeguards. Ensuring that their concerns are properly accommodated. The Church in Wales has confirmed that the Bill provides protection while still being able to make its own decisions on same-sex marriage. Turning now to one issue raised on the debate which is the concern around legal protections and also the issues around the Convention on Human Rights. There has been much discussion about the powers of the European Court of Human Rights. The case law from the court is clear. The question of whether and if so how to allow same-sex marriage must be left to the individual states to decide for themselves. Mr Speaker, it is simply inconceivable that the court would require a Faith group to conduct same-sex marriages in breach of its own doctrine. Not my  Mr Speaker, but the words of the eminent QC Lord panic, Baroness Kennedy and Lord Mayor stuff. To be  to believe that the court would order that the UK requires a religious organisations to marry same-sex couples against their religious doctrine relies on a combination of three highly improbable conclusions. First, that the court would need to they are against its own clear precedents. That countries have wide discretion in the matter of same-sex marriage.  that the court would need to decide that the interests of the same-sex couple who wanted a particular religious organisation to marry them out way it the right Samba leaves of an entire faith and his congregation as a whole.  the court would need to discount the importance of article mind of its own convention which guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It will be rewriting the rules, not just for one religious organisation in England and Wales, but for all religious organisations in all 47 states and the Council of Europe. Such an outcome is inconceivable. I give way to my honourable friend. Surely our sexuality is fundamental to he we are. Surely the crux of this debate is whether we accord equal right and respect and esteem to people regardless of sexuality. My honourable friend makes a point  We need to make sure that as a society which treats people fairly and this is at the heart of what we are talking about today. She is making a powerful case for religious freedom. Did she observed at the weekend the Church of England statement that it is not realistic or likely that churches will be forced to conduct same-sex weddings? I am glad that my honourable friend is able to underline that point because I really don't want anybody to leave this debate today without the right information on which they can base their decisions to vote. I think my honourable friend does underline the importance of the facts in this case. If honourable members can forgive me, I will make more progress. Colleagues also want to understand the consequences of this Bill more  The introduction of equal marriage will not marginalise those who believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. That is clearly an mainstream view. Neither will it continue to marginalise those who believe marriage can and should also be between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. We will not allow one to exist at the expense of the other. No misguided sense of political correctness will be allowed to impinge on this. It will be deeply divisive if in righting a wrong for some we have created a wrong for others. No teacher will be required to promote or endorse the use which go against their beliefs. No hospital chaplain or worker will have to believe in a new definition of marriage, no religious minister will have to come that same-sex marriage if the changes we are talking about today will not effect anyone more than they are affected already by choosing to live in a society that values tolerance and respect amongst its citizens. I thank the Secretary of State for  Is there anything in the provisions of this Bill that she can think of which would harm or disadvantage any heterosexual person in any way whatsoever whether of faith or not?  no. I believe that in strengthening marriage, it will actually be of benefit to all people in our society. She has made it clear she would not introduce a Bill to this house if it in any way impinge on religious use of judges or ministers. If during the passage of this Bill there may be at Thames from all sides of the house to UN pick those locks and find other ways into the Church in relation to same-sex  which you would draw her support for the Bill? What I would say is that the Church of England themselves have made very clear the importance of keeping the protections that we have in place as they are and I would be joining Mike honourable friend in saying that any such manoeuvres would be counter-  I will give way and then wind up my remarks. One of the key issues raised with me is how schools will handle the curriculum in relation to this  particularly fate schools. I am inclined to support this  but can the Secretary of State say a bit more about how this will be handled in the school  particularly in faith schools? De honourable gentleman is right to bring that out and he will have seen the words from the Secretary of State reported widely over the  The point to really make clearly to the house today is that teachers will be expected to  as indeed professionals that they would, about the law around marriage. What we never would expect a teacher to do is promote something that ran contrary to their own beliefs or religious  That is an important point and perhaps also clears up some of the misunderstandings in some of the literature that has been put around around this debate today. I cannot say no to my honourable  Then I must wind up. I am most grateful to my honourable friend who has taken a lot of interventions, but on that point, could she clarify, when she says nobody will be forced to teach anything that goes against their  what about fate schools that which to promote a particular Christian or faith view of marriage? Will they be continued to allowed to do so and can she guarantee that no teacher that actively does so will be sued or prosecuted? I think my honourable friend will know already there are provisions in place all faith groups and faith schools to talk about their beliefs when it comes to issues like  As to many other areas, whether it be divorced or people born outside of marriage, teachers have to deal with these issues  That is the point he is getting at, but just to  we would expect teachers to be professionally explaining issues to the children that they  but in no way requiring them to promote something which does not accord with their belief, their faith and I think that is right. Mr  if you can forgive me, I want to make sure I can conclude. Despite all of that discussions in  this bill is about one  It is about fairness. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so whilst protecting the rights of those who don't agree with same-sex  Marriage is one of the most important institutions we have. It binds families and societies  It is a building block that promote stability. This bill supports and cultivates marriage and I commend this bill to the The question is that the Bill now be read a second time.  Mr Speaker. Can I welcomed the speech that the Secretary of State has made today and also commend her on the manner in which she has done so. Often under pressure. And the thought almost and integrity with which she has put her points today. I would give her strong support in the approach that she has taken because to date Parliament has the chance to support loving couples who want to get married. The chance to make some of the same sex couples that I have spoken to a very happy. It means they can finally set a date for their wedding. I hope we will support this Bill today to give those couples the chance to wear and have their relationship celebrated and valued by the state in the same way as everyone else. The passage of the civil partnership bail, my honourable friend pointed out to the honourable member that it that Bill would inevitably lead on to gay  The reply was that the honourable member is mistaken. I do not want same-sex relationships to be marriage in any sense because they are different. Although they share similar elements, they do not have to be identical so legal provisions should be distinct. What And sure he would have invited you had that chance to do so. Let me move on to the issue about the difference between his civil  They have been a step forward and we are proud of that. Labour introduce them. It is also right that we take the additional step and now introduce equal marriage across the country. Of course people have strong views on  on their own and on other  I understand about some in his House are opposed to this bill and I respect of their views. I hope that is the spirit in which this debate will take place. I am grateful to you. She talks about  why isn't her side of the House arguing in favour of heterosexual couples having a civil partnerships?That that is a separate issue. There was no consultation. I am sure there will be a debate on that at a later stage I know that people have different views on it. I believe that the case for equal marriage is  It isn't the essential point the what was once a lover that dare not speak its name now will not only have recognition but will have a quality before the Amour and is that not something we should be proud of? He is completely right. We should have pride in this Parliament in giving equal rights to people to have at their relationships celebrated in the same way. Mr Speaker, it does the honourable member agree that the institution of marriage can only be strengthened if in future all citizens enjoy equality before the law and the ability to marry the person they love, regardless of their gender? I think that my honourable friend is right. Couples who love each other should be able to get married regardless of their gender and sexuality and we should enjoy and celebrate that. We all love a good wedding and we pause and walk by a Church Anne smiled at the couple who are walking by, coming out in a cloud of confetti. It is a great thing that a couple want to get married. Would she agree that there is wonderful to tolerance and -- in this society when we can celebrate our differences? We should celebrate the chance for people to get  We should celebrate the fact that different couples want to  That is exactly what we should support. It is not just about the wedding, we love our  but we all love the idea of a long and stable marriage.

If she is asking us to accept people in her party in terms of respecting religious  why does she think it was that she failed to included use of traditional marriage in the 2010 Equality Act and failed to support the right honourable gentleman been a his measures last week. His it is not right For all individual face to be protected in the air quality  I do not believe that is  We all love the idea of a wedding, we all support the idea of a strong marriage, we like a good party, I notice from the impact assessment of that the Department has produced passing this legislation could lead to £14 million extra it spent on the celebrations, which is a lot of confetti and a rubber chicken. It will not be quite enough to boosted the economy, but I guess the Chancellor of the Exchequer needs all the help he can get!, are so hopeless romantics, call the triumph of hope over experience, most of us think that when people love each other, they want to make a long-term commitment and that is a wonderful thing. Where would we stop a loving couple getting married it is because they are gay? Does she not agree that she is confusing a married with weddings? They are different things! I am sorry the honourable member is so gloomy about of the fun of a wedding which most of us has think it is an enjoyable thing to start of a marriage and I hope he would be there celebrating their golden wedding anniversary and the long- term marriage as well. I am grateful to you. When we were recalling previous debates, does he recognise that many of those people who are arguing against civil partnerships would have no argument  recognise they have been a  but perhaps the argument will have moved on in a few years and recognise that equality is a good thing in our country? He is  There are members of this House who opposed civil partnerships who now support them. They are members of the House of Lords who voted against civil partnerships and yet many in the church and now support blessings for civil partnerships. Attitudes have changed and it is right that they have done so. It is worth... I will give way and then I want to make a little progress.Thank you. The facts paint a different picture. Since same-sex marriages were introduced in Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, mixed sex marriages have decreased, indeed by tens of thousands. The facts are  In Spain it, 208 people were married in mixed sex marriages, last year 161,000 people were  so the numbers are  not increasing and the introduction of this legislation could reduce the number of parties that the Member appears to be interested in! I can say to you I think if you looked at the long- term trends across the series of different countries, those that have same-sex marriages and those  I think he would struggle to find a connection between the idea that gay and lesbian couples getting married has somehow meant that heterosexual couples are all running away from the Church door are the registry  It is worth hearing why it is that many people want to get  Here is what one gay man  he said my parents have a strong marriage, I have seen how meaningful and important it is, we want the same thing.

I said  not what you like a civil partnership.

Why should they have to? Another said, language does matter. Marriage is universally understood as a meaningful commitment. People might say that in time it civil partnerships will mean the same, we say why wait? And why should they wait? They want to celebrate in their relationship now and they could get married. I am delighted to be supporting this debate and to the voting for this bill. I have been overwhelmed by the number of young people, particularly in my constituency, who have been in touch asking me to boat macro in favour of this. With my honourable friend agreed that there it bar and number of generational issues, with most people supporting the bill being younger and some of those against have been in a later stage  shall we say? She is  Some of the polls have shown around 2000 of people overall supported same-sex marriage, but for those under 50, 80% were in it support of it will marriage and this shows the strong feeling that  the positive feeling that  I would like to thank her for giving way. There is a lot of talk about equality and fairness. I wonder if the honourable lady would like to hazard a guess as to why the word equal has been it taking out of the title of the bill, perhaps it is it because it is not as equal as the Government first expected? I suspect that the honourable member seems to have some detail in mind. I think the fundamental principal is to support equal marriage because it is to allow same-sex marriages to go ahead and it is correct about the law should do so. Does my honourable friend agree that she hopes the house will approach this subject with atonement? She will read excise the men and women who attended those first of pride marches Bennett Trafalgar Square following a stone wall and were beaten and by the police in the 1960s and this House looked any other direction. When she pay attributed to leaders of the London  who stood in the face of Clause 28 it because they chose to publish a berth in their libraries, Jenny lives with Eric and Martin? My honourable friend is right that there has been immense discrimination, including recently that there has been considerable prejudice that people who are gay or lesbian or bisexual have had to face including the violence as well and this House has a duty to stand up against that kind of violence but also against discrimination and in the interests of a quality as  I want to make progress. I am conscious that members want to speak and the restrictions are very considerable. Let me make a little progress and I will allow others to  Parliament should not stop people getting married it does because they have fallen in love with someone of the same sex and we should not say that same-sex relationships are worth less. Many have raised objections Anne's said that they fear that their church or at bay will be forced to hold same- sex marriages when they do not believe in it. They say that they believe that marriage by definition through the centuries is between a man and a woman. They believe that the heart of marriage is the biological procreation of children and that they fear that by widening marriage it will undermine other relationships, stability and  I disagree with each of these points and objections but I know they are strongly held by people whose views I respect and I want who are due -- address each. First is the fear that churches will be expected to support same-  It is clear they will  The Secretary of State gave a powerful explanation of the safeguards that are in the bill for our long tradition of respecting religious freedom, it is built into our law and traditions. I will give way in a second. The number of clauses in the this bill which the lead directly with religion is unusual and is reflected in the decision of all parties to hold free votes on this bill. Freedom of religion is rightly protected on the face of the bill as the Secretary of State set out. No religious organisation can be required to conduct a same-sex  no individual Minister can be required to come that same- sex marriages and if an individual Minister refuses to do so, that will not count as discrimination under the a quality act. The Secretary of State set out in some detail her lochs, but I hope that she will agree that churches should be able to change in their minds in future as well to support same-sex marriage in future if they want to, without an necessary hurdles and  The Church of England and the Church of Wales have the additional hurdles built into this Bill which we will need to The institution of marriage is a social institution. Does she therefore have any view that she might agree with the view that the understanding of marriage as an institution that exists for strong families changes under this Bill to an understanding of manage mealy as a point of romance? I understand a point, but I want to come on to the point he has made about whether or not extending marriage in this way will have an impact on wider family life or stability of society because it is a point I disagree with. I would also pay tribute, I know the work that the honourable member has done in tackling homophobic bullying. I give way.  I enthusiastically voted for the civil partnership bill. She didn't at that time, I'm sure she had good reason. That gave full equality in the eyes of the law for people in same-sex relationships. Why either of us homophobic for not having gone for four married at that time and what has happened in those last nine years? Is the problem not a lack of equality in  but a lack of equality in some people's eyes in society and are just changing the name of the ceremony will not change that? I would say, I think I have addressed this before, I always strongly supported civil partnerships and thing they were the right thing at the time, but I also think attitudes have moved on and it is good they have done so. And I think this is the right time to introduce same-sex marriage. I do need to make some progress. I will finally give way to my honourable friend behind. I thank my honourable friend for  but one of the things I detect through correspondence contrary to assurances we have been given is that this bill in the future will be Rees visited and  What does my honourable friend think about that? I think that the issue about the freedom of religion, which I know is one that many are concerned  is built in not just strong way into the face of this  but also into stations, political history and is something we have always valued. I suspend parliament will always want to  There are further safeguards in article 9 of the European Convention. I agree with the Secretary of State and think it is inconceivable that the European Court would tell the Church of Faith group to hold same-sex marriages despite other churches such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and others have been no successful  She is right that the European Court allows for a wide margin of appreciation. We will want to discuss specifically at committee some of the issues around the Church in Wales where, if they decide to support gay marriage, it will be subject to a potential veto by the Lord Chancellor and will require a separate both in both -- separate vote in both houses. Religious freedom goes both ways. Churches that the object should not be required to sign up, but nor should they be able to block everyone else from doing so because other people do want to. The bowling has found the majority of people wanting to support same-sex  The Quakers, Unitarians, reforms Jews all want to celebrate same-sex marriage. We argued religious marriages should be included if organised -- organisations want to. Let us be  no one group organisation or faith or institution owns marriage. Religious organisation should not be required to to hold same-sex  but more in the spirit of freedom of religion, should they prevent other religious organisations or the state from  Some have argued that marriage by definition has always been between Amman and a woman for hundreds of years and therefore should remain so. For some that is their faith and they will be able to have their fate respected, but that is not a reason to change -- to not change the law. For thousands of years same-sex couples were not allowed to marry because they were not allowed to exist. Same-sex relationships was illegal, let alone same-sex marriage. No one says we should turn back clock back. We cannot hide a discrimination by calling it a definition. Marriage has changed many times over centuries and thank goodness. For hundreds as the years, women were treated as property in marriage handed from their father to their husband and denied rights of their own until the 1990s women's bodies were treated as a husband's  If a husband raped his  it was not treated as a crime. Civil marriage was introduced over 170 years ago and that was radical  but now 160,000 of us get married in a civil ceremony  Marriage has changed before and should again. Some say they oppose because they believe that marriage is by definition about the procreation of children, but not in civil marriage it isn't and hasn't been for over a century. Many marriages are childless. We don't stop people who are too old or too sick to have children from getting married. We do not do fertility tests at the altar. In vast numbers of families, marriage is an important starting point for a loving family bringing up  but gay couples bring up children as well. As people live  the family commitments involved a marriage a much wider than bringing up children. Most MPs will know the sadness, but also the inspiration that they have drawn from visiting a long married couple where the wife, for example, is struggling to cope, struggling to remember the world around her, struggling to recognise even there has been she has shared her life  yet he carries on cooking for  washing or her, putting her to  talking to her even as she becomes a stranger in front of him. Matt his marriage. I also visited a gay man who died some years ago after a long illness in which he was cared for every day at home in  eventually in a hospice by his long-term gay partner. I don't see why that can't be marriage as well. The idea that the biology of procreation should ring -- should deny same-sex couples the respect that comes with marriage is to ignore the full richness, happiness and tragedies of family  For better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and  that his marriage. All those who argue that extending marriage to include same-sex couples will weaken or undermined marriage for everyone else, I just profoundly disagree. Mahmut -- marriage has changed many times before and society has not  Other countries are doing it and their churches and societies have not fallen apart. Catholic Spain has had the same-sex marriage has 2004. Denmark, Canada, South Africa, all celebrate same- sex marriage. France last week passed the first vote on the way to same-sex marriage. The president of the United States is in favour of equal marriage as well. If the same sex couples who have told me of their love for each other are able to get married, that won't weaken  it will strengthen it. It certainly won't make it any less likely that heterosexual couples with kids who live next door to them will stay together. If marriage is to stay relevant, important and remain a crucial part of family and social relationships, it has to remain in tune with the values of every generation and that means it should keep up with ripely changing attitudes towards homosexuality as well. The truth is that gay and lesbian couples have been locked out of too much for too long. I wonder if she would accept that there is a kind of inevitability about what will many of us are hoping to decide here this evening. We discriminated against women, we discriminated against Catholics, we discriminated against people from ethnic minorities and very  not always completely, for this house as passed legislation to remove such discrimination. Is not to this evening yet another example and opportunity to do so? The honourable member is right. This is the next step on a journey, the right one. We should not resist the valley is that I think the majority of people across the country support. The truth is, I think we have discriminated for too  People were locked up and punished for loving someone of the same sex until the 1950s. Gay men were told they were played on this country and lesbian women forced to hide their relationships. Teachers, until the early nineties, and able to tell the child of a same-sex couple that their family was OK for fear it would breach Section 28. So much has changed and a short time. Neighbouring government legalise the age of consent, ended the ban of algae BT people serving in the armed forces. Things that a controversial at the time now have widespread support. I am pleased that the vast majority of Labour MPs have said we want to support this Bill today. We have come a long way and with each step, the sky has not fallen in. The predictions that passionate opponents made at the time simply have not come true. Those opponents, in the most part, have changed their minds and moved on. I hope the same will be true again. Would it not be appropriate on this day to bear in mind to amongst all those people that were persecuted, Alan touring the, one of the most distinguished scientists of all committed suicide arising from  He should be remembered along with so many others persecuted and disgraced simply because of their sexuality. My honourable friend is right. As a society we should feel deeply ashamed to what happened to Alan  I hope, Mr Speaker... Points of order Mr David Davies. The honourable lady has taken interventions from her side of the  why not this side? It is not a point of order. I have taken interventions from many sides. Given the number on his side of the House who are desperate to speak in this debate, I am keen to allow them the opportunity to do so, even given the strong disagreements that they clearly have with each other. The opponents of measures in the past have changed their minds often and moved on, I hope the same will be true again and I hope our opponents will look back in 10 years and won't run be able to remember what the fuss is about.  let's vote for people to be able to marry for the sake of couples who really want to wear it. For the sake of religious organisations who want to celebrate same-sex marriage as part of our respect for freedom. For the sake of removing discrimination and challenging prejudice and for the sake of marriage. To keep it in touch for the next generation. In  let us celebrate not  Let's be on the right side of history and let to vote for this Bill today. The Second Church Estates Commissioner who has designated responsibilities will be subject to a 10 minute limit and there after a four-minute limit on backbench speeches -- speeches well applied. A Mr Speaker, I am confident that we are all created in the image of God whether we be straight, gay, bisexual or transsexual. We are all equally worthy him guard's sight and equally loved by God. I am also sure that we should be equally welcome at God's table. Equal must has not always equate with being  For centuries, civilisations have recognised the value and importance to society of having and enduring an exclusive union between one man and one woman, not least for the raising and nurturing of children. That relationship is called marriage. The uniqueness of marriage is that it embodies the distinctiveness of men and women. Removing that complementarity from the definition of marriage is to lose any social institution where sexual difference is explicitly acknowledged. The government will appreciate the value of marriage. One of the points about the legislation today is that the Bill makes no provision for heterosexual couples to enter into civil partnerships. Policy makers considered that allowing heterosexual couples to enter into civil partnerships would undermine the institution of marriage, so what this legislation will do his and the constitution of marriage as it has been understood by society in general and by almost all faith I shall vote against the bill. From  ministers have made clear that they intend that the legislation will give protection and ensure that churches to do not wish to perform a same-sex marriages are not forced to do to  This is consistent with the legislation relating to civil partnerships where it is for a faith groups for a whole if they decide to opt in. It may be helpful to be House if I made clear the views of the Church of England on the safeguarding of religious  I entirely accept the government's good faith that in this matter and I appreciate of the Thames the government has made. The government wants to ensure that every church and a nomination can reach his own conclusion on these matters and be shielded from the risk of litigation. The so called quadruple lochs are sensible and  It was unfortunate that few months ago when the government was talking about the banning of the Church of England and the Church in Wales from doing anything because that was a complete the misleading account and I am pleased to see that nothing of that kind of features in the bill or in the Secretary of State's explanation. The Church of England and the Church in Wales have not wanted anything different in substance from all other churches and faiths, namely to be left free to determine their own and doctrine and practices in relation to marriage. Achieving that is more complex in relation to the Church in Wales because it retains the common law duty to marry all parishioners. It is more complicated in relation to the Church of England because as well as their common law duty, the canon law remains part of the law of the land and it also has its own will legislate to they can amend Church legislation and Westminster legislation and I am grateful to the government for trying to get these matters right and by and large I think they have done so. I will not give way because lots of colleagues want to get in on this  They should be grateful if my right honourable friend could confirm that that Clause 11, son  might still benefit from some further attention, given the needed to avoid her having to act as the arbiter in relation to particular areas of the ecclesiastical law. This is an area where time ran out in the discussions and I would hope that that the Government would be open to further drafting changes if they could be agreed during the passing  Let me be clear, we do think that the government has done its best it given its intention to introduce same-sex marriage but as many other commentators have made  there is a degree of risk in all of this given that it would ultimately lead to the courts to decide whether the provisions in the legislation are compatible with the European Convention of Human  There is no doubt that once a marriage is redefined in this fundamental way, whole a number of new legal questions will arise and that no one can be sure what the eventual outcome will be. The government believes it is a risk worth taking but the Church of England does not and the Roman Catholic Church does not and a number of other faith groups including in the Muslim faith and they do not believe it either. This raises other issues. Whilst at the failure to consummate the marriage will still be grounds on which at the sexual marriage will be  this will not be a ground on which the marriage of the same- sex couple will be voidable and it provides that adultery will have an existing definition, namely the sexual intercourse for the person of the opposite sex. Divorce law for heterosexual couples will be different to divorce laws for same- sex couples and as for heterosexual  the matrimonial offence of adultery will persist while still there will be no similar matrimonial offence in relation to same-sex marriage. I think that officials have been unable to apply these long-standing concepts to same-sex marriage is a further demonstration of just how problematic the concept is of same- sex marriage. Clearly, if every member is going in accordance with our own consciences to come up to an individual judgment on these issues and of the House accordingly will come to a collective judgment and so far as the specific protections that the government is seeking to give to judges who do not wish to perform same-sex  I believe that they are being done in the best Of Faith And as robustly as possible. The government feels that they can do so and I would reiterate that there is no way in which all of us can know just how robust those protections will be until they are tested in the courts. Notwithstanding the efforts made by the government to protect churches who do not wish to perform a same- sex marriages, the Church of England cannot support of the proposal to enable all couples regardless of the agenda to have a civil marriage ceremony. This will alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the Union of a man and a woman enshrined throughout history and it will change the nature of marriage for everyone and it will deliver no obvious gains given that the rights already conferred by civil partnerships. I am deeply saddened at the divisions and upset that this has cost to people on both sides of the  Some of that division is because the debate has been characterised as an bigoted religion on one hand and versus equality on the other. Neither of those are true. True Christians are not bigoted and this is not a matter of a quality. Some of the divisions are from at the campaign that to steer people into thinking that marriage is simply about love and commitment. The bill also falls foul of Parliament's convention of not legislating retrospectively, changing the nature of marriage will affect existing marriages. The law as it stands and has been tested in the European Court of Human Rights, civil partnerships are equal to marriage, they may not have the same name but they are  It has been argued that society views of marriage and civil partnerships as different as same- sex couples feel at their religion is not have valued by society in the same way as marriage. It is not yet ten years since civil partnerships were created and already society has moved ahead in appreciation of those partnerships. As an atheist I enjoy the right to get married outside a church. Surely those who do believe have a right to get married in at their church? I am coming to the point that she raises in a moment. Perhaps part of society that do not few civil partnerships as in his marriage do so because a large proportion of the society views marriage as a union between a man and woman and creating children. Civil partnerships are a celebration of recognition of the love and commitment that two people of this engender have four for one  The state saw to treat marriage in a special way because of the children. That is why the state BBC had an interest in  It is simply about marriage and commitment... That the definition of marriage is simply love and commitment, why is the state interested at all? What business is it of the state? It is because marriage is about so much  Thank you. The state has intervened been married on several  one of these is in relationship to property rights which has nothing to do with The state has changed some of the areas of marriage, but not the intrinsic measure. Under the terms of the bill, there will be marriage but in two forms, a traditional marriage and same-sex  that is new are the same  The bill creates further inequality with traditional marriage has been allowed in some churches and not others and same- sex couples will be allowed the towers of civil partnership or  worse same-sex couples can only have traditional marriages. This bill is trying to engineer a cultural equivalent to tackle a perceived lack of inequality in wider society and it does not sound like the basis of marriage to me. The government says that the bill as after the projects religions, but there are conflicting legal opinions which challenged that view. There is nothing it to stop a future government legislating to allow or require churches to celebrate the same-sex marriages.  some commentators have said they cannot wait until the Church of England and other faiths have to conduct a same-sex  given at the bill creates inequality, the legal challenge would surely be  Mr Speaker, I am amazed that the government should bring forward his bill at a time when there are other pressing issues. Let me explain. Despite having a gay friends and relatives, this issue has never once been brought to my attention. I have never had a constituent to write to me asking me to raise this issue. I recall many MPs were quick to praise of the civil partnership legislation has been everything the gay community wanted and created the a quality they had fought for for so long and that has been mentioned  my honourable friend has previously said that in his view, the idea that the gay community do not one marriage was a nonsense. Marriage is the Union of a marriage and a woman named at caring for  not in all cases, but that is the intrinsic value. This legislation will fundamentally change that and despite all the issues that have been raised, all the insults that have been thrown from both sides, I will be opposing  It creates inequality, I believe it does not tackle and in a quality that is there on the basis that the legislation has been tested in the European courts and there has been shown it to be no  I will oppose it and I would urge any members thinking of abstaining to vote against.Thank  It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member. I will follow on from his point. This bill does not create -- create equality, it highlights the inequalities which are always going to be there because the definition of marriage is based on the definition of sex.  it is impossible to shoehorn end of same-sex marriage and to provide equality. The campaigners have set themselves that what they have been looking for is a bill which will provide them to have the same rights as heterosexual couples and to be able to enjoy a faithful and committed relationships. This bill in no way makes a requirement of faithfulness from same-sex couples, in fact, it does the opposite. In a heterosexual marriage, a couple can divorce for adultery and the legal requirement is adultery is if you have sex with a member of the opposite sex. In heterosexual  a couple vow to forsake all others and what they are basically saying, and it is in accordance with the Act, it what they are basically saying is I will forsake all others because to you I will be faithful, in honour of our vows and my faithfulness to the  A gay couple have no obligation to make the that foul because they do not have to forsake  because they cannot divorce for adultery. There is no requirement of faithfulness and if there is no requirement of their  what is a marriage? Another aspect of this, like the Minister  there is no requirement in a marriage for consummation, there is  A marriage is voidable without  In his bill, there is no requirement of conservation, because the definition of marriage when a definition of sex is for ordinary and complete sex to take  same-sex couples cannot meet this requirement. The Government have attacked this particular aspect right at the back of the  possibly because they do not want this to be debated during the Committee Stage and it is quite sad, because it is part of the inequality which, I think, if I was part of a gay couple, I would be like a poor relation. I would they look like this was a shoddy bill in which we were not as well considered as heterosexual couples. It does highlight the inequalities. Mr Speaker, I would hope the Minister would come to the Benson and elucidate on one point. Peter Tatchell apparently said that the Prime Minister was inspired by his words and that the Prime Minister used his lines in his speech to bring forward this bow macro. I respect his right to do that, but he also said that equality was not  that we are social revolution is, we're out to turn a society and the world upside down. Would the Minister tell us that he has not inspired his bill, it is not based on his words and repudiated the overall intentions I think today as a very significant day and it is that a about one of those fundamental principles which each of the bloody all parties represented in this House  We basically a lad and  We let people get on with their lives and give people that are gay the right -- the same rights that we enjoy. Both sides have been respectful and passionate. I have had the demeetings with objectors in my constituency to understand the objections. -- three  If this Bill is passed by will have further meetings were then to discuss the details. Some members have claimed that there are flaws in the bill. If members decide to vote against the Bill when there is a flaw in it, no bill will get past the second reading. We have to look at what is centrally important of allied to recognise there are worries among  The world is changing and that is about what people are  We have had on -- confirmation from the Secretary of State today that there is no compulsion on faith groups took off  -- to opt in. I am glad that the Secretary of State has confirmed there is no requirement on teachers to promote gay marriage and in fact it will make no difference to any questions they might be asked in exactly the same way as they would on civil partnerships. Members of my constituency were very concerned  As a Christian myself, Christianity is a very generous  As a Christian, I feel that Jesus Christ absolutely led the way in terms of promoting a  There are any number of stories in the Bible that make it absolutely clear that Jesus Christ stuck up the many groups that were expressed over the years.

My honourable friend is making a brilliant speech. Would he agree that this is about equal respect for everyone?

I know how difficult it was for me as a young man growing up in Sheffield to think that my friends might discover that. It is fundamentally about mutual respect and I think that is why the majority of people ultimately support this because the majority of people recognise that people are many different and some of them have the right to enjoy the same things as other people do. Would he agree with me that there are many strands of thought across the religious community? One person contacted me to say that my Church advised me to write to you opposed in gay marriage but forgive me if I  The whole debate reminds me of a colleague on the council who when told by one of the all the councillors that may have legalised homosexuality, expecting he would be appalled he said, as long as it is not made compulsory. The principles are ones which many people in Britain will recognise. While there was no manifesto commitment, I understand the Conservative Party's contracts for equality makes this absolutely clear it is something the Government will consider. When I spoke to Nadine Dorries this  she said she had nowhere this may have a contract when she stood for election. It is important that this was something the Conservative Party was talking about previously. The final. I would make is that I think today as a very important day and one we'll look back on in many years to come and will say we made the right decision today. There will still be time to scrutinise the legislation and there will be opportunities for people to make further representation but today is about recognising there is a place for gay people in our society and who may have the right to enjoy the respect for their relationship that the rest of us enjoy and I hope members will support that. It really is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Chesterfield who I think is articulated what many people across our country have stubble that but have come to the conclusion that lovers for one and all and married should not be an exclusive institution. -- love is. I am a a man who grew up in a rural working-class background.

I am standing here today to welcome this historic legislation which I think we'll end discrimination but also crucially send a signal that this House that -- values everyone equally across this country. I saw on this House and bought 20 years ago to equalise the age of consent and it was the first time I recognise that I was not alone and it changed my life. When we take this step, we should recognise that 70 years ago thousands of homosexual men and women were put to death in concentration camps and 30 years ago we still have people being subjected to scientific torment in search of a cure. We have come a long way in a short space of time but it is absolutely right in my view that this House takes the next step and delivers the legal  Let me say to those members who will say, he would say  This view is one that is born of a hatred of discrimination and prejudice of all types whether it is of skin colour or religion. We should be valuing diversity but treating everyone equally. These values are enshrined in Cornwall's  It is a community I grew up in and one I am proud to represent, it values community. Up it is not apart from if you're Catholic or were black or homosexual. It is about this trust of abuse of power and it is so right to have made sure that this House will not compel any religious organisations to do anything they do not want to  We have struck the right balance between Equality and religious freedom. We know that marriage as an important institution that the lovers many positive benefits in terms of stability and health. If we recognise those benefits, why would we keep them away from some of our neighbours who seek to experience them if they choose to a their faith allows them. We would not allow this level of discrimination in it any other sphere of life. Equal marriage will not be the end of the struggle for up homosexual equality in the way that delivering the franchise to women or up apartheid was in those battles. It will however send a clear signal that we value everybody equally. Can I congratulate the honourable gentleman for his very honest and open contribution to this debate.

Can I just suggest that what he has suggested is profoundly offensive not only to people in this country who've performed civil partnerships but to quite a few people in this House? The merit of my argument is not  but from a lawyer, is that it might create a level playing field and it would leave marriage and faith to those who understand that marriage means faith and that marriage means a union between a man and a woman and nothing else. The honourable gentleman may seek to bat my argument away, but I promise him that in this House and outside it there are many people who share this view. To cob include, I urge members of -- to conclude, I urge members not to abstain. If they support this measure, vote for  If they vote against it, vote against it as I shall myself. Mr Deputy Speaker, I had a man come to my surgery called Mr Proctor two  He had never been to see an MP before but said he had never felt so strongly on an issue before. He wanted to know where I stood on an issue such as redefining  I said I took the opposite view so him. He said,  you've lost my vote." I said I felt as strongly as he did on this issue and if it meant that people would vote against me at the general election, so be it. We had a long discussion about the redefinition of marriage. I didn't deny it was redefinition, that until now marriage's only been possible between a man and a woman. But what I wanted to do was to widen access to an institution that has brought stability and happiness to so many relationships. Mr Proctor was a probation officer. He had seen lots of family breakdowns and the terrible consequences of it. He believed that a traditional husband and wife set-up was the best for bringing up children. He blamed absent fathers for the riots the London in 2011. I couldn't see how that linked to gay couples enjoying the same rights as homosexual couples and bringing up children in a stable relationship. He believed deeply that a child in an ideal world needs both a mother and a father. I believe as deeply that a gay couple can bring up a child equally well. We agreed to  But then he said, "What I'm bothered about is that people like me are regarded not as having a different point of view but as bigots and homophobes. I am neither a bigot nor a homophobe. The I have strong views about this and they are traditional views but why does that suddenly make me completely beyond the pale?" We talked about equality and equal treatment, that they weren't forcing people into same sex relationships. We discussed the identity of equality for a long time. Equality for whom, he asked? He felt not just excluded from my idea of equality but criminalised by it. He wanted to know what would happen to people  with traditional views. I thought a long time about the importance of not being zealots and bigots about this, of understanding the other point of view. We are, I  going to make a lepgtsive change that will make it legal for two men or two women to be married. Just like when we outlawed the enciment to racial hatred we started a cultural shift in the way society thinks about race, so hopefully this legislation will do  But we want to take people with us, Mr Deputy Speaker, not leave them behind, feeling that their views are neither heard nor  Living in a democracy means that the majority of view generally prevails, but that makes it even more important to ensure that the minority view is considered and taken into confirm I like and respect Mr Proctor, but I disagree with his point of view. And I look forward to voting for same sex marriage this evening. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. Marriage is one of the most important institutions in our  It concern Miss of us that it is in decline. Yet while many move away from marriage, one group turns towards it. Gay couples are now asking to be admitted, so here we have a section of society who are saying they want to declare  they value stability in the sight of the public and perhaps  We defenders of marriage should be gratefully opening the  yet the reaction of some has been to slam it shut. It is said that gay people should accept civil partnerships and no more, which confer most of the legal rights of  Thousands of people, like me have caused to be grateful for the courage of honourable members who voted for that change. Entering a civil partnership was the most important thing I have done in my life. Then, civil partnerships were opposed by the  opposed by a significant proportion of the public and opposed by many honourable members. Just eight years later only a small minority of the public oppose them and many honourable members who voted against the change now say they support it. But people choose marriage for a reason. They know that it means something special. Indeed it is because marriage is different that many are opposing  So we cannot say that civil partnerships are the same or dismiss the debate about being about a name. And how many married couples would be like to be told that they were banned from matrimony and able only to take out a civil partnership. The Church of England and Catholic Church object to gay marriage. I disagree with  But their religious freedom is surely among the greatest prize of our democracy. I would not vote for this Bill unless I believed that it protected religious freedom. No faith group should be compelled by law to conduct a gay marriage against it will and none will be. But why should the law prevent labour views or quakers or Unitarian churchs from conducting gay marriages if they wish to do so. I do not believe there are sufficient grounds to oppose a measure that allows gay marriages  You do not have to enter a gay marriage.

LAUGHTER I appreciate the serious points made, but some of the objections do not bear scrutinyny. We are told because there won't be a legal definition of consummation there's a terrible flaw in the Bill, but many loving homosexual marriages exist without consummation. Are they invalid? To some the objection is to homosexual conduct itself. That view is in decline. I'm  Does he agree with me that achieving legal equality is absolutely critical but it is and will only ever be part of the battle for acceptance? I strongly agree with my honourable friend. I believe that many who do not share this view nevertheless have a principled concern that gay marriage would mean redefining institution for everyone. Yet Parliament has repeatedly done this. If marriage hadn't been redefined in 1836 there wouldn't be any civil  If it hadn't been redefined in 1949, under-16-year- olds would still be able to get  If it hadn't been redefined in 1969 we wouldn't have today's divorce laws. And all of these changes were opposed. I thank the honourable member for giving way and praise his advocacy. Can I agree with him that the definition of marriage is in fact what it means most to us as individuals? I define marriage as something that is about a loving long term relationship. That is something to be celebrated and something that should be open to all in our society? I agree with the honourable gentleman this is an institution that should now be open  When I was born homosexual conduct was a crime. Not so long ago it was possible to sack someone because they were game people did not dare to be open. Thank goodness so much has changed in my lifetime. This progress should be celebrated, but we should not believe that the journey is complete. I think of the gay children who are still bullied at schools or are fearful about whether their friends and family  I think of sportsmen  vital role models, who still don't feel able to come out. I know that the signal we send today about whether the law fully recognises the place of gay people in our society will really matter.  I think of two people, faithful and loving, who simply want their commitment to be recognised as it is for straight  And that in the end is what this Bill is about. Millions will be watching us today. Not just  but those who wants to live in a society where people are treated equally and accepted for who they are. They will hear our words and remember our votes. I hope that once again this House will do the right thing. May I say what a privilege to the follow that excellent speech. Given the time constraints I'm going to focus my constituents as a member of the Anglican church and of the ecclesiastical committee of this and the other place. I entirely support the Government's decision to make this a permissive law, allowing those religious, religions and denominations that wish to celebrate the loving same sex relationships of their members to  White as the member just said to have been perverse to say to the quakers, the united reform churn or the progressive sin golings who wish to support their gay and lesbian members they wouldn't be allowed to do so. There are many Anglicans and Roman Catholics who wish their churches were as open and welcoming as those who are supporting this bill  In fact all the opinion polls sew that a majority of the Anglicans and of Roman Catholics in this country support gal marriage.  in their wisdom the leadership of the Sir Mervyn King and the Roman Catholic Churchs aren't -- did leadership of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Churchs aren't prepared to take that stand. However, the church's credibility in arguing this would be a lot more convincing if they welcomed and celebrated civil partnerships tfplstacket that they don't leads me to conclude that -- the fact that they don't leads me to conclude that it is about a residual prejudice against same sex relationships. The Church of England has claimed and repeated again because of its established status and the need for state and Cannon Law to be compatible it regards this extra safeguards on the face of the Bill not allowing same sex weddings in the Church of England and the Church of Wales. The so-called quadruple lock. When members of this House and the other place asked the Bishop of Leicester in the presence of the new Archbishop of Canterbury why the Church wanted this quadruple lack,  "We didn't want it. We hadn't asked for it and we hadn't been consulted." I would be grateful if when the Minister or her colleague sums up at the end of the this debate, she could perhaps clear up the confusion I think there is in Anglican circles about where exactly they do stand on the issue of the quadruple lock and their claim that where the Church  as many in the Church of England including I hope it will at some stage embrace same sex  there'll be no need for primary legislation or an amendment to it in this House. That is what they've said. I'm not a constitutional expert but I'm not aware having been in this House for 15 years of any precedent whereby an outside institution can unilaterally decide to change primary legislation that we pass in  I question the Church of England's claim that were it to change its mind in the future it could do so just like that, the Synod could vote for it and we wouldn't having to do anything  My fear is we would have to amend primary legislation. I ask her to check whether this quadruple lock is really necessary in law and whether the Church is being upfront with its own members about the hurdles white place in Would BE banned from up marrying same-sex couples at in another church under the law as proposed? Four minutes is not enough to let my argument on this select nearly ate some ground rules. If this legislation passes through  it will not be the end of the world as we know what.  if it does go through it will not signal some resurgence in up intolerance are any quality. No one will lose any wrecks to the equal treatment under the law. No doubt some of the constituents who have written to oppose this Bill do so out of intolerance to same-sex relationships on even homophobia. I would say not to vote against this bill on behalf of those who are guilty of intolerance themselves. The vast majority if not all of the members of this House are not a homophobic let us have this important debate on the basis of respecting each other's positions. Let us hope this rubs off for once on some over-zealous lobby grips. Let us get away from this ridiculous mentality that if you are not for some specific issue, you against the entire cause. That if you are not in favour of gay  you a homophobic. What nonsense! I feel immensely special and proud to be British but that does not make me racist or her mean that high regard other people as  I supported the civil partnership bill and 90 should have come sooner. I do not regard a couple in joined in a civil partnership as in feria event did - - or in equal to mind. It achieved  I read the debate and I found no accusations that we wear at the time bigoted or homophobic. What happened between 2000 and for her and now do to make this bill so Argent and pressing that it takes priority now despite no manifesto commitment and no white paper and no general campaign coming to us saying that we must desperately have this? I will give way. I am listening carefully as always. Insomuch as the Bill as an answer to any question that all it may be an attempt to make up a section that civil partnerships are somehow  Given his argument, would he agree that the progress of outcome from this process so far is to somehow make that a section without the redefining marriage and so are sending so many of mind and his constituents. It comes back to a point made earlier that it should be about equal respect. The real problem is not about black of the quality under the law but about people's perceptions of it. We need to double efforts to root out that sort of lack of equality but changing the nature and the work of a ceremony will not do that. We are completely misleading ourselves if we think that it will. Why has this bill taken such priority when there are other began in the qualities it  Members in the Upper House cannot take seats, inherit seats if they are women. That is a big in any quality and this has taken  -- bigger inequality. Only some of the reasons to object to this bill are religious. Many reasons against this bill are based on poor drafting with a whole rash of what nexts? Many worries may turn out to be hollow but the historical truth has held that marriage is a union of one man and  We are entitled to more security that quickly drawn up quadruple Lochs that lawyers are already queuing up to pick apart. Marriage has met one man and one woman across cultures and ages since before state and religion  I do not claim that my church marriage is superior to another civil partnership. It is equal but different. Let us get away from the basis that for  you have to have the same to be equal. I arrives today to strongly support this bill as a practising Christian in the Church  I say this with the greatest courtesy and respect for people who disagree with me on this  While I disagree with arguments that have been put forward in opposition, I cannot go into detail today on why believe those views are in error. I am proud of the steps the last Labour government took towards Equality but I must put forward its my thanks to the government for putting forward this bill. As a disestablished Church, the Church of Wales that is uniquely placed. The Archbishop of Wales believes this bill has now much improved and has stated that the duty will not be extended to same-sex couples however there is provision in the bill for the lot to be altered without further primary legislation. While it is of great personal regret to me that my church does not permit same-sex marriage, what is exemplified here is that they will not be forced to do so under proposed legislation and there could not be more appropriate  I will argue and pray for my church to change from within it but it is a theological issue former church. This bill is not about compulsion but about permission for the state to offer same-sex marriage to all those who request it and for religious organisations to be able to do so. I have spoken in detail about why believe these -- this bill will provide protection for those with sincerely held belief. Honourable members here remain concerned should be assured on that but I believe there is no cause for fear. I believe that all stubbles for Equality in human history have some common characteristics. I do not wish to be crooks in making comparisons nor do I imply that any member in this House would have taken the opposing side, but there are important parallels in the development of used on those issues. I believe future generations will look back on deep confusion on some of the views that have been  Pat Robertson is no proponent of same-sex marriage, he is a staunch opponent, but when questioned recently why slavery was justified on the interpretation of biblical verse, he said we had moved on until we realised that slavery was terribly wrong. These are very different issues but I hope we can move forward today in Our conception of people of all  One of my constituents wrote to me simply asking to please vote in favour of this bill so my partner and I can get married.

We are proposing to make stark changes on the essence of marriage and during the civil partnership debates I was given solemn assurance on the floor of the House by people sitting opposite to me now it that the civil partnership bill would not lead to fool same-sex marriage.

For assurances from they are not necessarily going to determine the future of what happens in Parliament. -- from me. Several honourable members have already raised what I said in  At the time, I believed that was the whole of the story but since then I have entered a civil partnership and I do now believed that the world has moved on. Many members on the opposite side of the House now recognise that Britain's mines have changed and what that changed in the body of the loch. The world may move on again and many of the assurances we are now getting may not count for very much. And respect that this Parliament is  it matters not what anybody says in any debate because Parliament can trump that in an you  This is not the first time he has been wrong, by the way! I am one of those who voted for civil partnerships expecting that to be the end of the story but was then confronted by thousands of people in civil partnerships who would really like to be married. That is what this is about. That is precisely what I want now to talk  The catechism of the Roman Catholic church describes this institution but anybody of any faith or no fate who supports traditional marriage would be echoed these words. Marriage is a covenant where a man and a woman establish themselves and partnership for the whole of life. It is by its nature border towards the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of  What does this tell us? Many millions of our fellow citizens believe that marriage is by its nature are heterosexual  It is the bringing together of one man and one woman. It is not just a romantic attachment which can exist between it any two people. It is not just a sexual relationship. It is the act of marriage which by its very definition requires two people of opposite sexes. If you take that basic requirement today, what you're not -- what you're left with is not marriage. Marriage may have always been evolving but this is potential to bring together two elements needed to bring about a  The very reason that marriage is underpinned with laws and customs because children usually often result from it. They need protecting from the tendency of adults to want to break their ties and cast off their responsibilities. Marriage exists to keep the parents exclusively committed to one another, because on average that is the boast, most stable environment for children. If marriage was solely about the relationship between two people, we would not bother to enshrine it in  Nor would every culture, society and rblg for -- religion for thousands of years have vested it with such importance, because it is about protecting the future. Marriage is not about me, me, me. It is not about my rights, it is not about my relationships being legally validated but about raising children based on life-long commitment and exclusivity. Marriage is also profoundly  since it is generally men who've the greater propensity to wander off into other relationships. It is women in general who are left holding the baby. We have to to get away with the idea -- get away from the idea that everything is seen through the ruthless chism of  Not at the expense of every other consideration. Not at the expense of tradition. We should be in the business of protecting cherished institutions and our cultural heritage. Otherwise what,  is a Conservative Party for? Indeed we are alienating people who've voted for us for for all  leaving them with no- one to vote for. I would add this comment from a lady who e-mailed me. As a gay woman in a 24-year-old relationship I commend you on your stand against this nonsense perpetrated by the Government. I contracted a civil partnership in  I can see this latest piece of nonsense as a final piece of -- a final kicks in the teeth for loyal Conservatives. I will be voting tonight to proclaim my support for the future of our children and the essence of traditional marriage. We've all had many letters from constituents about the matter before us this afternoon. One I received came from a couple who first met in 1978. They've been in a loving and committed relationship  They are accepted, welcomed and supported as a couple by their friends and their family. And they've waited 35 years for this House to finally catch up where what they and their friends already knew - that their same sex relationship is every bit as valid, every bit as important and every bit as equal as their straight friends' relationships. Over the period of their relationship there've been huge changes in how society at large views them and same sex couples like them. I marched in protest 25 years ago when in House passed Section 28, a piece of legislation that offensively characterised same sex relationships as pretend. The fact that we have a quite different piece of legislation before us today is testament to the power of politics to change minds and build a better society. And as I condemned the Conservative Prime Minister who promoted Section 28 all those years ago, today I pay tribute to the Conservative Prime Minister who has provided leadership on this issue. The legislation before us is a tribute to the legacy of campaigners like Michael Cashman and Chris Smith, to numerous essentially progressive campaign ers in the community, to LBGT people who've suffered discrimination in their lives because of how they were born, and couples whose determination to square equality was driven by the knowledge that the lover they experienced in their relationships was no less than anyone else's  I'm grateful to him for  She making a powerful case against skim nation. Will he agree that one group still discriminated against is the transcommunity and that one outcome of this proposal is their ability to change their gender without being forced first to end their marriage? That will be a relief to many transpeople in their community. I'm happy to agree with the points she makes and I hope changes will be made in due course to reflect that. The argument that extending marriage to same sex couples in anyway diminishes anyone's relationship is spurious. One person's happiness does not diminish another person's. Rather, it adds to the total sum of human  Surely that is to be This measure strengthens rather than weakens marriage by extending it to more people. If you don't like gay marriage, don't marry someone gay, but please don't deny that right to loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. Mr Deputy Speaker, equality is indivisible. You cannot be partially equal. You are either equal or you are not. The prize of this legislation will be to build a lasting political consensus in favour of equality. Today this House must put itself on the right side of public opinion and on the right side of history by recognising in law at last that every person has the fundamental human right to love and to marry whoever they choose. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. It is an honour to follow the Member for Croydon West. I feel that over the last six months a certain distress about the way this debate has been managed and the pressure that's been put on so many of my colleagues. From pressure groups and churches, who in my view should have known better in the tactics they've deployed. I feel I've been lake a false sense of security given the chains that have been made legislatively over the last decade -- the changes that have been made electively over the  I'm indebted to the Prime Minister not just for this Bill but the changes he has brought about within my party, has has led to my own election and that of many others and changed the face of the parliamentary party. I do feel that as a result of this debate, not just today but over the last six  we've we may have gone two steps forward but I fear we've gone one step backward. The modernisation of the Conservative Party is not yet complete. I will give way to the honourable lady. I thank the honourable lady. Has she,  been particularly angered and frustrated by the tactics of the campaign director of the Coalition for Marriage, who has e- mailed people udgeing them to write to their MPs to say we will hold you to account and we will tell your friends and family and we will not vote for you. This is a free  Members should be voting with their conscience, not on the basis of threats for future electoral  The honourable lady has made her point far better than die  I would say that the Coalition for Marriage, and some of the churches have deliberately and consistently misinterneted the Government's intentions by -- misinterpreted the Government's intentions by saying we are fosing churchs to marry same sex couples. That was not the intention and I would never have supported it had  The Church of England has finally admitted that it is not realistic or likely that churchs would be forced to conduct same sex  But so easy to say that now when practically every person I meet who doesn't follow the deliberations of political detail in great detail has said to me, "It is about weddings in churches for gay people isn't it?" that is the misapprehension that many of my constituents who are opposed to this Bill have laboured only, including members of my own  I would like to put on record my appreciation of those individuals who've treated me with courtesy and respect so I I can support this Bill without fear or  Many of them believe that we are legislating for gay weddings  and we are not. I'm satisfied by the advice of the Attorney General that that is of an infinitesimal possibility. Nobody can legislate against somebody challenging something in the courts but the case law in the European Court of Human Rights makes it unlikely that any such challenge would succeed. She's making a very powerful speech. Does he agree there are many countries in Europe who are members of Council of Europe who've introduced same sex marriage while at the same time protecting ridgous freedom? It is not beyond the wit of man or woman in our country to do the same? I thank the honourable lady for her intervention. She is absolutely  In fact there was a case in 2010 from Austria and the European Court of Human Rights said there was no obligation on any secular Government to guarantee the rights of gay people to marry each other. Another point that has been made in  Mr Deputy Speaker, is that equality isn't all that  and we are different and we should celebrate differences. I agree with that. We should sembrait cultural and other differences, but having been different for most of  Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that being treated equal is very welcome indeed. We still have some way to go not just in the area of gay people but in other  I believe my party should never flinch from the requirement that we must continue this progression. Otherwise we may end up like the Republican Party who lost an election last year they could have won if it not for their essentially conservative agenda. One last point which hasn't been  That is that gay people have always been allowed to marry as long as they choose someone of the opposite sex. LAUGHTER This has been the case in politics and in Hollywood for reasons that are well  Many gay people today appreciate the civil partnerships but do want more. Do want the status of marriage. I'm particularly thinking of the younger gay people, who didn't have to grow up in the environment that some of us had to grow up in. I support their right to declare their love in a state of marriage. I can assure honourable member this is will not undermine traditional  It is a privilege to stand here today in the greatest seat of democracy in the world to be a part of this debate on the redefinition of marriage. This is the biggest single mailbag I've had in all my dangers as an MP, an MLA and councillor in previous jobs. I listen to my constituents, not just one or two but all of them.

I give one example, Islington council sacked a woman for requesting an accommodation of her objection to same-sex civil partnership. The European Court confirmed that a public authority can enforce employees to act against their beliefs and sack any who resist. The lock also fall down when it comes to the European Court. Maybe the Minister will give us some other definition of why we should feel that Europe will support us? Back in December 2011 the Prime Minister stated that UK is a Christian country and we should not be ashamed to say so. I urge the government to put into practice this statement. Don't take away the right for people to do this and say it's for equality, it is not. Let people live their faith without fear of persecution, aided by this government. I urge all right honourable members and honourable members to oppose this bill.

I hope we are understanding of the difficulty that colleagues have and the difficulty our constituents have in understanding the other side of the argument. Two of the strongest arguments made against the Bill are that there was no election manifesto by any of us that we should legislate. That this is a redefinition of marriage, the point made by the honourable  It wasn't an election commitment. I have asked the Secretary of State and I call again today for the Government and Parliament to proceed very slowly and carefully and seek maximum  Heavy programming and tight timetables are going to be the enemy of good legislation.

It would have been better we could have started in that way. It's too late to do that now, lat least given the position of the established church. What I hope we'll do is give a second reading to the Bill today, but then work on the areas that, in my view, are not yet in a fit state to be finalised as legislation. I do believe that the Bill ought to be amended to make it clear that the principle purpose is to provide for Equal Civil Marriage for gay and straight couples and for others to opt-in to that if churches and other doe nominations which them to do. So I don't think that is the way the Bill is drafted at the moment at  I think the Bill ought to be more clear that we are not seeking to redefine the traditional marriage as previously understood in custom and law. That would be  both to the church communities and to others, and I've talked to many, both in the churches and elsewhere, I believe there is a constructive will to try to improve the Bill, even from people at the end who might not  I'm sure there will be - I imagine there will be a majority for second reading tonight. One of the things that we have to do is disabuse people who think there will be prohibition on the way people can speak about things. The way people can breach about these things and what happens in  The Joint Committee on Human Rights will address this issue intensely and I'm sure we will be able to give guarantees to those who fear their right to speak and believe what they have will be changed by the Bill. I hope we will address two other things too. I supported civil partnerships. I think the church was wrong to oppose civil partnerships at the  I hope the church understands and other faith jobs they would do themselves a service if they had a service of blessing for people in civil partnership. It wouldn't be good to have an easy transfer from civil partnership to civil marriage, if we are having civil marriage there should be an obligation to have the ceremony of civil marriage so that the full import is  I don't understand why the Government isn't taking the opportunity to provide civil partnerships should be available for conventional male/female relationships as well as for gay people as well? I hope there will be changes. That is why my intervention on the Secretary of State asked for her to consider  before committee and report stage, constructive suggestions for change. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, given the complexity of the Bill we need to have that tolerance and respect. On Saturday night I watched the new film Lincoln, of course, as the honourable gentleman for Cardiff  there aren't exact parallels between that battle over slavery and this. There is a lesson. People at that stage took different sides of a very intense argument, even though they came from the same faith and another background. Things move on. We have to learn that understanding each other's position and seeking the maximum consensus is the best way to  I hope that's the way we will continue. I too welcome the tenor of this debate. This is clear from the debate same-sex marriage is an issue in which people have different opinions and on each side of the argument express their views with differences. As someone who believes firmly in equality and human rights I would strongly defend people's rights to express their views freely within the law. Regardless of how repug napblt I might find them or how strongly I may disagree with them. However, I would remind opponents of same-sex marriage of the much quoted words of the late American politician Patrick Daniel Monaghan., "everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their " Much of what we hear from the opponents of same-sex marriage is opinion masquerading asz fact so they can take the logical step of insisting that their position should be imposed on everyone else. Many honourable members on all sides of the House would testify to the huge post bags that we have all received on this subject from both sides of the  I should say, large number of emails. I would like to challenge in particular two assertions that opponents like to pose as facts. That same-sex marriage is a redefinition of  That this is not about  The definition of marriage has been changed by the state over time and so it is not correct to suggest that marriage has not changed. In fact, legislation around marriage has rightly changed over the years to keep up with public attitudes. From the beginning of real state involvement in marriage in the 1750s to the introduction of non- religious civil marriages to allowing married women to own properties in the 1 80s to outlawing rape within marriage in  The remarriage of divorcees is now allowed. Since the passing of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 it's possible for a trance person to marry in their prefered  This is not about redefining marriage, but extending it to a category of people who are already eligible to enter into marriage as the result of the introduction and broad acceptance of civil partnerships. 80% of adults under the age of 50 in the UK now support same-sex marriage legislation, including three in five people who describe themselves as having religious faith. If I could turn to equality. Much progress has been made in fighting discrimination in the last few  I'm proud of the fact that Labour was in the driving seat for so much of that. I know that is fragile because of the backlash we are seeing against the Equality Act  We need to keep up the momentum in this and same-sex marriage is an important next step  Opponents of same-sex marriage have become adapt at adopting the language and arguments of the Equality Agenda justify diversity under law. However, no matter how they dress it up, such distinction is discrimination. While discrimination provides a powerful case for this change, the growing public support I referred to earlier gives the best possible context for delivering it. In  I don't share the view -- of some that marriage is so vital we should support if for that reason alone.Thank you. Throughout all the debates and controversies surrounding same-sex marriage  recognition of the purpose and values of marriage has been assumed rather than discussed. No real debate has taken place on the nature of marriage itself. Every email and every letter that I have received in support of this Bill has mentioned the world " as a mentioned earlier, it is interesting to note that the word "equal" has been dropped from the title of this Bill by the A Bill which does not change the meaning of adultery if a person in a same-sex marriage has an affair with someone from an opposite sex it's deemed as adultery. If they have an affair with someone of the same-sex it's not classed as adultery and not grounds for  How is that equal? A Bill which takes away the meaning of the purpose of marriage whose intention is traditional child-centred and tailor it is to become a partnership model changes the basic building block of society and makes it adult-centred. How is is it that equal for children? Why isn't this Bill offering civil partnerships for heterosexual couples as well as  traditional marriage is under threat and it has been for so  The steady erosion of marriage over the last few decades is a grave social and economic ill. Why then does the state want to undermine it even further? Surely with around 50% of our children in our society being born out of  shouldn't the state be looking at ways to strengthen the institution of marriage for the sake of children rather than erode the true purpose of marriage even further? There's a plethora of evidence that says the best platform to tackle poverty,  socialism and a place in society already prepared for children that is born is about parental sacrifice. And the love of their children from their union. Basically the traditional family unit seemed by traditional marriage. Those who advocate the extension of marriage to same sex couples have been strong on the value of  but at the same time almost silent on the specific nature of marriage they want equal  Rather than erode the traditional Americaning of marriage to the majority there's a simple solution to this Bill, is divisive rather than being inclusive. Why don't the Government have a serious look at opening up civil partnerships to homosexual couples and simply change the name to something like state marriage? That way those who want marriage so they can be called married get their way. And those who want to maintain marriage for its true intended purpose can keep it too. Those who don't want an option of marriage can have a marriage under civil partnership or state marriage where they currently cannot. And those who believe the church should be the ones to decide whom they should marry could do so. Let the churches and themselves decide not the state in a fashion where they fear reprisals for doing. So in the meantime I will not be supporting this Bill and I will urge any of my colleagues to do the same. It's a huge privilege to speak in this historic debate. I have to be  when I was a first-time candidate in the mid 1990s I was rather concerned about the plans then for lesbian and gay couples being able to adopt. This wasn't because I thought their parenting would be inferior to those of straight couples. I don't and  But because I feared that the social climate of that time would have meant that many of those children might have been suggested to serious bullying. Today happily we live in a different world. It is 80 years since the introduction of civil partnerships and -- it is  And two years since the bar on certainlyies were --  As a straight woman of the Christian faith I cannot believe it is right I can be married in a church and people of no faith should. Yet people who are lesbian or gay are not only shunned by the civil law, but they are barred from performing one of the most fundamental sacramental and pastoral duties. Do honourable members really believe that they should seriously say to a Quaker couple whose meeting house wishes to perform a religious ceremony that they should be able to do so. Or the same for liberal Jews and  Or what about the United Reform Church who brought in religious ceremonies for civil partnerships last year.

For Heaven sake  let's support this Bill.

I agree with  We've heard the Government has no mandate in the manifesto and that is also true. I also think that although it clear that public opinion at the moment in many opinion polls seem to support the  there is no settled public  This is a new debate. It hasn't been conducted for long inside this House or outside. I think more time is needed for people to consider the ramifications of it. Too often outside this House Mr Deputy Speaker the argument on this issue has been polarised. There've been those in favour of same sex marriage who've sought to suggest that all of those who mayo pose it are dinosaurs, and there have been those who oppose it who think that those who support same sex marriage would bring about the end of civil  My honourable friend from  I don't think either of those propositions true. There's been a great deal of common ground in contributions on both sides of  It seems to me the core question for most members with which we are tussling is the balance between the rights of those who may wish to enter same sex marriages and the threat to religious freedoms for others. In  I voted in favour of an equal age of consent. There are only 13 other Conservative members of Parliament who did at that time  I supported civil partnerships in this House. Though I wanted it to be wider and to include other cohabiting couples. Both I thought righted an injustice. This measure does not. It won't save anyone from prosecution for what they are. It won't prevent any inFirst World War inheritance taxes being applied. I will vote against this measure tonight not because I think the world will end if we see  but because I have serious misgivings. That in spite of the Minister's commendable  recognised by the Church of England as has been commented earlier in the debate, it is impossible to guarantee that religious freedom will not be  We've heard many members already in the debate raise instance where is people's employment or right of free expression might be compromised if the European Court were to rule in a certain way or if some of our domestic laws were employed against  The question put to my right honourable friend at the beginning of the debate but the honourable gentleman for Gorton was met with no guarantee that the Secretary of State could give. She couldn't give a guarantee that people would be protected and their religious freedom would be protected, because it is impossible to guarantee it. It could be taken to the European  and if we passed this measure it will be taken to the European Court. I want to set out misgivings about this Bill. I'm not going to vote against it tonight, because I don't object to it being scrutinised by committee, but I do expect to vote against it at third  My honourable friend the Member for Rhondda has spoken of the Church of England marriage service and he's been right to do  Not on the basis that if the Church of England says it, it must  but on the basis that the Church of England was the custodian of marriage in Britain for hundreds  and for many people it  Can I point out the Church of England has never been the custodian in Scotland? My honourable friend is absolutely  But the 1662 version of the Church of England service in use for the past 351 years sets out three reasons for marriage. The first of which is, it was ordained for the procreation of children to be brought up in the fear and enough your of the Lord. The central problem of this Bill, it  is that it introduce as definition of marriage which comprises numbers two and three from that list but it drops number  The result is something a good deal William Hagueer than the The honourable gentleman was at my wedding and I was not young when I got married. And unless I was blessed like Elizabeth it was highly unlikely that I was going to be able, after all that  procreate. Is he telling me that my marriage is less valid than anybody else's? No, Madam Deputy Speaker I certainly am not. I was delighted to attend my honourable friend's wedding. But that was the case 351 years ago as well. The Church of England service applied. But children are at the heart of  As my right honourable friend for Oldham said, they are barely mentioned in the bill. The bill aims to open up the benefits to people excluded from it at the  but it is at the price of taking away a significant part of its meaning. Children are the reason marriage has always been so  If it was purely about a loving relationship between two people in the way the second said at the beginning of the debate, it would've been much less important than it has been. Does that matter, Mr Deputy Speaker? I think it does. It is right for society to recognise as marriage does the value to all of us of the contribution to those who bring children into the world and then bring them up as well. That is the tkwhral the current definition of marriage reflects. It will I think be a mistake to lose the value which that places on the creation and bring up of children. In the  it will be children who lose out if we do. Following the honourable gentleman's argument about the importance of marriage  Is he suggesting that perhaps children should only be adopted by couples who are married? Or that somehow children who are within a same sex parentage have a lesser right to have loving moots are married? No, I'm not saying either of those things. I'm simply making the point that remains the ideal for the two parents who together have created a child to bring that child up. Legal equality was delivered quite rightly by the introduction of civil partnerships. If there are weaknesses in those arrangements they should be put right. In  I see no problem with same sex unions being celebrated in places of worship where congregations want to do so. A same sex couple can have the same wish to affirm and to have affirmed a life-long exclusive commitment as a man and woman getting married. We should value that and be willing to recognise and to celebrate it. But this bill doesn't affirm that same sex unions are equal with marriage. Rather than that they are the same  when in reality they  They are different. I do think we'll be poorer if we adopt a watered down definition of marriage based on two aims from the Church of England's list instead of all  I think, by its very introduction, this bill has now undermined the perception of civil partnerships that were so widely celebrated only a few years ago. I understand many younger people are not bothered by this bill, but many older people do not understand this Government's imperative to change the law in this area. There may be a case for examining any legal disadvantages that exist for same-  and strengthening any weaknesss in the civil partnerships  This legislation was not in our manifesto. It was not in the coalition agreement. It was not in the Queen's Speech. It should not have been introduced before a much fuller discussion had taken  particularly, I believe, within my own party. I give way. Why the Prime Minister specifically referred to not introducing it only just before an election? Mr Deputy  I think there has been many conflicting messages coming out of government, I think that the honourable lady has just eluded to one of them. At a meeting I attended in the House of Lords only a few weeks ago with the then new Archbishop of Canterbury, one of the Bishops actually told us that the Church had not been fully  I believe, only a few  the Church should have been fully involved in all discussions on this matter.

Would she accept that for some of us, it's not exactly ideal we may having to find yourselves abstain by while what we are debating has been mer hasn't been made conclusively.

Having listened carefully to the representations from constituents I will vote for equal marriage today. I will do so because I'm a  not inspite of. It I believe marriage is important. I do believe it should be taken  more seriously certainly than we see in the modern celebrity culture today.

I do not believe a case has been made as to why the honour and privileges of marriage should not be extended to  Some of the emails I have received ask what protection will be given to those people who disagree? I genuinely don't see anything that people will need protecting from. Another concern relates to the role of teachers in Catholic schools. I believe the Education Secretary has provided adequate reassurance on this. I would say that what I hope we can all agree on is what schools should be doing is working to tackle  This should be the starting point for the discussion around these issues in schools. Some people have raised the prospects of marriage between three or more people if this change goes  This objection is one that I do find quite offensive. Comments like this degrade the loving relationships of many in of my constituents and are a poor contribution to this debate.

The majority have been cordiale a number have displayed ver Val from those supposed to be upholding Christian values.

There is no future in this narrow unwelcoming world  We have reconciled many literal interpretations of scriptures with modern life, we can do so again. One of the more philosophical arguments I have received is that marriage belongs to the church and not the state much I don't believe this is true. I believe many of the changes over the years did strengthen marriage despite claims at the time to the  They include registry  weddings outside of religious venues. Many of these changes opened up the honour of marriage to a wider circle of people and should be commended for  Isn't it the case the way this law is drafted it protects the church's view on marriage and indeed protects those within the church that hold that view strongly to be able to continue to do so without fear of retribution? I completely agree. I know with our constituencies being neighbouring ones the representations he would have received would be very much the same of mieb mine. We can reassure people and celebrate this change as being welcomed. I feel strongly that the majority of my constituents favour this change. It is only on principle that any MP can vote on this matter. It is my firm view this change is right. That this change promotes the cause  That this change will strengthen marriage and this is a change that deserves our respect and support today. On the weekend,  I went to the opening of an exhibition in Bristol's Museum entitled Out Stories, the  lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Bristol over the last half century. It believes with the story of Oliver who in 1963 was found guilty of gross indecency and sentenced to three months in prison or £40 fine. It goes to the trial and tribulations of history over the last half century the ups and downs and how the experiences of gay people in Bristol in that period have changed. It's not just interesting in the  it makes you think about your own place in history. For me that was rather easy because I'm mentioned in that exhibition as the first openingly gay member of Parliament to serve my city, indeed the first on these benches as well. I was born in 1966, when homosexuality was still without the law and was a criminal offence. Throughout my life, while we have seen much progress, that progress has come in fits and starts and has not always been easy. Throughout my teenage years and my years at  being openingly gay was virtually impossible because occasionally it was a terrifying identity to have as an individual, in terms of the abuse I received myself and the far worse that I saw being meted out to other people at school and university. What I would say to colleagues on all sides who are opposing what we are trying to achieve today is, please, have some empathy for what you're fellow citizens have been through. Equality is not something that can be delivered partially. Equality is  Now, since 1994 when the age of consent was lowered to 18, we have had rapid change.

It has been characterised by the difference -- differences between the religion and state. Marriage is not the sole property of any faith or doe nomination. It has always been regulated by civic society. The mat ro moanal causes act that allowed women to divorce their husbands was rather more radical in the times than it was debated than what we are contemplating today. It was opposed by Gld -- Gladstone. On the politics of what we are doing  I would like to thank my honourable friend the member for Hornsey who did so much to bring this legislation to light. Also, I would like to thank members from all parties who are doing their bit today to do the right thing. Much of what we do in this chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker, ends up being (inaudible) in history. What we are doing today will be remembered for  It will bring genuine change in our country. Tonight, what we do will be looked upon kindly by history. It's a great pleasure to follow the honourable member who spoke powerfully from his own experience. I am going to vote for second reading of the bill tonight because I believe it is right to give all committed loving partnerships the same legal status.  I do think the bill bears all the hallmarks of a rushed job. The Government's confusion, for  between marriage and a wedding is clear in the notes which  "marriage law in England and Wales is based on where the ceremony takes place." Surely, this is complete misunderstanding of what marriage is all about? I have two main concerns, which I hope will be addressed in committee before the Government brings the bill back for its third reading. First of all, I do not want us to back the Church of England into disestablishment. The reason the Church of England, unlike the other  needs special mention is not to introduce a new hurdle, but to reflect its position as the established church. Anyone and everyone who resides in a parish has the right to marry and be married in their parish church. Canon Law which embodies the teaching of the church is also part of the law of England. The Church  however regrettable, some honourable members may feel  is not in the foreseeable going to change its teaching on  This stat Ute needs to reflect that position if the Church of England is not going to be subject to successful legal  To put it another way. We need to balance people's rights under Articles 123 and 14 to -- 12 and 14 to marry against the Bill doesn't go far enough. The Government says it wants to treat all marriages the same way, but schedule 4 Part 3 exempts same sex marriages from rules on consummation and adultery. I guess consummation won't be a big problem, but surely if sexual fidelity is central to homosexual marriages, it should be central to any and all  Why is the Bill fixating on the biological homosexual intercourse? A similar issue arises in the way the bill is setting out the rights of children born to lesbian mothers. Surely children born to lesbian mothers should have the same rights to two parents as other children. The presumption should be that a married lesbian couple are both parents of that child if one of them has a baby. I hope this is something that honourable members will look at. I hope they will also look at the rights of children adopted by gay  Finally, I want to say something about the trans community, often overlooked. I welcome the provision in the Bill that will not require them to annul their marriages in order to have their gender reassigned. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. I thought long and hard about seeking to speak in this debate. I genuinely feared the tone of the debate and how colleagues would seek to oppose the Bill. So when colleagues talked about gay marriage making them physically sick or when colleagues suggest it was a step towards legalising polygamy or incest... Will the honourable gentleman give way? No,  People's lives are involved and we should remember that the words spoken in this chamber hurt far beyond this chamber when we speak. Mr Deputy  when I was elected to this House in May 2010, it was perhaps the proudest day of my life. I should point out it was the second proudest day of my life, because the proutest day was when I entered into -- proudest day was when I entered into my civil partnership with my partner of 21 years. Our civil partnership was a huge step forward for us and yet many argue that we should be content with our civil partnership. After all, it affords all the same legal protections as marriage. But I asked my married colleagues, but get married for legal protections it afforded you? Did you go down on one knee and say, "Darling, please give me the protections that marriage affords us?" of course you  My civil partnership was our way of saying to my friends and  this is who I love. This  This is who I wish to spend the rest of my life with. Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm not asking for special treatment. I'm simply asking for equal treatment. Mr Deputy Speaker, people have talked about dissent and division and the heat of the debate. But sometimes leadership is about doing what's  Not what's popular, and I congratulate the Prime Minister on leading on this. This issue has caused anxiety amongst colleagues and amongst constituents. Some argue that it is not the right time, and yet no-one's been able to explain to me what the right time  So if not today, when? Monday? Next week? Next year? For me it's the right time and we should simply get on with it. Mr Deputy Speaker, so much of our time in this House is spent on technical legislation. Today we have an opportunity to do what's right, to  I am a member of this Parliament and I say to my  I is it alongside you in committees. In the bars and in the tea rooms.

Pension rights weren't available to surviving  And discrimination in property and inheritance issues was  Civil partnerships recognised same sex relationships and I'm proud it was a Labour Government with all-party support that passed that legislation through this House of Commons. Legislation isn't built on sentiment Mr Deputy Speaker it is built on fact. I have to say to members across the whole House, whilst that legislation unquiverically broke the back of unlawful discrimination, this proposal doesn't end any discrimination whatsoever. It has to potential to ep up a can of worms of Olympian magnitude. I am also bitterly disappointed about the manner in which people's genuine concerns have been dismissed by Government Ministers. Logic has been responded to with  There's been no greater offender of that than the Secretary  I want to ensure that my views were recorded in this debate, because I don't agree with comments from people who are clearly steeped in bigotry and hatred. My concerns are that this Bill, should it  will give no new rights to any same sex couples in England  It's a complete fabrication to suggest that it is about equality. Indeed if you read Stonewall's briefing on this matter, there is no information in there about new rights. Secondly, I believe that the state should have no role in marriage. Any couple should have access to civil partnerships or unions. If this is truly about changing definitions and setting them into law, for goodness sake do it properly. Allow the state to treat all people equally and allow equal access to all mechanisms of the state. By  we would eliminate the controversy which arises when we start to use the same terminology  That brings me to my third reason for opposing this Bill. On 11 December the Secretary of State said I know many honourable members are worried that (Inaudible) conduct same sex marriages. Not excuse for misunderstanding the facts. Case law of the European Court of Human Rights and rights set out on the European Convention on Human Rights puts protection of religious belief beyond doubt. The Government's legal position is confirmed that with appropriate legislative drafting there is no challenge through the European courts as negligible. Would he confirm whether he knows of any case in any of the other European Union countries where same sex marriages are already allowed where there's been a prosecution of someone for holding the view that same sex marriage should not be allowed? I'm going to come on to that point  The much-vaunted quadruple lock is underpinned by  What we all know in this House is what makes case law is  I'm damned sure, as sure as the sun rises in the morning, that a same sex couple will go to a church or a synagogue. They will make a demand to be married that. Demand will be refused and they will go to a court. They in turn will have to wait and see in turn what new case law is created. By  Mr Deputy Speaker, none of us may be serving in this House. We may have left politics altogether or we may have left this  But people will look back in that set of circumstances and say this. How did we get into this mess? And they will look back in Hansard and say it is because we made a bad law in 2013. Some politicians said at the time there was a quadruple lock underpinned by  But if we project forward into the future, is it not also the case that some churches may settle changed their mind in the way they have over the blessing of civil partnerships and the way that clearly even parts of the Church of  certainly the parts of the church of Wales, have express to do so desire to go further than this legislation allows. Society will evolve but so also will the churches' views.That may be the  but under my proposition, which separates a recognition of unions and partnerships by the state and partnerships that churches recognise, would make sure there was no confusion between state and church and therefore it would be a clear distinction in the  That's why I'm upset about what proposed today. When we do look back and because the quadruple lock which is proposed has been put forward by the Secretary of State is to be supported by case law, I'm afraid you have to reach the conclusion if case law changes, the opportunities, the argument the Secretary of State is making actually falls. So, in terms of my  when I came into  I made a personal vow I would never vote knowingly for a poor Bill or a poor piece of  I may unintentionally do that in my time in this place but not when I know that what's in front of me is a poorly constructed Bill which in turn could become a poorly constructed law. That's why I will be voting against this Bill on second reading. It's a great pleasure to follow the Member for East Kilbride. His very last point when he said you should never vote for something which you know is a  What a statement for Parliament and patientarians. It's a sad day for me. It is my saddest day as a member of this House, when my party brings in a Bill which I'm fundamentally opposed to. I personally believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that's my belief. I'm very sad that my party has brought this in without any democratic mandate. I'm not going to address the issues of whether it is right for gay marriage or wrong for gay marriage. Members across the House are making these points very well. I just want to deal with the specific point of the democratic dech is it. I think that's what Parliament -- deficit. I think that's what Parliament should be concerned about. I've listened to a lot of the short speeches made tonight. I listened to the honourable lady for Bishop  She started to make some interesting points but the time limit stopped her from developing the argument. The first democratic deficit is we are having a second reading debate for one day only. Members are reduced to four minutes. Many members won't get in. It would've been much better if we had this over two days. I hope the leader of the House towards the end of the debate will rise and suggest that this debate is adjourned and we have another day, so that all members can get in on what's a very important point. Would my honourable friend sum up the conundrum by saying it's the tyranny of the usual channel which is are destroying the opportunity to have a two-day debate, because the frontbenchs are in support of the Bill and the backbenches are left out on their own?The suggestion that I could ever criticise either whips department is outrageous. The problem we have is that Parliament doesn't decide the timetable. It is the executive that does it. On that point?If I  Does he agree with me that it is a breach of precedent that an issue of conscience brought to this House into second reading such as the Hunting Bill or the human fertilisation or embryology Bill would be held on the floor of the  to give an opportunity to showcase Parliament and have a mature debate about crucial issues? I'm grateful for his intervention  I will if I have time deal with that very important point. I want to roll back the clock a bit to the last general election. I have the three manifestos here. The  the best one, the invitation to join the Government of Britain, a Conservative one. The Liberal Democrat change that works for you. And Labour's a future fair for all. I also have the coalition, our programme for Government. I've read all of these again and they make interesting reading. But they don't deal anywhere with the question of gay marriage or same sex marriage. Not even hinted at. The coalition agreement has 35  The invitation to join the  119, a future fair for  77, and the Liberal Democrats,  340 pages of promises, not anything about gay marriage. And that is where I think there's a huge democratic deficit. When voters went to the polls, they didn't vote for candidates on the basis that this was an issue or this was a pledge of their party. There was no suggestion whatsoever. That is slightly misleading, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I vaguely  and we were all working  but the weekend or so before the general election there was a slight hoo-ha in the press, that the Conservatives were going to bring in gay marriage. I thought  that can't be right. Thankfully my leader got up and help had an interview with wing it was Adam Bolton on Sky Television. When asked where the Conservatives planning to bring in gay marriage,  "I'm not planning that." We had it not in anyone's manifesto. The leader of my party saying it was not going be brought in. And we find two years later we are having Why should all of us decide how this matter is determined? Why is  or the leader of my party, any more important than the person in the Dog and Duck, they haven't had a chance to express their view. I want other members to have a chance to get in. My simple solution so this problem and the Prime Minister has already done  I hate to bring the EU into  but he has gone for a referendum on a very, very important issue. It seems to me tonight the whole of these benches could be united and those as well if the Minister, having listened to this debate says, "I recognise this is a matter of conscience. I want to put this to the British people. We are going to have an in-out referendum on the EU in 2017, why don't we put this off to 2017 a and then all of the nation can decide  not just us 600 people here "Thank you, Mr Deputy  I apologise for missing part of the debate, I have been in a Public Bill Committee. I want to vote for the bill at second reading because I think, I have thought long and hard about, this I have listened to a lot of people in my constituency, but I think the principle is right iesm don't think it can be fair in this day and age that some of us enjoy a right and a privilege and deny it to others. I assume on that basis the vast majority of the House will support  but I hope for that reason the Secretary of State will concentrate on three matters. She won't convince people who are totally opposed to it. I don't think that is possible. I think she should think again about confining this simply to civil marriage. I don't think it is in our interests to make any judgments about the church or other faiths, whatever  I think it would be much  I think it would be much marriage as they see fit and offer marriage as they see fit and offer  Neither the Prime Minister nor any other party leader has a mandate since it was not in any party's manifesto let alone in the coalition agreement. My honourable friend the Prime Minister insisted on sticking to the oversea aid on the grounds he gave a commitment in  I respect him for. That he has struck to that commitment not to the commitment to introduce tax breaks for married couples. He is now invented a policy which he specifically ruled out at the last general election. I'm grateful. Does my honourable friend think the least that should have done is we should have had a draft bill with pre-legislative scrutiny?  This goes to the heart of the point as Conservatives we are cautious about constitutional  but not this administration. Sweeping Lords reform, major change in the law of success now this bill to be rushed through on a timetable motion supblt fo a three-line whip. This is no way to treat Parliament or colleagues who have strong convictions either way on what is a very sensitive and important issue to all of us and our constituents.  if there is no mandate, why -- where is this demand for this change? The Daily Mail found .. The Daily Mail, found that only one in 14, that is 7% of those questioned, thought there should be a priority. Another poll found over 60% of the black and minority ethnic communities, the very people this party is apparently out to woe, are hostile.  I give way. I think my honourable friend. Majority population apparently don't care very much about what we're talking  Those people that do  in my constituency, have written to me in huge numbers  please, oppose it. Far greater those people who will be rejoicing if it is passed. Would you agree with me on that Yes, I do agree with my honourable friend that overwhelminging letters and emails I received are asking me to oppose this legislation. The public does not understand the full ramifications of what will flow from this legislation if it is  Fourthly, there is already provision for civil partnerships which provides most of the benefits  To those in the gay  Those of us who had reservations at the time were reassured that the introduction of civil partnerships should not be seen as the forerunner of today's  A noble lord said in 2004, "I want to put our position very  this is a new legal status that gives rights and responsibilities to people in same- sex committed relationships, we do not see it as an analysis to  We do not see it as a drift towards gay marriage."  those behind today's proposal feel no sense of obligation arising from the clear assurances given ten years ago. How can we be sure this will be the end of this process or whether there will be more? Fifthly, what about the consequences? Take education, the department states grandly that, "no teacher will be required to promote or endorse views that go against their beliefs." the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport doing a job in difficult circumstances said on the K today programme, "there will be no requirement on teachers to promote same-sex marriage. Obviously we wouldn't expect teachers to be offensive or discriminate in anyway about " What guidance does that give teachers in our country who have a profound objection to other -- proclaiming other than traditional marriage? John Bowers pointed out there is no protection. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not a Tory moderniser for... No, I, for I believe marriage can only be between a man and a woman. I do not - I shall not surrender my  I believe this bill is  It is opposed by the church. There is no mandate for it. There are huge potential consequences. Not least the prospect of endless legal challenge and the nation faces serious challenges which the Government needs to address. I hope and pray this measure will be  if not in this place, in the other place. Mr Departmenty  I truly hope that one day in the future we will live in a truly equal society. In which there is either little or no discrimination. I don't believe this is a utopian dream. I believe this is a possibility. I think we have still got a very, very long  The introduction of equal marriage and the bill before us today is an -- a step in that journey towards that equal society.

It's one we should hear more. Would she not agree with me it would be good practice to extend the debate to 10pm tonight. Is she aware of any mechanism this could be done?

We should be proud it was honourable members and right honourable members of this house past and present who tackle the injustice that I have set out. I'm proud that it was the Labour government who did so much in this Some of the arguments we heard that they are the same as we are hearing  The first argument is that this Bill will somehow we Kennedy Institute of marriage. This argument is simply illogical. On  allowing more couples to enter into marriage I think this will strengthen the institution of  not weaken it. There are many countries in Europe around the World's that have introduced a gay  It has not weakened or undermined marriage in those  quite the contrary. The second argument is that equal marriage would threaten the freedom  Again I would refute this argument. I wholeheartedly was support the freedom of religion but on the face of this Bill there are Witton guarantees that neither a religious institution organisation -- were written guarantees, nor a religious minister would be forced to marry same-sex couples.. Many European and countries who are members of the Council of Europe have already introduced same-sex  some as early as 2001 in the case of are the Netherlands and it has also been introduced more recently in Denmark, Sweden and  They have managed to introduce same-sex marriage whilst at the same time protecting religious freedom and that has already been stated. There has been no successful case brought between the European Court of European human rights. The freedom of religion goes both ways. It is also right to protect and promote to the freedom of those religious organisations who want to conduct the marriage of same-sex couples. The Quakers, liberal Jews and libertarians have all expressed the desire to conduct those marriages and I think that the state and the law should not stand in the way of  I know there is a very light debate in the Church of England but I am very concerned about this. -- lie youth debate. I spoke to someone this morning who would very much like to marry same-sex couples in his church and at the bill -- as the Bill currently stands that would not be possible.

Their love is no less significant and no less  I passionately believe that it is time that the law recommended -- recognised this fact.

I shall be voting against his bail because I am a Conservative and because I know that the overwhelming number of my constituents who are also against this Bill. I have had three letters in support of his bail. That reflect the opinion within the  The opponents of this Bill are under one fundamental misconception and that is that the man and women are equal before the law and therefore they are the same. They are not the same. Men and women are different. They may be equal before the law but we cannot force them into a marriage when we have a marriage which is set at at the moment on the basis it is between a man and a woman. As the President of the Family Division  the common-law definition of marriage is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others. We ignore that fact at our peril. My honourable friend raises a good  The constituency postbag of which many of us had a. Has he actually looked at the age profile of the people writing interim?  like most of us, it is those people who tend to be much older that are most a rage when  I have five children. If any of my children thought that I was actually going to oppose this Bill they would think I was bonkers. People under 40, the vast majority of people under 40 I am afraid support this Bill. We must have short interventions on the grounds they everyone wants to contribute so it is important we get everybody's was. I cannot answer for my honourable friend's constituents but I know I have the highest proportion of elderly constituents than any constituency in the country and I have put that  These proposals were not in my manifesto or the Coalition agreement and the Prime Minister expressing roll them out for three days before the general election. In 2000 and thought I was a in a -- I was a member of the Standing Committee on the civil partnerships  I led 89 divisions in that Standing Committee. I argued then and I argue now that we should be giving a status to the civil partnerships which is the same for both men and women. It is interesting that in the course of this debate a number of honourable member will both sides have said that they think that civil partnerships should be extended to had a sexual as well as Thomas  I raised this with the Prime Minister at a meeting the best part of two years ago and he told me that he is against it. He put it like this, he is against all marriage lite arrangements. If that remains is the year it is not reflected in the Bill before us because the logic of his view is that we should exclude civil partnerships and the Bill should be amended to delay it so partnerships in the future, obviously while allowing existing civil partnerships to carry on. The alternative is to allow civil partnerships for both men and women. If we allow civil partnerships for  then the Bill will not be so likely to be challenged in the European Court of Human Rights. I think that if we leave a situation where civil partnerships are only available to same-sex couples at the same time as getting those same-sex couples access to marriage we will not be able to argue a case in the European Court of Human Rights against the  I think that where we should be doing -- what we should be doing his discussing this Bill in detail in committee and submitting it to pre-legislative  That is why I shall be voting against the timetable motion and I shall also be voting against the carry over motion. What is an obscenity is that the Government persuaded this House to introduce carry over motions as a standard form of a standard order on the basis that we would then be able to carry over bills that had a first been introduced in the form of a draft bill and then subject to priest registered scrutiny -- pre- legislative scrutiny and then put together as a bill and what is now happening is that the Government is now or not having a draft bill, not even having pre-legislative scrutiny but is trying to push the bill through very quickly because they see it as embarrassing. Does my honourable friend not also think it is quite outrageous that the committee stage is not being taken on the floor of the House. Any measure of this controversy of this sort of sensitivity should be taken on the floor of the coups -- on the floor of the House. Absolutely. We should also have had a two days for the second reading debate. I am at odds with the Prime Minister on this issue but there is no reason why I should be at odds on the Prime Minister on issues of procedure and process. If the Prime Minister is really interested in the primacy of this chamber and does not want all of our legislation to go in piecemeal form to the other place, why will he not agree to having a longer discussion over this Bill? This Bill could be brought forward as a fresh bail at the beginning of the next session and the time between now and they could be spent on having proper scrutiny of it. We have not heard from the Joint Committee on Human Rights which gave some very important advice when we were discussing civil partnerships. We have not heard from other select committees because it is being rushed through. The consequence of that is that when it gets to the  the Other Place will give it a pretty bloody nose. In a following the honourable member for Christchurch, I can say that I agree with him on the principle of equality in terms of civil partnerships. I think it is remiss and it would be a dereliction of this Parliament in the context of  not to afford equality and civil partnerships and I regret the terms in which the Secretary of State talked down so well partnerships in her opening  just as the Prime Minister has. There will be many gay people who will still not possible partnerships. They will not opt for a civil marriage for their own reasons. It is how they maintain their relationship their own faith and may be how they maintain their relationship with maintain their relationship with the partner. They may want to maintain a particular relationship with a church owl their family or their partner from a previous  All equality should be  That is why I am supporting this second Reith -- second reading. I believe that all equality and equal and it should stand for several partnerships as well as  When this Bill was first  it was as a civil marriage equality bill and on that basis I committed to the supporting  I will still supported in the second reading on that basis although its terms have widened. The terms in which it has widened has allowed some of the misgivings that many people have an added to the sense that it is a thin end of the wedge and a slippery slope, etc. Even though I understand and share and sympathise with some of those  I will reflect that by opposing the programme motion. I would urge all honourable members who have spoken in favour of second reading but has said there are issues they would like to see addressed at the committee stage, if they want to be honest and honourable with those things, they should not been good conscience accept the whip to vote for the programme motion, they should vote against the programme motion. My support for the second reading is because I care for the principle of this Bill but as a legislator I have to observe the principle of legislative care and the time that we have been given to discuss the  with us all having to sound bite our way through this debate with four minutes each is  I don't know how we can discharge our responsibility for legislative care there. Many people have rightly said that the restrictions that have been there on the right to marriage should  That is what people should  marriage has not changed but restrictions on the rights within marriage have changed. It has been legislators that have had to lead the way there and churches have been somewhat fearful. I, of  and someone of her faith. I am proud of my marriage and that it was ritually founded. I do not believe that that is the only form of marriage that anybody should be entitled to. My sense of my strength of my marriage and his qualities will not be diminished by marriage being available to anybody  whether in a civil theatre or in another church. I believe that we can look forward to say that we can achieve equality, we can legislate for equality in the course of this Bill but we need to address the serious issues. Churches appear to be treating -- treated differently. Some churches are named and mentioned in the Bill but others are told they just have to be content with a reading of the  I do not -- I will be voting for equality just as I was one of only 38 that voted for equality last week in relation to the Crown succession Bill. I am very disappointed to have to rise to oppose this Bill this afternoon. I never imagined that I would be put in a position where I have, by virtue of standing up for marriage, been characterised variously as a homophobic bigot, as a religious  as a product of the dark  or, I see this weekend in the  on the brink of making a tragic mistake which I will have many years to regret. This legislation was not something we had in our main manifesto. To cite that it was on page 14 of the qualities contracts, is a manifesto which had little or no public scrutiny is disingenuous at best. My concern this afternoon is to uphold marriage. I speak not just from personal religious interest, though I am saddened that I feel it necessary to have to state that I have any sentiments of a homophobic nature in May, and I hope my friends who are gay would stand up Thank you for that intervention. That is most regrettable. The assumption of this bill is that marriage is just about love and  Marriage is about love and commitment. Marriage is also about compliment arity both biological and a man and a woman, with procreation and raising children within that institution. As a supporter of the Prime Minister and his, I won't have sufficient time, and his leadership  very difficult times, I have tried very hard to reconcile myself to his view on this matter. I just can't see how any government can automatically confirm marriage on somebody through passing a law without changing the nature of what marriage means. It will lead, I  to legislative anomalies and undermine the recognised obligations and norms that sustain and underpin marriage as an institution. The Government themselves have recognised, in the text of the Bill, that inevitably there will be important distinctions between same-sex and opposite sex marriage. The Bill is clear that adultery and con summation will only apply to opposite sex marriages. In the Stonewall briefings these concepts are seen as archaic requirements. Opening up a whole new area of  confusion and differences within the same new proposed definition of marriage. For those heterosexual couples who marry, the concepts of con summation and adultery will remain. Yet for the same-sex couples who take up this proposed provision, they will not  This ludicrous situation underscores why the wise provision of civil partnerships of nearly a decade ago were made. To ensure that same-sex couples could make an equally valid commitment in law, receiving all the legal rights and privileges conifered by marriage, but it would have to remain different in name. By a factor of at least 30-1 my constituents have expressed their opposition to this. Those who are in indifferent or in favour of change are unlikely to change their vote over. It the level of disappointment of a much large ermine yort, as witnessed by 000, who have signed the kolgs for marriage petition, is keenly felt and -- Coalition for Marriage petition is keenly felt and will be a highly motivated electoral minority in future  I have stood up against homophobic bullying, no, I won't, and prejudice all my political life. I have to say, the language used by some Christians is unfortunately  I want to put on record my abhorance at some of the representations I have received. Homophobia can never be condoned. Re-defining marriage is the wrong way to tackle prejudice. Huge numbers of Conservative supporters feel grave disappointment and alien nation at the decision to pursue this legislation. Government will say that they are strengthening marriage by widening it. In  they are redefining it. In redefining it, they are undermining it. If the Government want to strengthen marriage, I respectfully submit they should leave it alone. Mr Deputy Speaker, can I say to the Minister I was the Minister who took through the Gender Recognition Bill although there will be much noise and fire,  she will look back on this moment with great flied her career. The measure of a civilised democracy is how we treat  It is important that we remember those who served on the report half a century ago and those, including in my own local authority in Haringey who in the 1980s wanted to fund gay groups. Wanted to see our children understanding these complex issues and faced Clause 2 8hfplt we not passed that Clause we might have come to this moment a little sooner. So, it is to them that we pay tribute, as we move forward in the way that we do. Does he agree with me that it was... It has set back the introduction of Section 28 did set back this debate. If it hadn't have been introduce wed might have come to this point  much earlier? I think my honourable friend is right. That  a great stain on this  where we turned on an important minority. Now, I have received many letters from people for whom this is all coming too  They say that the speed of change for lesbian., gay and bisexual rights is happening too abruptly for them to comprehend. The country they live in, the traditions they live by and the people they live next to are transforming in ways that make them feel uncomfortable, upset and  They are not homophobic  they are not racist, they  not now, later. To some extent I sympathies. As much as I would want Britain to always be the beating party of -- heart of a radical and progressive change, it  At root it has always had a small "c" Conservative spine that runs through. It an instinct that change should always be organic. A need for change to be owned by the people not imposed from up high. We must respect. That I will respect for that when I vote for this bill. It does command the support of the country because it does respect religious freedom and tradition by permitting rather than mandating religious organisations to conduct the ceremonies. Because it is in the end of an organic journey from criminality to equality, for the gay community that begun over a half century ago. This change is  This change is necessary and the time is now. There are still those who say that this is all unnecessary. Why do we need gay marriage when we already have civil partnerships, they say? They are  separate but equal, they  Let me speak frankly.  but equal is a fraud. Separate but equal is the language that tried to push KRosa Parks to the back of the bus. Separate but equal is the mow teev that determined that black-and-white people could not possibly drink from the same water fountain, eat at the same table or use the same  Separate but equal are the words that justified sending black children to different schools from their white peers, schools that would fail them and condemn them to a life of poverty. It is the same  the same ideas and the same delusion that we borrowed in this country to say that women  but only if they were married and only when they were  It is the same naivete that gave way for my dad, being a citizen when he arrived here in  but refused by landlords and proclaimed "no blacks, no Irish, no dogs "requesting.

As long as our statute books suggest that love between two men and or two women is unworthy of being recognise through marriage we allow the rot of homophobia to fester. We entrench a society where 20,000 homophobic crimes take place each year. Where 000 people have witnessed homophobic bullying at work in the last five years. I am a Christian.  I recognise that this is important... May I say it's a privilege for me and all of us in the House to hear this extraordinary and impassioned reading there are Christianes who look for love in every aspects of their lives and the lives of those around them who still feel profound misgivings and concerns about this piece of legislation? Can I say, I totally accept the manner in which my honourable friend put his  It's with deep regret that I have received many letters in my post bag condemning this legislation from people who share the same values and Christian ideal that is I do. I know they resent the fact that those on the extreme of our faiths that poisoned an important debate. Let us use today to return to a discussion of what marriage ought to be about. When I married my wife I understood our marr tiedge have two important  The expression of love, mutality over the core course of our life and a commitment to raise  It is the case that gay men and women can raise children. This House made that decision. Let us not hear this debate about family as if gay men and women cannot do that. The Jesus I know was born a refugee, illegitimate with a death warrant on his name,. That is why this bill is right. I want to thank members for the respect I have felt in this place for my faith-based views. I also thank the many constituents who have written to me of faith and no faith urging me to vote against  Some 95% of those who have writ tonne me have done so. In doing so today therefore I'm confident that my conscience and, in the absence of any other mandate, my constituency representation will  I believe that marriage is a life commitment between a man  For their benefit, for the benefit of their children that they may have, and for the stability of wider society, that no government should redefine it, nor can any government do so in a workable way as this bill shows. Let me explain. The Government say that is no church minister will be forced to hold a same-sex marriage. What of the many people of sincere  lay people who believe marriage between a man and a woman is not something that they wish to support? Will their legal rights be affected? What of the Christian couple who own a heritage hotel registered for civil wed whotion wish to continue holding opposite sex weddings but not same-sex weddings they will, I understand, have no legal defence what so ever against being sued in the courts under the Equality Act in discrimination of goods and  Many other businesses will be similarly affected. It's not correct to say this legislation will have no detrimental effect on religious or other freedoms. What .. I shall give way. Coming to this point about an attack on religious freedoms. The situation in Denmark after they changed the laws has now subjected churches there being forced to conduct same- sex marriages shortly after quarantines were given to them that they would not be forced to conduct such relations. I hear that with interest and hope to comment of  What of the church youth leader or the faith-based charity which put on marriage preparation classes, will they be required to accept same-sex couples or will they have to close their class or organisation? Or will litigation enSue with its stress and costs without the outcome. Will they face the loss of their charitable status or withdraw of local grant because they don't have an acceptable diversity policy. Can anyone guarantee this will not happen as a result of this legislation? Will they decide to stay silence and have that precious right of free speech compromised as a result of this legislation too? What of the legal distinction between the public servant role of the employed registrar and the public function carried out by voluntary registrars appointed by local churches, a part of their  across the country? Will not those voluntary registrars, those lay people, will they really be able to successfully defend discriminations actions in the court if brought against them if they go to Europe if they refuse o officiate at same-sex weddings?

Why should people of good conscience risk ending up in the same The Book of Common Prayer says that one of the three reasons that marriages ordained is for the mutual society and help and comfort that one ought to have all the other both in prosperity and  Why, in Christian  should the state and Christians that want to be able to  or, for that matter, people in ordinary society, just because of their gender? It is very ironic that whilst the Government says it wants to promote commitment under equality, this Bill will not actually create equal marriage, it will create different types of  Most young people aspire to be married, precisely because of the security which the commitment of marriage provides. Adultery with a marriage person of the same sex will not be a concept applicable to same-sex marriages. What message does that send out to our young people today about marriage if faithfulness and commitment are no longer at the heart of it? Far from strengthening marriage and commitment in our society, this Bill risks seriously weakening it. Isn't it the case that the Government has had to put so many locks into this legislation to protect people precisely because it is concerned about one after another they may fail. Before this session of Parliament there are prayers said which include the  may we never lead the nation  I will vote against this legislation tonight because if it is passed today I believe that we will surely do so. I hope that by calling me I can prove to the honourable member of for Braintree that one does not have to be young to be radical. I am sorry that the honourable member for Christ Church has left his place because, as one of the ministers who took through the civil partnership legislation  alongside a Jacqui Smith who was then the at the Department of Trade and Industry which was the lead department in this, I remember every one of those 89 divisions that he provoked. I also want to pay a special tribute at this time to the honourable member from, what's his name, Alan Duncan. Roland! -- Rutland and Melton. I am never sure if it is a cheese or a wine! I think he is an honourable member! In his case it might be both! I want to pay a special tribute to him because he led his troops in opposition to what was a very consensual approach to civil partnership. Let me be under no  those of us who were around at that time will remember that in its own way the Civil partnership legislation was no less controversial than this legislation  Many of the arguments that have been made today are very much the same as they are just now. I remember in fact the accused by the then Labour -- the then Member for Maidstone, Ann Widdecombe, of undermining marriage. As of next week I will have invested 41 years of my life in marriage and I don't think that means I have been undermining it. If the Secretary of State need to seriously consider the concerns that people out there  I do agree that the Bill throws up some of its own questions. I think this echoes the comments made by my honourable friend. She needs to nail down exactly what the protections Arthure Church's other than the established churches. I do not want to face any vicar, any priest any rabbi, and saying I am sorry I got this wrong. I wanted to be right and she needs to give that  I also think that we need to revisit the issue of civil partnerships. In its time that was seen as a step forward. We went forward in unity with the gay community at that time, who wanted to see legal rights established for  however the difficulty with piecemeal legislation, in trying to deal with a strategic issue is that you get piecemeal  I do think that we may be going down that road just now unless the Government, if not in  but certainly as part of a conversation later, needs to think about what we do with civil  I think there was a debate to be had about the separation of secular and religious. We can look at continental countries where we see the only agency of marriage is the state, and all of the religious elements, which I went through myself in my own marriage, can be added on to that initial contract. I will be voting for this Bill tonight. I have had representations, some of  some of them very polite conversations, to ask me to do various things. As a legislature I have to do about it turned -- I have to make a balanced judgment. I say to people here today, this is not a proxy for Europe or leadership contest or anything else, I ask members to vote with their  to do what is right and to win work with her the right  -- walk through the right  I will be generous and give the Government credit for the title  It is about marriage and not about homosexuality. I greatly respect my right honourable friend the honourable member for Arundel and South Downs but I am concerned that this Bill has advocates that I have been hearing across the House today and are, of all people are advocate to a liberal conservative to want to use this Bill as a vehicle to redefine people's use of homosexuality, rather than what this Bill is about, which is to redefine marriage. I have been alongside my right honourable friend from Arundel and the South Downs supporting legislation to tackle homophobic hatred and I have been alongside another honourable member speaking out against homophobic bullying but I will be a different division from those honourable gentleman, in a different lobby because I will be seen to defend a social institution of marriage and we should not convey the two. An underlying message coming across from some on the board Gen -- on a were  the message is that if you are against this Bill you acceding to bigotry and homophobia and that is unacceptable. We are standing positively for the institution of marriage and let no one mistake that. Can I thank my honourable friend for the great way in which he is sincerely putting his arguments and has done. Does he share my view that the reason the Government has to put quadruple locks in the legislation to make sure that no church will be forced into single-sex marriage is because they are worried that these locks will be broken and that the case will be taken to Strasbourg court and churches will be forced against their will to have single-sex marriage? Let us be clear, there have been different things said about the Church of England response but their response to the second reading his this, let us we that the ability of the government to Lake -- make legislation watertight against a challenge in the European courts or against a chilling effect in public discourse. We retain serious doubts about whether claims would prove durable. Too much emphasis we believe is being placed on the personal assurances of Ministers. Can we rely and take the risk on the well intentioned ministers tonight when we have the serious issues of the protection of churches? I believe  The position is well summed up by the chief executive of Stonewall. Soon after the election he said to  this proposal for same-sex  it won't advance gay  what it will do is put us in our trenches. Sadly that has been the case. The vote tonight is on a petition of principle. It is not a practical measure in order to gain equal access to marriage  The vote tonight is about the principle of redefining  the purpose and meaning of marriage, a common law has always defined marriage as a voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all  The state has got involved in refining aspects of marriage but the essential definition and its meaning and purpose, its very  has remained unchanged  It is, indeed, a historic change. Whether the colt in the Bill is presently is that where any clause to clarify what the Government wants us to accept is the new meaning of marriage. A defining characteristic of marriage we know is exclusivity, a commitment to sexual fidelity. The sexual fidelity is taken out of the government's definition of marriage when it comes to same-sex couples being excluded from the definition  We have heard about the issues of children and parents  The Bill is now implying that the state has another meaning of marriage which is primarily about the rights and values of adult it, not the rights and values of  The Secretary of State is singing a new tune of marriage, a one-sided single, All You Need Is  While the Government must now what this means for the institution of marriage. The redefinition downgrades marriage to a personal relationship not bound by the obligation to society community and family which has stood the test of time and is an increasingly popular  Finally it is being said across the House then this is an issue about our views around  tackling discrimination towards homosexuals. I do not stand any truck for bigotry but I believe those very Commons tonight on the floor of the House emphasis my concern about the freedoms under threat from the spill. I have myself been subject to abuse and even death threats for my position on the redefinition of marriage. I say to my honourable friend I am on a different side of the argument to him that I have known him for many years as a friend and a political colleague and I am outraged at the frenzy has received an does people responsible for those threats should hang their heads in shame. I do not take any monopoly on victimhood. The homosexual community has been subject to abuse and that has been characterised the whole debate so. As soon as any honourable friend -- and on a friend put their head above the parapet they are called a time not see and do bigots. I have been told to be ashamed of myself, to die, specific death threats poll say I am a disgrace and I have no right to express my opinion the subject. My children have been told their dad is a bigot and a, a third and this is just the tip of the iceberg of the rude and offensive comments that many honourable members have received on Twitter. I have broad shoulders and I can stand up and support marriage and this debate today has not been characterised by hate and vitriol. We have showed ourselves in good light. I fear for the liberty of the conscience of my constituents who do not have such broad shoulders. Those public sector workers, teachers, other people in the workplace who see no protection in this Bill. Finally, I am sad to go, I have said I am angry but I am sad that my government has hastily introduced the legislation to redefine  I am resolved and pleased to join honourable members proudly standing up for marriage, proudly standing up for the equal value of people whatever their sexuality knowing that marriage is for a man and a woman.

For thousands of years, in virtually all cultures, marriage has been a defined to be a long life union between a man and a woman.

When the Minister came to the dispatch box to introduce the Bill, she was asked about the rights of teachers who introduced -- he failed to introduce this in the classroom? Could they be dismissed?

I preface my comments by saying I have a lot of respect for the right honourable gentleman for Tottenham, but I was personally offended at the comments he made which exemplified the tone of the debate  with an inference that opposition to this Bill is akin to being a white supremacist in  It is nonsense. Frankly, Rosa Parks is a secular saint, she did not give up her seat for me to go to the back of the bus as a traditional Christian conservative who believes in marriage.

For me, the points that have been raised have reflected the many personal battles I have faced in my life. Many have spoken and written about deeply held religious beliefs. From an early age I developed those beliefs, going to church without the support of my family. This faith was something that grew over time, but in my adolescence, I began to realise I was gay. Being gay in a small Welsh village was like being the only day in the village. LAUGHTER -- only gay in the village. When this was announced, it reignited the dilemma as I have  I hold dear the principle of religious freedom. Many of the letters I received have raised those points.

Equality measures introduced in the past have changed attitudes and I have been witness  This is another step  Marriage is a wonderful  but for too long we've seen that decline in many people making that commitment. Rather than seeing this as a threat to that  surely we should see it as a great opportunity. To show how much better our society is when people commit to one another.

In  most divorces are due to unreasonable behaviour. It is quite obvious that if a gay partner went off with somebody else or there was no sexual relationship, this could be construed as unreasonle  so in practice there's a homosexual version of adultery and consummation. Indeed I would have thought the draftsmen or women would be able to work that out, so it is a red herring. The issue of children has been raised. This is not about adoption but it is clearly the case that the increasing stability of our gay couple in terms of providing a loving and stable relationship for children is improved by this, not  Surely it is better to have a stable couple than an instable individual or a child in a  In terms of equal rights to marriage in your own Church, there is an issue here of course, that the freedom of religion, the question we're asking is whose freedom is it?

There's a Bill before the other House to pardon Alan Turing. We probably wouldn't be here debating in freedom today without his genius at Bletchley Park.

I hope that that is successful in the other place. If anybody feels,  that this is some historical footnote they should think again.

I think this measure is long overdue. As we look at what's happening in the other place, what I would ask honourable members to remember perhaps is that when Alan Turing took his own life, it is thought he actually laced an apple with some cyanide. An apple being the symbol of forbidden love. I would say that homosexuality is not forbidden love. It is time this House recognised that and actually recognised that you cannot be a little bit equal. This matters. We've heard honourable members and colleagues telling us that it matters to them.

So this Parliament can tweak all it  with laws and legislation, but it cannot pretend that marriage of same sex couples is even close to being on a par with mixed-sex  because of nature itself. It is a fraud for the frontbench. It's a deceit, Mr Speaker, for this House to pretend that it has embarked on something for the most pathetic of reasons. For public relations reasons.

The nonsense in this House and this Bill makes marriages. They map over  admittedly, they extend rights and privileges to married couples and indeed they extend status to married couples. But Government does not change nature. Marriage would exist without  and did exist without Governments, so ultimately the twink with this Bill to redefine marriage is a nonsense, but Governments can damage marriage, and they can therefore damage society by its very intervention.

In fact for the frontbench of this House to pretend today that it is about a concept of love is wrong. And to homosexuals and to gay people, the fact of the matter is this Bill does not create love for them. They create love for themselves. So it is nonsense to pretend that we are involved in legislating for love.  Of course I will give  I'm grateful. I don't think homosexuals are looking for the law to provide love for any of us.

I wish that were something that happened a lot more  The really big issue and won the debate very rarely in this  which is an unfolding tragedy across the nation, is the collapse of family life, and I have to take issue with their shadow Secretary of State who said that family life has not fallen apart.

We do not discuss that enough in  or what we can do to  I just hope that this is not the last time that hundreds of members of parliament come together to discuss these really important issues of family life. I think that is there really huge issue which we must not miss as a  In his speech, his landmark speech that the Prime Minister made in December, 2011, he  the United Kingdom was a Christian country. Those were his  I was very pleased to hear him say that. I think what we're doing this afternoon should give us pause for thought because we will be realigning the laws of this country in a very different way from what Christian doctrine  and I think we should take note of what the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury said  what did Roman Catholic church just sing, and many others  Let me quote just two verses from the New Testament, when Jesus was talking about marriage, he said at the beginning, the creator made them male and female for this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and the United to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. That was his definition of marriage. I absolutely recognise the fact that homosexual people want to celebrate their relationship, which is what civil partnerships are. All the rights and privileges of marriage are vested in civil partnerships. If it is the case that civil partnerships are not sufficient, then create a new term, Colleter Civil Union, call it a lifelong  they now have the ability for church to bless a full partnerships in church, if they are willing to do so. We have the opportunity to provide the celebration they are looking for without changing a foundation institution of the country.

Some have said they find it disgusting that polygamy was mentioned here. For the record I have never ahead that comparison.

The Government recognised in 2007 there were over 000 bigamous or polygamous marriages in England and Wales. This was identified by members in the House of Lords. The unintended consequences of this Bill will allow the introduction of a polygamous marriage, as advocated last night on television by Peter  Therefore I will be votes against the Bill on behalf of the 000 constituents who've made their their opposition to me. I am angry that I have defended people who are homosexual. Many in this chamber who've then left, and they deride me as a bigot, sending me text messages saying that because I don't support them I am wrong. We do not have the right to redefine marriage over the heads of our constituents. The primary commandment is to love the Lord my God with all my heart, soul, mind  I've been reminded by one of my ordained constituents that that should be used as a way of defining the second great commandment, try to treat my neighbour as myself. Essentially what we are doing is saying can we remove the barriers to stop same sex couple to enjoy the at onement of marriage? It is not redefining  Just taking away barriers. I was taught by three people who was homosexual. I only knew one was homosexual at the time. He got married at 60 to a would. One was murdered by a rent boy. Harry Williams explains the difficulty of coming to terms with his homosexuality. He shouldn't have had to do that. He should have had the chance of a happy life. People have said there's a huge psychological effect on a child being brought up by two people of the same sex. That's not the experience I've got of those I know.

And the theology I want to come back to in a second. The Danish cal was quoted but apparently in Denmark the Parliament passed that rule. They didn't put the lock the Secretary of State has put on this in terms of its protection. I would equate it with what happened in the previous century in terms of  It is interesting all this talk about undying marriage and marriage always being the same and the continuation and the popularity of marriage. Nobody seems to have mentioned the loosening of the divorce laws. As a Roman Catholic, where divorce is treated different. But nobody to my knowledge has ever challenged the right of a Roman Catholic priest or indeed an Anglican to refuse to marry a divorced couple. It has never actually happened.

Some people say this bill is about  but they matter. Words express the values of our society. This Bill about marriage is part of the astonishing and wonderful change that's taken place over the last 50 years. That has taken millions of us from criminalisation to legal equality, and the enjoyment of self worth and  That certainly weren't apparent to me as a young man. What I understood was that there was something wrong with me that had to  And for three decades I managed that struggle. And the relief and happiness that comes from not having to do so any longer is due to the courage of others who fought for all of the measures advancing equality over the last five decades that have the precursors of the Bill. What I'm about to say needs to be understood against the enthusiasm and appreciation that I have for those prepared to lead on this issue, particularly the Prime Minister. And the final line of the Stonewall briefing for today's debate says, Stonewall therefore urges tow support this modest, final elective measure of equality for homosexual men and women in England and Wales. But Mr Speaker, as presented, the Bill isn't the final measure. While civil partnerships remain only open to same sex couples we will have retained an inequality which we will have to revisit. However much I have tried to explain to my constituents that we propose to legislate to deliver equality in the eyes of the state, and protecting the beliefs of the  I do not believe my constituents of faith understand this differentiation between marriage in the eyes of the state or marriages in the eyes of their  I am a Catholic and religious freedoms are very important to me, as is my religion, but so too is equality and tolerance. I think this Bill protects both of those things that are important to me. I came here to abstain. I've listened to this debate in a way I've listened to no other. It is my intention not to abstain but to support this Bill tonight. I am delighted to hear that intervention from my honourable friend. The course to support this Bill and to make those distinctions clearer as the Bill has its passage through  Much of this Bill would be another step forward, even if unamended this, Bill gives us vehicle to properly differentiate marriage in the eyes of the state and religious marriage. Simply put, we should be legislating for equal civil marriage and enabling religious organisations to carry out same sex marriage if they wish to and protecting them if they I am sure he is aware of the book,  where some animals are  but some are equal than  isn't it the case that men should be allowed to marry men, and women to marry women, in a civil  not a religious man aged?

This Bill, as presented now, starts down this  and I welcome it. I urge the  do the job properly on this, and do not leave unfinished  Like my honourable  this is an issue on which I have thought long and hard. I am a key proponent and greatly value the Institute of marriage. Like many honourable members, I have received a large number of letters and e-mails on the subject. At the  when I first started receiving them, I undertook research on the subject, looking at issues raised. In July they published a paper setting out by a  At the time I concluded there was no compelling case that had been made against the change. I wish to stand by that paper, and moved towards a society at ease with itself. Since the Bill was  e-mails have continued  and I respect the deeply-held view that I have heard. This is all a matter of conscience, and we must all respond with the integrity that the debate shows. The outcome of the ballot box cannot be allowed to drive the important debate. I resent the implication is that suggests it  In my paper I pointed out Spain was a good example. It Holyrood gay civil marriage in 2005, and there have been no changes  Life has gone on as normal. It is not surprising to see why. Less than 2% of marriages have been same-sex marriages. Through discussion I have come to realise there's a lack of depth and clarity in some of those responses, and although support for the bill will go through scrutiny, I am concerned that some issues will be too fundamental to be resolved by this  so I asked the minister how open he is likely to be during the committee to undertake fundamental reform, including reviewing civil partnerships. As I thought about the issues, I have been troubled. Deep down I remain of the view that to make it legal has the right thing to do. I cannot comprehend that the marriage would undermine a heterosexual marriage, but I have come to question whether this legislation has been prepared  which was back to the issue I raised in relation to the  I am sure that much of the public disquiet is due to the speed with which this has come  It was not in the main  it was not in the Coalition Agreement and not in the Queen's Speech. Wells none of this is essential to bring forward legislation, it brings a deeper emotions and we need to reflect the genuine concerns raised by so many  We need to allow for discussion and understanding, whereas there has only been time for argument and counter-argument. Given my thought on the issue, I cannot fault against it. But I do ask the Minister for reassurance that when it comes to the committee stage of this, that the committee will be fundamental in looking at the issues involved and will begin some of the education process that has been missing over the past few months as one-sided has nearly stood there and chided at the other.  Many people have spoken powerfully on the debate, and I have nothing to add to the feeling. What I would like to discuss is the reason that they marriage Act came  which was to protect those people who dissented from the common view at the time. Before 1936 you had to get married in a Church of England church, and there are many people that -- there were many people who that did not apply  The then government brought in  A Roman Catholic lady was married to another Roman Catholic, but the husband ran off and left her destitute because they did not have a binding legal marriage. This was a very forward-looking piece of  and the arguments that were against it at the time were not dissimilar to those we are hearing today, that marriage was exclusively the preserve of  and that by extending it in any way whatsoever devalued it. And although the number of people who were married at the time who were atheists was miniscule, it has now risen to 60%, and we do not see them as being of any less worth than those conducted within the  And so, I just wonder whether in this chamber, over 100 years later, we should seek to protect the liberties of another minority and one that has been a press and forgotten for so long. --  In some ways they us is the most difficult issue I have faced in two and a half years as an The majority of my constituents support this, but some do not. I find myself on an -- a different side of the argument than some of my colleagues. I have faith groups in my constituency that want to conduct these marriages. We have heard a lot about religious freedom. It would be totally wrong for any church or mosque to be forced to carry out a marriage that they did not want to, but it is equally wrong that there are churches who want to carry these out but they are being prevented from doing so. We have people who want to get married and we say that we are not sure if we want to allow them to do  Are there any reasons for opposing this change? Can we guarantee that there won't be a successful challenge? At the moment, there is no guarantee that the current law cannot be challenged. We have got the most eminent lawyers in the country telling us the risk is inconceivable, and the Church of England says we do not believe this is realistic or likely. The other point that has been put to us is it is going to undermine  If I thought I was going to go home tonight and be accused that I was undermining my marriage  I would not vote for it. It is controversial, it was controversial when be equalised the law of consent, it was confidential when the last Labour government rightly legislator for civil partnerships, but once they were done and the world did not end, public opinion changed, which is what will happen when this is  I do not like change, there is a part of me that would like to change -- take the world back to  but I did not have the pressure of a demanding job, but there is another part of me who recognises the failure of this  The Conservatives -- for Conservatives to work, we have to accept that the world changes, and we have to shape the change and preserve the best of what we  which is what this Bill  If it becomes law, it will not undermine marriage or lead to church has been forced to conduct same-sex marriages, but it will allow people of the same-sex to exchange vows and be part of the same institution.

In 1997, I was watching television after the result of new Labour's landslide,... More recently, we were humiliated. How did we go from such success to .. Some people were tired of  some people hated us, and there were issues like sleaze, but my observation was that despite the many great things we have done in  society have moved on, and we have not. 13 years later, the Prime Minister on the steps of Number Ten recognised and generously acknowledged in Labour's time the country has become a more open country, and it was right he recognised that. Since 1997, we have rethought issues we face. The rhetoric of race, single parenthood,  a commitment to higher education for all people, embracing  leadership on international development, and a monumental confidence that we have shown to supporting the lesbian and gay community. All testify to a modern Conservative Party, now reflecting the values of modern  in ways we could not have contemplated in 1997, it alone sympathised with. I say this not because I am pursuing votes and constructing this argument about pursuing vaults, but because I want to see my party reflect the values of my country. Give way. If the majority of the Conservative Party go through the "no" vote tonight,  despite show that what we have got is a Veneer, rather than real change? I do not agree  and it demonstrates that a modern Conservative Prime Minister has put forward a really progressive idea which we can  Today we are on another road to equality, an idea promoted by a Conservative Prime Minister, fiercely debated by my party, with significant challenge from within. I have been contacted by about 120  and the majority have asked me to oppose this Bill. But from  can I thank people who have given the considered and thoughtful views. I have laid out  but what is important, the one issue that has come up over and over again, is that people of religious base do not want churches to be forced to marriage people of the same sex. We have put those provisions and safeguards in place, and I'd want to demonstrate to the people in my constituency that we have addressed those fears. We have debated this at great length, but the vast majority of people out there in the real-world do support the principles behind the bill. All the evidence has suggested that, the vast majority of people High Speed Two supported, and I have got to say that the vast majority of those of religious faith, but I believe it is right that we promote marriage to all. It is admirable and it is the right thing to do. Thank you Mr Speaker it's a privilege to participate in this  I know there's been a high quality of speeches and people who are passionate on both sides of the argument on this. Generally it has been good measured. I am going to vote against the Bill. Marriage is about loving commitment to one another but to me it is about  the bedroom rock of society. I do -- the bed rom of society. I do think the -- the bedrock of society. This is rushed legislation which hasn't been consulted on. The consultation that did happen I believe was inadequate. I am concerned that you can have as many legal opinions as you like, but the Government isn't planning to indemnify any institution against legal losts if they are challenged. They are continuing to keep the idea of civil partnerships solely for people of the same sex, perpetuating an institution, effectively two tiers which it will deny to people of opposite sexes. There are too many inconsistencies. The way the Church of England law is intertwined with the law of England is very difficult to unpick. There is no doubt about that. I think what's been fair to say is that honourable members recognise that people who are opposing this Bill today are not doing it because they are homophobes. Not solely doing it because of their religion. In fact more Catholic MPs who are Conservative are voting for the Bill today than against. But it is fair to say there is concerns about the way this law is being  Not enough has been listened to about the valid concerns of people who are frightened about will they now be prosecuted because they will have to offer all kinds of weddings? The Secretary of State did not say but the legal advice suggests that people who work for councils will not be able to discriminate between  I understand the reasons why that might be, but it is not Val today say that people will not be affected because of the changes in  I'm not trying to that the love between people of people of the same sex is evil. Henry VIII criminal sized homosexuality. It was repealed by Queen marry, a Catholic monarch, and reinstated by  I would like to think it has been the Church of England principal in some of the horrific abuse on aspects like that. One of the things I wanted to say is I appreciate this will probably go through at second reading. It is important the Government listens to voices in committee and people who are not selected in committee can still attend and make their views heard and amendments accordingly. I thank honourable members for their  Mr Speaker, this debate goes to the heart of our 21 century  In Parliament we rightly advocate for equality and freedom and the protection of minority  But too often the rights of one group directly conflict with the rights of another. This isn't  Back in the 1850s a political hero of mine, John Stuart Mill tried in his essay on liberty tried to define where one person's liberty ends and another begins. He said we should be without impediment from our fellow  so long as what we do doesn't harm them. The issue of same sex marriage I believe tests human liberties to the limit. As a Christian I've been strug with trying to square off that the Bible teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman. Yet I believe God loves us all equally. Whether we believe in him, whether we go to  and whatever our sexuality. The first point I want to make is I wholeheartedly believe that same sex couples have as valid a relationship with their partner as do homosexuals. I also believe in the eyes of state we all deserve to be treated equally. I want to go back to the question of how one person's liberty shouldn't be allowed to encroach on another's. I am genuinely torn. I have deep sympathy with the hundreds of my constituents who fear that the legislation for same sex marriage while not intended will profoundly encroach on their right to live according to their faith. For many the conviction that marriage can only take place between a man and a woman means they feel their own marriage is undermined by what they see as a profound change to the biblical definition. For others, they fear that same sex marriage will lead to those working as  as preests, as chaplains and in the caring professions will be unable to express their own profoundly held views in the  I share their concerns. I feel they are right too fear discrimination against their own faith if this legislation is  Finally, I don't believe we have any mandate for this Bill. There is no nationwide clamour for same sex marriage. Civil partnership does provide state recognition for the love of same sex partners. And if we were truly seeking equality, surely we would also be legislating for homosexual to enter into civil partnership. This Bill causes great hurt and for many represents a radical reform without proper consideration of the consequences. I deeply regret the way hate diminished the principles of democracy and liberty in this  It is being rushed through to the shock of many people. Fundamental change like this should give time and space for consideration. But, Mr Speaker, this isn't a sixth form debate this is legislation from one of the oldest Parliaments in the world, so the message we give from this place matters deeply. So with great sadness I shall be positively  I will be walking through the aye lobby in solidarity of the same sex couples whose marriage is an eggs pressing each their love for one another. And I shall also be walking through the  I'm grateful for catching your eye. Though it has caused the Prime Minister a spot of  I think he was absolutely right to bring forward and raise the principle enshrined in this  One only needs to look at the number of European countries that are adopting same sex marriage and the statement of President Obama of the United States to understand this was an issue that had to be addressed and not judged. And the Bill itself contains within it a noble ambition. It is an ambition that I share, but I shall not be joining my colleagues in the aye lobby this evening The House of sparly expressed opinions on both sides perhaps I can take a moment to explain my position. As many  the issue for gay people in this country has changed dramatically over many years and over my lifetime it has gone from a situation where homosexuality was not recognised in the public square, through a childhood where the absence of understanding of that issue was loud as any absence can  Through a recognition that when one came of age that the very act of having sex could lead to the catching of a contagious illness, and a recognition that that illness in turn could lead to loved ones and friends dialling. And political opponents using one's sexual orientation as a political weapon to seek to achieve the accumulation  notwithstanding what their party might say. But out of that period and perhaps significantly from the period of the reaction to HIV and AIDS came the strength and the power for the recognition of same sex people and same sex couples to have unions. This country should be enormously proud and the last Government should be enormously proud, and the Member for Rutland and Melton proud in his role in bringing civil partnerships into legislation. I am enormously proud of what that means when I can talk to a one man who shortly will be in this place to see how he can marry his partner. But what all of that has told me Mr Speaker is though it is important for me to speak in this debate, it is as important that I should  When one receives so many observations from one's  of deeply-held views, I think it is important for all members of this House to have some humility before they express their own vote on their own opinions. I would also say, as many of those expresss have come from a religious  one should understand this. Faith matters. And we ignore the subtlety of the sinews of faith that operate in our public square if we seek to push to one side the real concerns and objections that people may have. We may ultimately decide this is a Bill we should  I certainly hope we can do. This I would hope the Secretary of State will recognise there are concerns with the anomalies in this  Real concerns about the ramifications of this Bill.

That may not be possible in this instance, but if we want to achieve that long- standing and apartment change to the meaning of marriage, I would ask my right honourable friend to consider with whether that indeed will be necessary. I was very pleased and proud early on during the initial discussion on this debate when the consultation document was launched to state very publicly that I believed that marriage is between a man and a  And I stand by that commitment.

The reality is that the vast majority of my constituents share my view that there is no need for such a  If I thought in any shape or form that same sex couples did not have the same rights before the  I would think again. But the reality is that civil partnerships introduced by this Parliament, well before I was elected. Introduced those rights for same sex couples. But there are differences between the relationships between same sex couples and homosexual couples. A couple have been mentioned. For  a same sex couple cannot consummate a marriage. It is a physical impossibility. They cannot produce children without a third  Either a sperm donor or a sur gait is required. So those two things tart to change the fact of equality and equal treatment. We then have a position as a party where we have no mandate to intrusion any change to the law, because we didn't promise to do so, and when we introduced the consultation document, what was chosen to do was not should we do it but how to do it. As a result the coalition for marriages petition was completely ignored in this whole process. I think the clear issue is on legal opinions that we've heard about challenges. We should also remember Parliament  Ministers propose laws to Parliament. But it's the courts and lawyers that interpret the laws that are passed.

Will our teachers be forced, because disciplinary codes are the requirement of head teachers and governing bodies. Will teachers be forced against their devout religious views to teach things that they fundamentally disagree with?

It is all very well to say the law will uphold and protect them, but the reality is we've already had one person who lost his job.

I paint a picture of a teacher in a school who does not agree with this. What will you say to the headmaster raw headmistress? They do not want to give this lesson.

I think that is a sad day for  and a sad day for the  A welcome the opportunity and privilege to take part in this  I often recall the day a few years ago, when I finally plucked up the courage to tell my parents but I am gay. I began a conversation with, you know I am never going to be able to marry.  I used that form of words as a way of broaching in Lockwood -- an awkward conversation, and I did not think much of it at the time. But how often reflect on it, and it makes me very sad that that was a factually correct statement for so  I look at the marriage my parents have, fortified years and going strong, and I aspire to the  -- 45 years.

And I do not understand why some people feel threatened that allowing me to have that in any way diminishes what a heterosexual couple have. I want the same things. My honourable friend was absolutely right when he said we do not talk enough about helping relationships, strengthening them, rewarding people doing the right thing. We  But stopping gay people marrying is not part of that. It is not going to diminish it. I very much welcome the bill today. There are very different interpretations of marriage. We have heard them discussed today. Some people do not wish divorcees to remarry, others are comfortable with it. I have no -- I am no theological expert, but the concept of marriage has evolved  and I think it is possible to respect those who do take a traditional view of marriage. I do not agree with it, but I respect those who hold that view. It is surely possible to both respect that and allow others to enjoy the benefits of marriage. Other countries have managed it  Spain, Canada, many other  It is surely not beyond our wit and wisdom to devise that in LOL in this country. That is why I very much welcome the Bill today, and will go through it with pride. This is one of the finest the days I have had the privilege to listen to. This journey can be traced back many  whether it is 100 years ago with the suffragettes, 1922, when women were entitled to be MPs, 50 years ago when we had the civil rights movement, and we had homosexuality being made legal, or 10 years ago when we had civil partnerships made legal. This house is on a journey, and this country is on a journey, too. We are all  and this House must Ulting this piece of legislation tonight -- this House must change  and that is why I am supporting  This is a large step for all of us to be taking, and there are significant impact on all of us, but it is also right that we should support those who wish to go on this particular journey. This is not a bill that is perfect. Anyone who has listened to the debate will know that even the most ardent supporters of this debate accept that this bill requires improvement, so I strongly urge the House that this bill has proper committee consideration as it goes forward.  this is a matter of  I spent 20 years as a community activist, councillor, lawyer and MP, seeing examples of difficulties occurring when couples fail to commit, failed to bring up children in the right way, and yet when two people show a desire to commit been the most serious way  are we to deny them this because they are of the same sex?

What I  Mr Speaker, is that every single one of those contributions will have been listened to with immense care and attention by  gay and transgender people around the country, for whom of course this debate is of profund  I am really delighted that we have had this debate today. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward this legislation at this time. Because this is a rare thing in this place, I think,  a chance for us to  A chance to have a debate about a happy subject. I think we should enter into it in that spirit this evening. Labour introduced civil partnerships and legislation in 2004. Since then in  very short period, if we think about it, they've become widely and readily accepted. And quickly it has become time to finish what was started then. I'm very pleased that we are making progress with the Bill today. Now, it is quite clear, Mr Speaker, that there are concerns relating to detailed aspects of the Bill which of course is right that we should examine carefully in committee. But I want to say to those who say there are more important things that we should be doing now in this Parliament, that I cannot understand why we would not think it important to take time to  encourage and enable more people to enter into marriage as an expression of their stable, loving and committed relationship. I will just pick up on one or two of the arguments Mr Speaker. The argument that marriage can only exist between a man and a woman. I recognise that that is the teaching in many faiths, but as honourable members have pointed out, marriage isn't just a religious matter. It's a social institution too. And precisely because it is a social institution, the meaning of marriage changes over time. As society's values have changed. Those changes have prove than marriage is remarkably resilient. Indeed its resilience derives in part from its ability to adapt to changing social mores. And by recognising and extending the definition of marriage to reflect today's greater openness towards and recognition of same sex relationship, the legislation does not weaken the institution of  On the contrary, it takes  It strengthens it. It helps to perpetuate it. Those who argue that marriage can only exist between persons of the opposite sex have also pointed to the procreation of children as a defining element of marriage. But that is to see marriage very  The possibility of marriage has always existed for couples for whom children would not be an option. I'm glad to say as a 52-year-old woman we've never forbidden over twhild-bearing age from entering into marriage -- child-bearing age from entering into marriage. There's plenty of evidence to show that what children need above all to thrive is to live with families where there is stability and love. I can understand the concerns about  but stigma is something we as a society can and have a responsibility to do something  And as to discussion about the need for female and male role models for children, there are of course already very many successful families who do not conform to the traditional two-parent nuclear  and their children do  Wider family networks, school and community supply a range of role model it is, as they will for children brought up in same sex  We should all take a role in ensuring that.  very importantly, for the young person who is trying to make since of his or her own  the public affirmation and celebration of same sex marriage can offer a promise of acceptance and assurance. So, Mr  there are aspects of this legislation that will be considered very carefully in sce. But the underlying -- in committee, but the underlying purpose is one that we should celebrate. It is good. The public support it. Three in five people of faith support it. And, most tellingly, there's a changing  the generation under 50 by far support it. We should be proud in this Parliament to afford the right to marry to same sex couples.  we lay down a marker for equality. And our society as a whole will be stronger for it. THE SPEAKER: I call the Minister,.  thank you. I think by our calculations we've had over 70 speech this is afternoon. This has been a lively and impassed debate. If I might say so, one I think that shown this House at it best. It has demonstrated how deeply members on all sides of the House feel about  I hope very much that we can continue to respect those differences as the Bill moves towards committee and report. This is a Bill with a very straightforward proposition at its heart: Whether extending marriage for same sex couples strengthens marriage and increases equality, or whether it is a threat to religion and society. The Government believes that it is the former, and as the honourable Member for Battersea said, and I believe this is a Bill whose time has come. With the limited time available to me, I will try and deal briefly with the main issues raised during the  the honourable Member for Banbury asked whether the Government would look again at  We are happy to discuss this part of the Bill again with the Church of England. And doubtless it will come up again at  The Member for Henley asked whether we would look at things with an open mind in committee and report. We will, but of course they have to be within the scope of the Bill. The Member for Exeter asked about the position of the Church of England. In their  the Church of England have said it is essential that the various locks in the Bill are preserved as drafted. There was a point raised by the honourable Member for Chesham and Amersham. The Member for Exeter asked about the position of a clergyman asked to marry a same sex couple in another building. A Church of England clergyman could not marry a same sex couple according to Church of England rights, because he would need the approval of the governing authority of his Church. He or she would also need to be licensed and the pre-emts premises would need to be licenced. It is unlikely all three criteria would be fulfilled. The I'm sorry I forget this one, but one of the honourable members from Northern Ireland asked about marriage courses run by the churches and whether they would be affected by the Bill. The answer is  There are existing protections in the Equality Act 2010 which ensures that non-commercial religious organisations can restrict their services on the bases of sexual orientation. A number of members asked about the legal position in Denmark. When they introduced same sex marriage in Denmark their legislation required their established Church to conduct such ceremonies that. Makes it fundamentally different to the position in this country. That's not the approach we are taking with this legislation. And finally we were asked about  The case in Brazil that the honourable member cited was of a legal marriage of three people in a civil union. It is not one that applies here.  in conclusion, as I said at the beginning, this has been a good and lively debate during which all sides have had an opportunity to place their arguments on if record. We will  as the member is iting opposite said, to examine the Bill in detail in committee, starting with detailed evidence sessions  He said this has been a lively and passionate debate. Will the Government consider taking the committee stage on the floor of the  so that some of us who've not been able to speak today and others could really have a chance to question the Minister in detail on this Bill? Mr Speaker, I entirely understand the point that the honourable gentleman is making. There's a procedural issue here, which is that many of the churches and people who wish to come and give detailed evidence during the evidence session have asked us not  that because if we were to take the committee stage on the floor of the House we would have to forgo the ability to question them in the evidence session is. It is to protect the ability of the religious groups who wish to give evidence in person that we've been unable to do that.  at the heart of this Bill is a straightforward  If a couple love each  the state should not stop them getting married unless there's a good reason. And in this day and  being gay is not a good reason, if it ever was. I know for some religions and faiths this goes beyond their beliefs. I respect that entirely, and as a result the Bill specifically protects the rights of those who do not agree and does not compel anyone to do  All religious organisations are free to choose whether to opt in or to opt out. This Bill simply allows people to get married who are currently excluded from doing so purely because they are of the same sex. It's a clear and simple objective, delivered in a way that promotes and protects religious free. In  Mr Speaker, I believe that it is a sensible and timely step  and on that basis I commend this Bill to the House.
