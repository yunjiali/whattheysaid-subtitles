Will come to live coverage from the House of Commons. In just over one hour's time MPs will discuss the details of the Government's bill  Later today, MPs have moved on to opposed council matters with a general debate on the City of London and the Humber Bridge Bill. Join me for a round-up of the day  First it is questions to their help Minister and his team. The private Bill set down for a consideration this day. Consideration of what day? Tuesday,  The questions to the Secretary of State for Health. Question number one. Comparison performance data is essential to raise standards in the NHS. I have commissioned a review to consider whether these should be used in health and social care. My right honourable friend would be aware that NHS north-west London has made considerable use of comparative performance data to justify closing four accident and emergency services in the area. They are closest to my constituents who will be wondering what that will do to raise standards of health care provision locally. Would my right honourable friend appreciate there is strong support among its my constituents for any calls to review this situation and the use of comparative performance data? I would like to congratulate my honourable friend for the hard come -- campaigning she has done for her  I do think there is a very important role for comparison performance data, particularly when it comes to things like excess mortality and people using accident and emergency in at weekends. The situation is likely to be reviewed by Ealing Council's. I find the Secretary of State for that answer. Comparative data is essential in compiling an evidence-based. Can I draw the Secretary of State's attention to the radiotherapy debtor his department published. Will he use it for a basis in advance to radiotherapy sessions, particularly in areas like mine that lack the equipment. I know the honourable gentleman does ask a lot of questions about radiotherapy. We used a stricter evidence-based before it making any investment. Our priority is to save as many lives as possible from cancer. We are in the lower half of the European league tables when it comes to survival cancer rates. Has the Secretary of State seen at the publication information overload, tackling bureaucracy in the NHS which points to a great deal of duplication of information?There is far too much bureaucracy in the NHS which is why I have asked the chief executive of the NHS Confederation to report to me on how we can reduce the bureaucratic burden on hospitals by a third. If there is a lesson we can learn, it is we need to free up the time of people on the front line to care.  the honourable lady Astor a key questions. Under Sec -- Well as Secretary of State see reason and to ensure a level playing field for the NHS? Who exactly are or the people he hates under section 75 regulations? The  those regulations are completely consistent with the procurement guidelines that his government sent out to PCTs. He needs to stop trying to pretend we're doing something different to his Government when in fact we are doing exactly the same.We have continued to work with all our partners to ensure there is a swift and effective transition of public health to where it should be, but with local authorities. We have made �15 million available to ensure that transition is  I thank the Minister for that answer. I invited a charity to my constituency on Friday where they offer a free diabetes tests to all residents. Will local and priorities be encouraged to work with charities such as these to improve public health? The Silver Star a bus is going to be taking a many journeys, not only going to my honourable friend's constituency, it is coming to mind as well. It is an outstanding charity, and I pay tribute to the Member for Leicester East because I know it goes too often hard to reach communities, like the Asian community, where we need to make sure we do good work in reducing our levels of diabetes. I look forward to local authorities working without standing charities like Silver Star.Why is the Public Health budget so different in different boroughs? The deprivation is left in Westminster and Chelsea, and life expectancy is longer in these wealthy Tory boroughs. I do not accept that for one moment. I am proud of this Government's commitment to public health. It has insured local authorities are  in some cases, an increase in 10% in spending on public health. That is a record I am proud of and a record the oven - - the other government could not have matched. My honourable friend will be aware that local authorities and the FSA have a public health responsibility to ensure that acid entering schools and hospitals is appropriately labelled and is safe and healthy to  Does she have absolute confidence in procedures that have been followed in this regard or is she prepared to review them? I pay tribute to all the work my honourable friend has done in this  This has been a difficult time for all concerned. We need to make sure that all food absolutely is what it says on the label. And all work that needs to be done to restore confidence among its all consumers is important work, and we are very mindful of that in the Department for. Can I thank the Minister for her comments. I know the charity is looking forward to the charity is looking forward to Saturday and testing her for  I am sure we will find her in perfect health. Can I remind her it will now take, according to the health service, side years before all diabetics will have access to the sort nine cheques. Will she consider issuing guidelines to local health and well-being boards to raise awareness of diabetes? I am  like all of us, about  The recent report, we have accepted all but one of these recommendations. I pay tribute to the Silver Star and the work of  I was happy to go to the launch of a new system where people could go into boots and get the very sort of checks that there silver star is doing. There is a lot more work to be done, we recognise that and we are making a huge effort to improve the outcome of everyone affected by diabetes. I have accepted the trust's broad recommendations on this future of maternity services in south-east  The methodology used to determine the information includes King's College Hospital Foundation  I am grateful for the Health Secretary's answers. Does he recognise there are two significant  One is that any downgrade in accident and emergency services in Lewisham will put pressure on the other trusts that they are unable to cope with, and secondly that there is not yet support of all the GPs and conditions, including in Lewisham, for the current plan. Will he seek their support before anything is implemented and give assurances that we need? I recognise the concerns that he outlines. We have allocated �37 million to help the other four in these that will take some of the pressure off Lewisham's. -- other four accident and  The way this is implemented is going to be absolutely critical and we need to do it properly and extremely carefully in order to make sure we need to those concerns he talks When the Secretary of State announced his decision to downgrade Lewisham's accident and emergency services and transfer the patience to St Thomas's and kings, he said the medical director of the NHS had reviewed those proposals and, I  he believes these proposals could save up to 1000 lives every  Having now read the review, I can tell the House he makes no mention whatsoever of saving 100 lives each year. Will the Secretary of State apologise for misleading I am happy to do that. That is her suggestion and it is for the Secretary to respond as he thinks is best. Sir Bruce accepts the calculations that were made in the proposals put forward by the trust special administrator that his plans would be likely to save around 100 lives be likely to save around 100 lives reduce some of the excess mortality  That is something that he accepted and I accepted his view of that. I would just say, there are many London hospitals that have an interest and representatives thereof in this. New work is somewhat of a distance away. On  I am grateful to hear from the honourable gentleman. I am  We will hear from him on another matter. Demands for accident and emergency services at Guy's and St Thomas and Kings will go through the roof if Lewisham for A&E closes. The Secretary may state that he is keeping a small a and E, but this is nothing more than dangerous game. No blue light ambulances will call at Lewisham under his plans, even the College of emergency medicine says it does not meet their definition of an emergency  How can the Secretary of State be so confident that other hospitals in south east London are going to be able to cope once he has taken the axe to Lewisham? I recognise the fact that she has been campaigning hard, but she is massively over stating their case. The reality of these proposals is that 25% of the people that go to Lewisham a and E will no longer go  Complex cases will get better treatment as a result. Her constituents he will get better  That 25% will be spread among for other accident and emergency is and we are allocating millions to upgrade other capacities. That is as it -- sensible proposal. Local members of parliament are right to to raise concerns about the future capacity at Guy's and St Thomas and kings. The recent King's Fund showed that between October and 20th December 12, many accident and emergency departments face their worst winter in almost a  Standards of care are deteriorating with too many people waiting for too long than many being left on trolleys in corridors or waiting in ambulances outside. Does the Secretary of State accept that the NHS is struggling to cope with the toxic mix of cut and reorganisation and patients in south-east London and elsewhere are paying the price for this Government's mismanagement of the NHS?  Mr Speaker. From the government that closed or downgraded 12 accident and emergency departments in office I would expect a more mature attitude to a complex problem. Let me say, we don't take any lessons in meeting targets from that lot. The reality is that we met our targets last year in Wales, where Labour cut the NH budget of by 8%, they have not met targets since 2009. Question 4, Mr Speaker. Could I take this along with question 11 and make it clear that this is an important document we want to get right and I anticipate the document will be published next month. Can I say to the minister, will be sexual health policy document contained a strategic plan effectively resolved by government to address and reduce her HIV stigma? Especially among health care professionals, the police,  teachers and social services. A good starting-point could draw on lessons and the success of anti- stigma work by the government on mental health. I certainly support the sentiment of the honourable member question and make it clear that one thing I want to make clear is in the document is the need for everybody to eradicate it, whatever work it  prejudice, whatever it is. That is one thing I was keen to put in the document and I'm sure he would join with me in welcoming the publication next month. The and 18 pregnancy rate has fallen by 25% over the past 10  Would the Minister confirm that the strategy document will make absolutely clear that it is important to protect specialist sexual health services for young  such as the Brooks Service. An unequivocal yes, Mr Speaker. I wonder if the honourable lady would recognise the progress made in vaccination against the HPV virus to prevent cervical cancer in  I wonder if she could find the time to meet with me to discuss benefits of vaccinating boys against that virus.  It is a great member -- great pleasure to meet with my  He raises an important  I have met with a number of other colleagues to talk about their concerns about the lack of screening for young women in relation to cervical cancer under the age of 25. That is something that concerns me and there is work we look forward to doing. Happy to meet with my honourable friend. The government has been woefully complacent about reducing its sexual health strategy. The minister constantly says responsibility for decisions lies  but will she admit it is this Government's reorganisation that has created huge confusion, splitting commissioning of sexual health services between GPs, councils and the National Board. This Government's lack of interest has delayed the sexual health strategy by 21 months. Will she explain the reasons for that in May and will she commit that in the  when it comes out, it will include seriously addressing the rationing of access to contraceptives services for women aged over 25? Isn't it remarkable to have criticism of a reorganisation from someone who supported the government that did nine reorganisations in nine years. The sexual health strategy document is very important and that is why we are working hard to make sure that it is absolutely right. I undertook and rewrote a large section to make sure it delivers. It is an important document, we want to get  When it is published I'm sure she will welcome it. Any delay in the document is not preventing the right for commissioning at a  I saw that yesterday when I went to bed furred and met the Brook Organisation who have been longer engaged in a tendering process. Question 5, Mr Speaker. This is a matter for local NHS neither the Secretary of straight or ministerial team have met on the subject recently. A disappointing reply that a Minister gives. Is he aware that Whittington is a successful popular local district general hospital? Yet as part of its application to become a Foundation trust is proposing to sell off a quarter of its land to make 500 staff, including nurses, redundant and to reduce the number of beds to 177, roughly half of what it is at the moment in order to apparently provide a better service to the community which is something that is totally lost on the thousands of local people who are very angry at a reduction in the hospital services and see it as a previewed to the closure of it as a district general hospital with an accident and emergency department. Did the minister take an interest in this unprotected good local hospital from this not a sensible plan? Are thinking honourable member is right to highlight the fact that the trust has handled the issue  As he will know, decisions about local health care reside with  The point is this, if we look at the plans what the Trust is talking about is selling off land that is not used for clinical purposes and reinvesting that many in frontline patient care, investing 10 million in improving the maternity department, too 0.9 million that in that a treatment centre to support accident and emergency and 1.9 million in undergraduate education. Those assets are being sold off to directly influence and improve  that has to be a good thing. Is the Minister really aware at how angry and concerned Londoners are to the threats of their health service? It is not just the �70 million property sales in Whittington and the drop in beds, there is a threat to for accident and emergency departments in north- west London and the threat to the accident and emergency department  Ministers have accused campaigners of overstating the case. Isn't that complacent? Surely doctors and residents know the value of the services more than ministers in Whitehall. Is the Minister aware that Londoners came out in unprecedented numbers to fight for Lewisham hospital and will continue to fight for the best possible NHS services in our region? The honourable lady is right to highlight that when there are service changes, they have to be clinically let, meet the tests, engage with communities, but the  the previous government redesigned and train services. They did that very often for the benefit of patients. When services are redesigned and that is led by clinicians and that services are being delivered in a better way for  that has to be a good  Let's look at these  if they are clinically  let's see if they are improving care for patients. If  that is the right thing to do. Foetal alcohol syndrome is her lifelong condition caused by heavy alcohol consumption during  Faecal alcohol spectrum disorder is often less Sofia. There is a consensus that this is last -- more widespread. I thank the honourable lady for her  She will be aware of their medical research that suggests 7000 babies are born suffering from serious genetic and permanent  but more recently, more worryingly, is that moderate consumption has an impact on IQ. In  all drink containers have to have this written on them, according to the Surgeon-General, women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy. When is the government going to insist that drinks in Britain have the same slogan? He makes a very good point. Our advice is Clear that women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should not drink alcohol. If they feel that they must drink  then they should drink one or two units at the very most, maybe once or twice a week. Our advice is clear, but he makes a good point. The NHS figures showed that some 7 billion was spent on alcohol related illnesses. Would the Minister consider doing a campaign across the UK to combat the issue?  it is a good point. I can tell you that the other consumption of alcohol, with a pregnant or not, is something that concerns this government. That is one of the reasons why we want to introduce minimum unit pricing of  A good point well made. I am happy to meet with the honourable member to discuss further. Number seven, Mr Speaker. The National Institute for Health research supports a wide range of research including studies of pre- senile dementia including 85 study is recruiting patients with dementia and a further 17 in the set up phase.  Mr Speaker and I declare interest and this question. Dementia in the ageing population is beginning to be further understood and recognise. I appreciate the Government's efforts  but there are prone a frontal dementias, many of them, which are early onset. There is less understanding and awareness of  I welcome the Government's commitment to research on this area, but there is need to extend understanding among nurses, GPs, care providers. Will the government ensure that this wider understanding is available and extended? Can I thank the honourable lady for her interest in early onset dementia because she is right, there is a lack of understanding about dementia in general, but particularly about early onset  We are, as well as the research I spoke about earlier, we are looking at a major programme to engage GPs because there are still some GPs who think it is not worth diagnosing someone with dementia after all and there is a lack of understanding and we have to put it right. Government and charitable spending on dementia research is 12 times lower than cancer research, �590 million per year is spent on cancer  but just 50 million invested in dementia Research. What steps can we all make to increase the amount of investment in We have to catalyse private sector companies because they know the size of the potential market with people with dementia is huge. They have been frustrated in their attempts at getting a breakthrough  We have to use that research to keep them focused on this really tragic disease. No. 8,  Mr Speaker. There are unacceptable variations in the level of dementia diagnosis across  We are committed to significant improvements and have asked local areas to make improvements in diagnosis over the next two years. 43% of those suffering with dementia are currently diagnosed in North Yorkshire and Europe. That leaves 000 undiagnosed. Does my right honourable friend agree that clinical groups have a role to play and what support will they get? It is a tragedy for those 7,000 people and their families that they do not get the diagnosis, the medicine and drugs can stave off the symptoms for one in three people. We need a massive transformation and need to make it much easier to get a  We need much better understanding among East hospitals  25% of all in-patients have dementia. Question ninth. Ministers have discussed the terms of reference for reviews into  The terms of reference were published by a professors on Friday at fifth February. Over a year ago and asked the previous Secretary of State a question over gagging orders and in particular Garry Walker. In light of the recent news that our local trust has been investigated for patients F -- patient safety, can these get the orders the outlawed as soon as possible so it will not take 81 requests to ensure patient safety is paramount? All staff within the NHS should feel able to speak up and raised concerns about patient  And to insure those organisations they work for can take up those concerns and investigate them. Those people who do raised concerns about patient safety are protected under it there public exposure at. Last week I visited Salford hospital which has the lowest mortality rates in the area and the seventh lowest in the  It also has higher rates of nurses per in-patient bed. The does the Minister actually accept that good practice at hospitals like Salford Royal should be being looked at and investigated alongside the poor practice and worst mortality rates in hospitals? That is exactly what this review is  going into the 14 hospitals where there have been up concerns over the mortality data, and bringing peer review on those over leading clinicians and groups which will raise standards of practice were required. Supporting the points which had just been made by my honourable friend, may I tell the Minister there is considerable anxiety amongst my constituents the fact that the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust has a higher than average mortality rate. Can he tell us when the promised review into this situation will begin and who will be conducting it?To reassure my honourable friend, the review is being carried out and led by Sir Bruce Keogh who is the NHS medical  We're already underway in implementing the review and it should be in place by the very early summer to inform members of this House and indeed work to make improvements at a local level within trusts. People in Dudley were very concerned to discover a higher-than-average mortality rate has led to the hospital in my constituency being investigated. I have written to Sir Bruce keynote to see if he or a member of his team will meet me to discuss what has been going on. I have to say to the Minister, how does he think things at a hospital will be improved when nurse numbers in the NHS are being reduced? Waiting lists have gone up by 177%, and the NHS has had to spend thousands on the bureaucracy instead of improving frontline care. The honourable gentleman is right to raise constituents concerns. This review is to make sure any failings in local trusts are picked up and  Waiting times are down under this Government compared to the previous government. There are many more clinical staff working in  about 2000 more than under the previous government. We have 000 administrative posts and that money has been invested in patient care. If the honourable member for Crawley would like to come in on this question, he can. Never mind.This Government recognises that no hospital operates in isolation. Seven trusts are facing difficulties, and have access to be found to help with extra costs accrued due to those damaging schemes. Apologies for my  The hospital and my constituency has independent trust  The last government to build a huge PFI hospital near by which does not have that the patient volumes to sustain demand. It is loss-making. Can the Minister provide assurance there will be no forced merger? I thank my honourable friend for the question and he is right to highlight the very damaging PFI schemes. The percentage of the annual turnover going on PFI payments is 14.2%. That is unsustainable and this Government is trying to sort out the mess that was created by the last government. The Minister will be aware that support for excess PFI course was an important element in reports in the trust in south- east London. That support was widely welcomed, that recommendation was widely welcomed. However as I highlighted in questions a month ago, the Government has not accepted the financial implications of the trust's administrator for the capital costs and the transitional costs inherent in his recommendations. Will the Government agreed to meet those costs if they wish to proceed with those changes are?The honourable member is on dangerous territory talking about PFI schemes. No hospital operates in isolation. The percentage turnover that trust was paying out his 13.9%. That has caused huge difficulties in the local health care economy, it has affected patient care. The honourable member needs to recognise this government is providing �1.5 billion of support to many trusts. We have a lot of questions to get through, the answers are sometimes just too long. The Department of Health is currently working with key partners to support training in general  Of the NHS commissioning Board will be responsible for commissioning primary care, medical services and specialised services. It will have a duty to improve quality and promoting integrated  They will be responsible for commissioning most other services. The Minister is aware of the need to increase well -- health care provision in with from town. Can he assure me that the financial legacy will not hold back proposals to bring in much-needed health care provision to Witham Town itself? I applaud my honourable friend in the work she has done raising concerns of her constituents. Primary Care  we have made absolutely clear they must work closely with clinician groups to make sure they meet the financial challenges during this financial year. In the future we have real local accountability and that will be something she can feed into to insure her constituents get the health services they need. An association has written this month expressing concerns about the proposal of commissioning for highly specialist prostatic  -- prosthetics services. Can the Minister at say when he last met the association and witty agreed to meet them with me? I am grateful to the honourable member for raising that concern and I would be very happy to meet with her and the Association to discuss those concerns further. At a time when there is a lot of talk about integrated services, can my honourable friend assure the House that when commissioning primary  the board will place greater emphasis on the importance of integrating primary care into the rest of Community Health supplied by the NHS and including social care into that service? I am happy to give my right honourable friend an absolute assurance of that. The department is working closely and collaboratively with the commissioning Board and the LGA to insure we absolutely deliver integrated care which does much better at keeping patients out of hospital and maintaining their condition is much better. What is he doing for areas of high, quicker population growth to make sure we have enough GPs? The there are plans in place to increase the training places for GPs. There will 000 extra training places to meet the needs she mentions by  Question number 13.We are still far too low down the European league tables for premature mortality particularly  This is why I made it a key priority to improve our  I am grateful to my Right Honourable send for his  With regard to prevent things mortality as a result of heart disease, can he say more about what is being damn?We are investing a �34 million in cardiovascular research and there is a lot of excellent work at the Oxford biomedical Research Centre. It is widely accepted that late diagnosis in cancer makes for premature mortality. Will a government also encourage proxy members such as staging and accident and emergency admissions to be included in the indicators set to complement the one in five year survival record so we get a more complete picture and will encourage earlier diagnosis question mark no sooner do we agree 4-1 integrator to be added that he finds another of which should also  I will certainly look at that issue, but I think there is a broader question about the role of the GPs and then seeing themselves in the front line in terms of early diagnosis. People in the community at high risk, and that is a fundamental change we need to think about. Question  It is the responsibility of local commissioners to ensure resources are used effectively to meet the needs of their local  The national survey of investment in adult mental health services reports cash investment in mental health services rising between 2010-2011, but real-terms investment falling by 1%. On Friday I am meeting with Sheffield mind. One of the issues we'll be talking about is the impact on that fort of spending on crisis care. Crisis care teams are often under resourced and overstretched with four in ten trusts having staffing levels below the Department's own  Does the Secretary of State's Minister feel this is  and if not, what is he going to do about it?This Government inherited it and institutional bias against mental health in the NHS. It is true. When the team that week's target was  there was nothing available to those suffering from mental health problems. Mental health them that -- patients did not benefit from the choice elsewhere in the NHS. I agree about the importance of crisis services and the first NHS mandate has required the commissioning Board to do work on availability of mental health services and to ensure we can introduce Access standard so that mental health service users and patients benefit from the same rights as those who have physical Can I also thank the Minister for his forthcoming visit and my I say that the health care, mental health care services, which have been diminished in Europe will almost certainly be top of that agenda. I am most grateful to my honourable friend for raising VAT. I think it is my honourable friend, the  he will be visiting new  but he is absolutely right to highlight the importance of mental  The mandate makes it clear that the commissioning Board and the NHS must make measurable progress.  15, Mr Speaker. There is an estimation that the NHS could save �4.4 billion through proper investment in IT which is one reason why I set the challenge of becoming a paperless by 2018. I am grateful for the answer, but can he reassure me that investment in technology will release resources for patient care rather than follow the habit where investment is detracted from what has been available. My honourable friend makes an important point. When we encourage this investment we are thinking about unearth he reported to admit someone to trauma she had to fill out a 22 page form and then another 10 forms after that. The point is to free up time of professionals on front line. The Secretary of State will be aware that a general practice extraction service contract has been awarded to a French IT firm in the recent past. Given the concerns expressed by the Public Accounts in the National Audit Office and the way in which they have performed other contracts let by the  what has the Secretary of State got in mind to ensure that in relation to this contract there are safeguards for patient data? With respect to all IT contracts, we have learnt a great deal from mistakes made by the last Topical questions. Number one, Mr Speaker. They last month has in the government make too radical steps to fundamentally improve health  Firstly our response to the Francis report and the appalling  We announce the setting up of a chief inspectorate. This will introduce compassionate care, patient feedback from expert peer review into a system that has been long dominated by targets on box-  Secondly, we announce the long-term solution to funding social care which will not only help low-income pensioners avoid having to sell their homes, it will also make us one of the first countries where it is normal to save for social care costs as it is for a pension. This week I am meeting my constituents in Neil and Rita Denver his son made a miraculous recovery from meningitis, however many are not so fortunate. Will the Secretary of State pledge his support for meningitis UK, beat it now campaign, and including newly licensed vaccine for meningitis the hint NHS childhood immunisation programme so that no family has to live with the terror of this terrifying disease? As a father of two young children I completely share her passion for  I am happy to give my support to meningitis UK, with respect to the inclusion of a meningitis jab and immunisation  That is decided by an independent panel and I will always follow their advice.  Mr Speaker. We used to believe that tuberculosis, as a  was beaten in this country, but the number of instances are rising and there were 9000 new cases last year. Does this not  particularly when the incidences of drug-resistant TB are of a concern, that a comprehensive public health strategy is needed to tackle this and what steps are the Department taking to leap at strategy? I am grateful for the question because the honourable member has identified this is a growing  We are exploring across sector national strategy for TB while ensuring that we recognise the variance at a local level. We need to improve it. I am sure that, like me, the Secretary of State has spent recent weeks absorbing a Francis report and its recommendations. There are lessons for everyone at every level. Particularly on staffing. New analysis published later today will show that the NHS is set to lose 000 nurses other cause of this  raising doubts about its ability to respond to recommendations on staffing. Can the government say today whether it accepts those recommendations and the principle of a minimum staff to patient ratio?  if he read the Francis report Caerphilly he would have, first of all, observed that the incidence it talks about, the appalling tragedies happened between 2005 and 2009 when nursing numbers were going up. To say this is an issue about numbers is to completely miss the point. This is not an issue where there is a quick  This is an issue where their NHS became dominated for too long by a culture of targets at any cost. Unpicking that culture is the biggest challenge we have with we are going to return in a culture of past -- compassionate care. I have read both France's reports and I think it is essential everybody learnt the lessons including on this side of the house. It is also important not to repeat  The first Francis report said problems were caused because the trust cut staff to dangerously  The most worrying thing says that all in 10 of the jobs that are being lost come directly from services linked to the care of older people. Can I ask the Secretary of State, does he agree that there is a danger that the NHS is already failing to man the lessons of the recent past and will he join me in sending a message to the NHS that care of older people should be a priority for import -- for improvement not an easy target for cuts. If we are going to learn the lessons of the report and admit to  perhaps he will reflect on the fact that because we decided to protect the NHS budget, there are 8000 more clinical staff in the  He still wants to cut the budget from his current levels, something he confirmed last December. In today's Daily Express, the Prime Minister promises to prevent immigrants freeloading on our NHS. Words are one thing, can my honourable friend spell out what actions will be taken to deliver on the Prime Minister's pledge? I am happy to confirm to my honourable friend that this is an area that we intend to take profound steps in. It is the National Health Service, not an international health service. We have to ask whether it is appropriate to give free health care to short-term visitors,  people on temporary visas and that is an issue we will speak more about shortly. On 13th March and 2012, the former Secretary of State said quiet, there is absolutely nothing in this Bill that promotes the transfer of NHS abilities to the private sector, but the new competition regulations break these promises by creating requirements all commissioning to be carried out through competitive markets forcing privatisation through the backdoor. Will the Secretary of State agree to making these regulations subject to a full debate? If he had listened to my previous  the regulations are consistent with a procurement  It is not our job to be a champion for the private sector or the NHS sector. We want to be there to do the best job for  That is the purpose of these regulations. Two years ago the Prime Minister welcome to the installation of  the latest in cancer radio surgery equipment -- equipment as an example of how the NHS is progressing. Since then, the Royal Marsden has invited ministers to visit the centre, but they have not accepted the invitation. I am aware ministers have been to see other cancer research systems. Will the Secretary of State Visit and see for himself the progress that is make their? I understand that the Secretary of State has been to the Royal Marsden, but I am happy to accept the invitation. What steps has the Secretary of State taken to prevent fragmenting the National Health Service with a massive reorganisation which is costing �3 billion and diverting much-needed resources away from the front line. The truth is that this government inherited a completely fragmented  We have managed to separate health care from social care, mental health and physical health and primary care from secondary care at the very heart of the legislation that we have already passed and the proposed health and social care legislation that we hoped to introduce very soon is the principle of integrated care. I am absolutely determined that that is central to every area of the country so that we deliver proper care and avoid crisis from a glaring to keep people out of hospital. The clinical commissioning group is building on the integrated health and social care system that many have praised the area for. Can the Minister help complete integration by assisting with the -- inclusion of mental health care services within the regime? I thank my honourable friend for that question and I absolutely applaud the brilliant work being done in Torbay which has seen a reduction in hospital admissions because they care for people better. As I indicated in my last and so, it is essential that we integrate mental health as well as physical health in the system to give people proper care. On performance data, what plans does the Minister have to expand the friends and families test so it provides the reasons for patients' views and also real-time feedback on their experience of services? The friends and family test will give real-time feedback about patients' services, but it is about making sure that test is used, the data is used effectively by local trusts and also scrutinised by the Care Quality Commission so they can go in if there are problems to make sure they stand up for the rights of patients.

I beg leave to bring in a bill to provide for the regulation of letting agencies to protect tenants's deposits, to amend the law on secured tenancies, to provide for a fair rent to be applicable to all rented accommodation, to require landlords not to discriminate against people in receipt of state benefits, to require local authorities to establish a private rental sector  Parliament has a responsibility to look seriously at the issues facing people living in the private rental sector. For a long time it has been ignored. The tenants protection was removed in the 1980s by the Housing Act of  At that time, the private rental sector was quite small. In 2001 only 7% of the people in this country lived in the private rented  By 2011 this had risen to  by 2025 it will be 22% of the entire population of the UK. In inner-city areas, it is now one third of people who live in private rented accommodation. Private rented accommodation is very  When I questioned the Prime Minister on this he told me the problem was that housing benefit costs in London have now risen to £6 billion. The reason they have risen is because of the number of people placed in private rental accommodation by local authorities fulfilling their housing duties who have no control over rent levels being paid. In  the Government has now capped housing benefits at a very low level in respect of the effect of rents that are charged. The universal Is coming in later on will cause even greater problems. For those of us that represent central London constituencies, we are already witnessing a massive depopulation of our communities as private sector tenants placed there by the local authority are having their benefit limited and they cannot afford to pay the difference between the limit on the benefit and the rent being charged. I have constituents coming to me who are 100 pines and more a difference between their benefit level and their rent level. The rent levels are stupendous. Time has come, it has well arrived for us as a Parliament to look at the situation facing people at the private rented sector and introduce thereat and comprehensive regulations. That is why I have brought this Bill  To prepare for this Bill I have organised two meetings in my constituency and invited private sector tenants to come along and tell me of their experiences. Their  to put it mildly, are difficult to comprehend for the Shia nasty mess of some landlords towards tenants. I am not saying every private sector landlord is a  not every landlord goes in with the evil intent, but the lack of a regulated market, the lack of regulated agencies mean many people suffer appalling  Therefore I think we have to look at it. Letting agencies are unregulated. They charge what they like. They charge a search fee which can sometimes run into several hundred pounds, which consists of no more than checking through a computer to see if they have any properties for that person or not. It needs to be solely regulated so all of those purporting to operate in the private sector are registered and we know who they are. Deposits are often not returned and if the landlord or the agency is legally challenged on this they announce that instead of it being a deposit, it is in fact of rent in advance and they are not liable to return  And difficult questions are put concerning very minor changes that may have occurred in a flat that has been occupied by somebody's. Those that complain to the local authority of the poor standards, of the lack of repair, of the lack of  or the sheer refusal of the landlord to engage with the tenant find themselves rapidly evicted and have no real redress in law to prevent that evictions. The majority of private rental tenants are on a short contract lasting only six months. A group of tenants based at the moment in Hackney, but I suspect will spread across London, have made an excellent submission to the Department of Communities Select Committee into the private rented sector. In their proposals may include secure five-year tenancies requiring landlords to provide a balanced reason for ending a tenancy. A public register of landlords, decent homes standards to apply for all rented accommodation not just council and housing association but the housing -- private sector as well. Additionally, to have a full vetting of private landlords before they let homes including criminal record checks, tax records and previous warning letters from previous warning letters from went ahead with these proposals.

That seems to me a blatant piece of discrimination against a very large number of people and ought to be  And the crucial point to me is a return to rent regulation by a process of a fair rent through local rent tribunals. That will bring about a sense of fairness in the system not the ludicrous profit-making made by a number of small landlords in this country. In order to implement this bill, I would require the Secretary of State to consult within six months of the Bill becoming locked, on a formula for a fair rent to be  Every local authority would be required to set up a local-authority office which would monitor all law in relation to the private rental sector.

Once again,  being able to speak on a bale there is a great sense of broad agreement across the house, in particular the programme motion is allocated to provide three hours of debate at report stage before we move on to third reading and we consider this will allow plenty of time to consider any issues raised to in a narrower and tightly focused piece of legislation which enjoy his considerable cross-party  I will give way to my honourable friend. I'm always worried when the minister starts by saying the front bench and usual channels have  It is almost certainly  My specific point is, we had a programme motion, we debated the programme motion at second reading. Why is that programme motion now being overruled? Why are we now shortening scrutiny when the house and Parliament thought we would have a whole day on it? I thank my honourable friend for his intervention. I would gently point out that I didn't say this was something that the usual channels were OK with. I was pointing out that the bill in itself was one that has had positivity across the house. The content is one which follows up on private members' bills that previous members have taken forward  at second reading, was generally welcomed by a large number of members. In terms of the time for debate, we do believe it is a sufficient time for scrutiny because we have tested it at second reading and committee and, what we do know originally was we hadn't had the committee stage and that finished early. It was well  but we found the time that had been allocated were significantly more than ample. I will give way to one of the members of that fine committee. All the members were fine members, I can compare. In answer to the honourable gentleman intervention, one of the reasons we got through faster than anticipated and anticipate the same today, is because of the Government's fantastic decision to change their mind and actually put financial priority is on the face of the Bill would that power, which saved a lot of time that debate and may help us today.  The honourable gentleman makes a very good point and, of  the house is delighted that he has also received adequate recognition for his role in bringing this about. I believe he was voted politics MP of the month for his campaigning, which is a great accolade. I know he collects  having once been sexiest MP of the year in Wales, I understand. In Wales! So, he does make the important point that the government has been in listening mood on this  One of the main issues that members had expressed concerns about that a second reading stayed was around the issue of fines, that is something where the Government has listened and that was discussed further at committee. In the context of all of those things, the hours will be sufficient for debate  I hope I can provide that reassurance and on that basis I commend the motion to the house. As many as are of the opinion, say Then he there month, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for Higher opening contribution. Not much to  We agreed. Mein honourable member was absolutely right, most of the discussion at second reading are surrounded the issue of fines and the government at least under with regard to that issue. Kate, is probably more there reasonable word  Under extreme pressure not from just this side, but from other organisations and indeed some pressure from her own side of the  Had I known that the members for Christchurch and Shipley had put forward many amendments in terms of this Bill, we may have asked for more time, but given that we are relatively happy and content with what came out of the committee stage of this Bill, we will be supporting the programme motion. I am always suspicious when there is a deal done between the usual channels and that is what has happened in this case. The minister, in explaining why she thinks it is reasonable that they should be less time for debate in this report stage than was originally thought reasonable back on the 19th on  her reasoning behind that is that she does not think we needed more than three hours in which to discuss it. That is very paternalistic and, surely, she then argues that because the committee itself spend less time discussing the bill than they might have, that means we need less time at report  but surely the reason why we need to have time at report stage is because members who are not members of the Standing Committee, it is only at report stage that they have a chance to participate and move amendments. Further to that particular point, and he is  is it not the case that what turns to happen is that the government and the opposition pack the committee with people who agree with them and therefore there is bound to be no proper scrutiny at the committee stage because it is packed with supporters of the Bill? My honourable friend is absolutely  I'm not aware of anybody on the committee he felt that the bill was too strong and should be  The only people on the committee were people who either supported that they all wanted it to be strengthened. That just shows how an representative the Standing Committee on the bill was. So we now have three groups of amendments and we only have three hours within which to debate them after deducting such time as we are going to be spending on looking at this programme motion. Mr Speaker, wood and wire honourable friend agree that the problem arises because the executive decides it's time for  Within just a couple of  the government is going to bring forward proposals for a backbench business committee and when that solve the problem? Thereby hangs another subject for  Mr Speaker, because we know that in the coalition agreement there was a commitment to bringing forward the House Committee by the third year of this Parliament and we now know that that is being interpreted as meaning the end of 20th December their team. A rather an extension of the English  What it shows is that, essentially, the front bench on these issues is not to be trusted until they prove their point and we are satisfied, we are beat in -- we are to be suspicious. As a member of that Bill Committee that he criticises, it is difficult not to take offence. Clearly he must recognise that the debate he is forcing now is going to reduce the amount of time we have to scrutinise that bill and the quicker we can get to that debate, the better we will be? My honourable friend makes them on  really. If we had the original programme motion we would have been able to debate this until 7pm this evening. Because of this programme motion, which I imagine he will support, he will be supporting a curtailment of the debate. That is an outrageous slur on my honourable friend. It is clear he wants more time for the debate. The simple answer is that when the house divides, to defeat this programme motion and the previous programme motion given a whole day will be in place. I think you should apologise. I don't expect members to apologise  I think actions speak louder than words on these issues. He said that there would only be an hour to debate each three groups of amendments because of the change. I think I honourable friend was being overly generous because if there are divisions within the group, that will eat further into the time, so there may well be a maximum of 45 minutes for each group. I honourable friend is right. I am going to resume my place quite soon,  because other people want to participate in a very short  but before and did that can I make the point that the minister says that one of the justifications for curtailing the amount of time for debating this at report stage  at the committee, the committee changed the bill and introduced the ability to find fault the adjudicator on the face of the bill without having to be the subject of a regulation in the  That is a fundamental change of the bill and I would have thought that would be an argument for more discussion at report stage rather than less. Coming back to the point where he stated that actions speak louder  can he 0.2 where, during the second reading of this  either he or the member for Shipley actually raised issues of concern during that debate, which surely would have been the opportunity to Telegraph to the front bench the fact that there were issues of contention which needed more time at this stage? I don't think the front bench needed Telegraph messages because one of the precursors to dispel was a private member's bill in the last Parliament and that private member's bill was fought against, line by line, by my honourable friend and I joined in in supporting him. So the bill that we have before us today is a bill that is still a bill which I and a number of other colleagues are very concerned about. The fact that I did not speak in the second debate is not an argument to be used against me because, obviously, now is a chance to look at amendments. In a second reading debate all one would be able to do is make a general comment or flat at general  I don't think those concerns needed to be flat at the game because I raise them earlier. I don't wish to prolong the programme debates, but isn't it fair to say that at second reading, the country was not engulfed with the anxiety about the food chain that has happened subsequently and it would be a disaster if there wasn't enough time today to debate at least amendments for and 35, which are on the public's mind? The honourable gentleman makes a good point. If he looks that amendments to be considered in the  it includes two new  Those new clauses in my name have been driven by the fact that this is an issue which is more than just concerning the UK. We are talking about supply chains across the world and this Bill seems to be -- it needs further definition of how little impact of global supply  I have severe reservations about changing his programme motion and I think it is indicative that this is a government which is lacking in self-confidence. Why doesn't it have self-confidence to allow us to debate these issues for a whole day as it originally intended? Why does it wish to close down debate? Is it frightened of scrutiny? To query a couple of things that my honourable friend, the minister, a first class Minister, and had she been a shadow minister I think she would have been arguing for  I notice that she has now been left alone on the front bench which seems to indicate that nobody in government wants to be associated with his programme  I notice the deputy leader of the house who, when he sat over  was a fine proponent of opposing programme motions and it must be very sad for him that he Hastie take this lying this  I think there is an intellectual flaw in the in Minister's argument. If the Minister is saying that this isn't controversial and we have plenty of time in three hours to discuss it, why bring in another programme mention? The debate will automatically did -- automatically finish within three hours. It is this approach of this executive that it wants to be wedded to programme mentions. I know, Mr  that this is not the view of the Prime Minister. I'm sure every member in this house has Red fixing broken politics, the excellent speech by the Prime Minister in May 2009, when he roundly criticised programme  It said it reduced  He said what happens now,  it is sawn up in Downing  pushed through on his second reading, goes to a committee, the committee is stuffed with people who support it, there is no way you can get on the committee unless the whips support it and then what happens, when it comes back to consideration where backbench members who are interested in it want to make amendments to discuss it, there is not enough time to discuss it. That is exactly what will happen today, I guarantee, if this programme motion goes through. Amendments will not be reached and discussed and that is fundamentally what the government wants. It does not want scrutiny of this Bill and This occurs when both front benches are  As the shadow minister  he was happy with it and the usual channels have agreed to Every single member criticised the Bill at second reading. I hate to criticise the whip department, actually they were not doing their  When they let through the people like him instead of serious parliamentarians who want to scrutinise the Bill.

Sometimes I have succumbed and actually made noises which appeared to be contrary to the Government's view, but turned out to be the Government's of view  I just want to briefly make the very serious point of principle here. The problem we have got is because of the timing of  The timing of Parliament is controlled entirely by the  Parliament has already agreed a timetable motion, which in my opinion it does not need to do. We should be able to scrutinise bills for the time that Parliament think is necessary. It went through on second reading with a whole day to scrutinise this on consideration and third reading. That is what we should be doing today. The only  and I think the Shadow Minister let it slip out, the any reason this restriction on debate is occurring and it would not have occurred had it not been for the fact amendments were put down by my honourable friends from Shipley and Christchurch, and it is absolutely trying to restrict scrutiny. Even at this last stage, with the deputy Leader of the House now back in his .. He is the Minister for agriculture now! Sorry, I do apologise! Now I understand entirely while he Hasted -- why he has to be here. I understand that he is now part of this great government machine and when someone on a sofa at in Downing Street decide something, it has to be forced through. I do apologise for misunderstanding why he is sitting on the bench. Just to go back to the Minister, she is doing a fine  but if she believes her own argument today that it is uncontroversial, why not just withdraw the programme motion and that the House take its own course? The Minister would then be a staff of Parliament. -- a star. It would show the public that the Government is not afraid of scrutiny. I am grateful for giving way, with the honourable gentleman agree that there quickest way to get through the business this afternoon is for the Minister to agree with all bar amendments and we can move on to ? We may not get too many of the debates because of the restriction  and I would have thought... There is disagreement here, wouldn't it just be easier to withdraw the second programme  go back to the original programme motion which went through without dissent? I am looking to the Minister in the hope she will rise to her feet to agree to that. We will have to see whether the House divides, but this is another case of the Executive doing what it wants at the expense of Parliament. It is a shame of this government and not what I expected when this new government came to power. What they promised beforehand has not come to pass in relation to Parliamentary scrutiny. As soon as we get to the business of the House committee which runs Parliament, this place will be far better. Does the Minister wish to respond? No. The question that is, the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill as on the  As many as are of the  say "aye". To the contrary, . I think the ayes habit. -- have that it.

With regard to the purposes of the three men and standing in my name, -- the three amendments are standing in my name, it is important to give some  I should stay -- I should say at the start I have no interest to declare with this Bill, but I do have considerable experience to  Before entering Parliament  I spent the previous 12 years working for Asda. I spent four years working in store and eight years working at the head office in Leeds. I have some first- hand knowledge of how the supermarket industry works. To be  it works in a completely different way to the one people might be forgiven for thinking it works if they had listened to previous debates on this matter. What we have been given to believe is that what happens is a we have a  shocking, nasty supermarkets who care nothing about their suppliers. That their only role in life is to screw their suppliers into the ground and leave them destitute, hopefully bankrupt, is what you would believe having listened to previous debates. And the only way to prevent this from happening is to have this ridiculous adjudicator. That is the premise of this particular bill. The whole thing is an utter  that is not how it works  Will you give way? By have raised this point in the past, because of the power of the supermarkets they are able to say to suppliers, provide this product at this price at your cost all we will go somewhere else. Does he not accept that is unacceptable? I'm afraid to say the honourable gentleman is highlighting the misconceptions. There is already a grocery code of practice enforceable by the Office of Fair  The code of practice that the honourable gentleman talks about it is already in place. It is already there under the auspices of the Office of Fair Trading. If the honourable gentleman has any concerns about has supermarkets are  he can take the complaint to the Office of Fair Trading and ask them to investigated. The adjudicator is not going to be introducing a new code of practice, the code of practice already exist. If the honourable gentleman has evidence of supermarkets breaking the Code  I would be happy for him to come forward and tell me  If anyone has evidence, let's hear today and we can decide on the best course of action. There is no evidence the code of practice has been breached. I say with all  he fails to understand one of the fundamentals of the debate which did take place on committee which is many of the individual examples of abuse within supply chain happens to primary producers who were literally afraid of coming forward. That is why anonymity and protection of those he can give of abuses of over code  This is ultimately... Of course I will give way. I do respect the position he takes on  but he cannot ignore the fact that in 2008, the Competition Commission concluded that supermarkets were transferring excessive risk and cost to suppliers and it was having a detrimental impact on them and  They propose the introduction of the code but made introduction of the code but made introduction of the code but made have some referee to enforce the code otherwise no complaints could be brought forward. He has to accept that fact, simply saying we have to find the evidence ignores the Competition Commission's own conclusions. The honourable gentleman likewise has taken a consistent view on these matters. He wanted an adjudicator before it is a code of practice had even been  He has always been in favour of this solution even when there was not a problem for there to be a solution to. The Office of to be a solution to. The Office of The big supermarkets are big companies with hundreds of stores in their chains. By definition, to be a viable supplier to the supermarket chain, you tend to have to also be a very big company otherwise you do not have the wherewithal to supply a to that particular supplier across all of its premises. What I will come on to in a minute, Mr Speaker, it is about the thresholds at which this particular bill should apply. I think the honourable lady will see that far from it being a big, vast supermarket trying to be awful to a small supplier, it is far from it. Many of the suppliers are actually bigger than the supermarkets. The honourable lady ought to bear that in mind. I think he misunderstands the whole of the supply chain in the UK in that there are those who provide a hub to supply supermarkets, but those hopes are then themselves provided for by very small  Family firms, family producers and they are microscopic in comparison to the size of the supermarket. If he has a big problem with the  so to speak, being the dairy industry for example, then he may pursue his complaint with the middleman rather than having a go at a supermarket. The honourable gentleman opposite earlier made a point about special offers. We had this view that what was happening in the supermarket industry was that supermarkets were telling suppliers that they must do a special offer, they must do a buy one get one free, they must do a three for two, that kind of thing. Suppliers were having this forced upon them against their will. Let me tell you from somebody who has worked in this environment what happens in the Royal world. Rather than this invented world that people want us to hear about. -- the real world. He will know this as well as I do. He worked for as that at the same time as I did and he will recall at the time, before  that as they actually decided that it did not want to do special offers any more, it decided it would not have any special offers in its stores at all. It did not want any buy one get one free offers or anything. It just that his suppliers, rather than these  just sell as the product at an everyday low-price. If you want invest in a promotion, let's have it as an everyday low price. The fact of the matter was that,  it wasn't people like the supermarket forcing suppliers to do  it was suppliers falling over themselves to want to do special offers in the supermarket and put them on a promotional end in the supermarket. Some of these  they have massive marketing  They have marketing budgets that supermarkets would love to have, but simply do not. They use their marketing budget for  They use it to do buy one get  three for the price of  because they are trying to persuade people who perhaps by and low-cost washing powder to move to a higher cost washing powder. In order to persuade them to do that, they will give a buy one get one  I will give way in a  Labour would -- they have their special offer to try and get people to buy the higher-priced washing powder. They hope that by the time the special offer ends, people will stick to that man. It is a way of promoting their brand, it has nothing to do with the supermarket. He is talking about very large  Will he not accept there are smaller companies that are almost totally reliant for their business on supermarkets. Whatever the supermarkets as goes up. Will he not also except that this is one of the things we need to learn from the horsemeat scandal, if you keep driving prices down, some suppliers will look to cut costs by whatever means they can to survive? It seems to me that the honourable gentleman has indicated, and I will take it as such, that he will support my new clause one or clause to because he actually gets to the nub of the point. I suspect he has not bothered to read the amendments because if he had, he would not have leg with his chin in the way that he just did with that particular intervention. I will take it that he will be supporting my amendment. I will make it. -- clear at this point that I would like to put new clause to to a division rather than new clause one, but I will be guided by you and I seek your permission for that. I am grateful former honourable friend for giving way, that I have been looking at new Clause One and new clause to and they are -- and they seem to be the same except for the level of turnover. Is that the case?  my honourable friend is eagle-eyed. The amendments are  but the purpose of tabling to amendment was to give a has a choice. I envisage the interventions of the honourable member opposite in terms of this  To finish my previous point, what we found at as there was a huge reluctance on the part of suppliers to stop special offers. They did not want to stop offers, they were lobbying of the supermarkets saying that they wanted to do more special offers to promote their brand. Everyday low- price did not offer them the same opportunity as a special offers it. I applaud his campaign to get his whites whiter, but he must recognise that there is a fundamental difference between a washing powder changing brand and a supplier that supplies a cauliflower or a carrot or a parsnip because it is not possible to brand the carrot or a cauliflower. I am grateful to my honourable friend and I am taking his intervention as a signal that he will support my amendment in this regard as well. That brings us on .. I don't wish to interrupt for any length of time, but above all, I would not want a house to be inadvertently misled. The honourable gentleman has no amendments in this group, but he does have a series of new clauses  if memory serves me, in his name and the member for Bury North. New clauses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. On  with beady eyes, the House will now focus. You are absolutely right, as ever. It is new clauses 1 and 2 that it seems my honourable friend is indicating he is prepared to support and I will be grateful for  It seems that the longer we  the more support I am garnering for my case. So are encouraged to go on a bit more. He is being very generous, that he should also recognise that in putting a figure on turnover, once again there will be a difference between somebody supplying a low- value product like a carrot and a high-value product like a bottle of  In putting a firm figure  as time loose-forward and inflation moves forward, that figure will become smaller and smaller and that threshold will actually drag in smaller medium- sized enterprises.

This idea that supermarkets are screwing suppliers into the ground remorselessly and hoping that as many of them as possible will go  It is a nonsensical argument. On the specific point, with regard to evidence of what has happened so  has the current grocery coping well utilised since his introduction? I honourable friend makes a good  He actually strikes to the part of why it -- to the heart of why this Bill is nonsense. There is no evidence that the grocery code is being abused. Nobody has yet been able to come forward on any  The fact remains, there are not any cases, no evidence that the grocery code is not being applied properly.  as the competition authorities have repeatedly found, in this particular sector, there is a significant climate of fear and that is the reason why, until the adjudicating is in place, it is highly unlikely that anybody will use the existence of the code. I ask the honourable gentleman to look at clauses 4, 10 and 12 of the bill macro itself which I think should give the reassurance that I believe he is looking for, that any potentially powerful supplier would not be abusing their power because of the reasonableness which is a golden lion which runs through this bill. I don't want to get on to parts of the bill which were subject to amendments in groups lower down so I will resist that temptation, if I  but the point is that  supermarkets can only offer properly with the goodwill of  There are often cases  for example, a supplier has a problem at short notice.

That is what  They go to another supplier and say, we have empty  can you help us out. Do people think that those suppliers will help out a supermarket that is trying to turn them into a bankrupt firm or screw them into the ground? Of course they would not. My honourable friend make the points that he thinks my limits may help - - may impede small businesses he turned over billion pounds per year. All I can say is, my word, supermarkets must be a force for good if they can turn small enterprises into funds with a billion pounds on turnover. That should be something to celebrate supermarkets for, not criticise  I think we would all be delighted to be companies of that  I'm not sure which ones he the -- he is thinking of, but it he as any examples that he is worried they have a turnover of at a billion pounds per year, I would like to meet them and find out what their fears of. Can he illustrate, for the house, what he thinks would be a billion pounds worth of cauliflowers? I honourable friend makes a good  This strikes and the heart of my particular new clauses 1 and  The point is this, we can argue about the necessity of this bill. It is not only an necessary, as my honourable friend made Clear, it is a solution looking for a problem,  basically, the most am conservative-minded thing that you could ever possibly see. I have no problem with the Lib Dems supporting it and the left wing  I am worried about people on my own side supporting an intervention on the free-market were two companies make an agreement and we, in this house, think we should intervene in the contract that they both entered into freely and say, we don't think you should sign that. I always thought companies were capable of deciding those things for themselves. I think he miss understands the concept of what the adjudicator is trying to achieve. That is exactly the point he makes an that when an agreement is made, if both sides stick to that agreement, there is not a problem, but it is when one side tries to change that agreement and goes back at a later date.  He seems to be making the point that this is unnecessary. If people signed a contract, I am not a lawyer, Mr Speaker, but my Honourable friends beside me are and about to their expertise, but it seems to me that if two sides signed a contract and one side breaks the contract, there is already law in place to make sure that can be seen through in the  The court will make sure a contract entered into voluntarily  We don't need to do  We already have the OFT that looks after the grocery code, which Does he accept the reason many on this side believes this Bill is important is because of the imbalance in power, economic power and power in the relationships between these small suppliers and the supermarkets? That would be very much demonstrated in a corporate setting poor resources available to very large supermarkets are vastly disproportionate to small suppliers. This is a red letter day for me because we now have another volunteer to support my new clauses  The may well not have read what they are, but if I am allowed to get on to the part of what is in clauses 1 and 2, we will find he is actually agreeing with the point I  In terms of new clauses  at this Bill was sold on the premise that the honourable gentleman has just articulated. That we have massive supermarkets which are in a vastly preferential situation against a very small  What we should be doing is looking after these very small  That is the premise that the honourable gentleman is indicating, it is what my honourable friend is indicating. That is what the whole point of this Bill was sold upon. I am happy, I am the first to accept that even though I believe this is on  this is a minority view. What my new clauses seek to do is to make sure the Bill actually hits the purpose which it was given in the first place, to look after small suppliers which my honourable friend is rightly keen to wished to look after. What this Bill currently does, it does not just look at a small suppliers, it actually gives an avenue for complaint to all suppliers of supermarkets whatever their size. All I can do is reiterate the fact that the vast majority of suppliers to supermarkets are a huge companies in their own right. What are these suppliers hope from this the adjudicator, Mr Speaker, there is only one thing the suppliers have hope for up from this the adjudicator and that is that ultimately they hope this will deliver a benefit to their bottom  That is what suppliers are  Whichever Avenue it is done through, this will make sure suppliers have a healthier bottom line in the future. I will give way to my honourable friend. He must also recognise that the adjudicator's role is as a referee. If one of these large corporations are any disagreement with a  then the supermarket could use the groceries code adjudicated to make sure they are getting a fair deal from that  The honourable gentleman makes his point. I am a Conservatives. They know it is an old-fashioned view these days within the Conservative Party, but I believe in the free market. I believe that companies like Asda,  Morrisons, they are big enough to look after themselves. They do not need a referee to look after a contract on their behalf. They are more than capable of doing that themselves. My honourable friend may take the point it is the role of Parliament to intervene between every negotiation between two companies. He may think that this House's role is to intervene in all sorts of contract disputes. Why limit it to supermarkets? There are lots of industries were one big person negotiate a deal with smaller suppliers. It seems to me that my honourable friend is arguing for a total business ombudsman that looks at every contract negotiated, that is not the kind of country air want to  I will give way. The honourable gentleman has been very  This batch of clauses that he is supporting, including new clause 3, is essentially a free-market option. That is what it  Did he listen to Radio 4 at the other morning when Billy Bragg was being interviewed? He made the comment that when you leave everything to the free-market, you end up with horsemeat. I have no doubt the honourable gentleman does not believe in the free market, that is why he sits on the other side of the House. I have no quibble with him are not agreeing with the Honourable bill. What I object to his people on that this side of the House. He has clearly painted a picture that the supermarkets are very fair, they have the best interests of everybody at heart, but so what were they have to fear? They have not done anything wrong and would never do anything wrong according  I heard in a Westminster whole debate, one of my honourable friends who is in favour of this, he made it abundantly clear he thought this the adjudicator would have nothing to do. They would just be there in case they were needed at some point in the future. It is totally on necessary. I do not believe in creating unnecessary  I find these things end up being Empire buildings. They start of small and targeted, them when they find out they have nothing to do, they find something  When going to make a bit of  Mr Speaker. These are the same people who were going to vote to restrict the debate. They were happy for that debate to be restricted to three hours and now want to try and prolong the debate for as long as possible. If they still want to come back at a future point I will try to allow them in, but I'm sure there are other people who would like to speak. This was supposed to support small suppliers, so let's make it clear on the face of the Bill that that is what this Bill is going to do. New clause 1 and new clause to, a new clause one says that the adjudicators could not have cases referred to them by, or on behalf of companies if their turnover exceeds £500 million the  New clause to is exactly the same only it is a £1 billion the  I have done some investigations to work out what sort of companies would be covered by my amendment so we can see what we are talking about. Then perhaps the Minister can tell us whether or not the purpose behind this Bill was to help these particular  Coming back to the point I was making, suppliers are hoping this will help their bottom line. Who pays for an increase in the bottom line of a supplier? It will not be the supermarket. This idea that supermarket profits will be  it is basically a transfer of wealth, there will be some kind of magical transfer of wealth from the supermarket to the supplier where the supermarket will give up its profits and it will all feed through and go to these small  It does not work like that. Supermarkets work to very low  The whole purpose of them is basically a volume, it is about cutting prices and increasing  That is how they increase their profit. If it benefits the suppliers bottom-line, it will only come from one person and that is because it were. The consumer will end up paying more for their  If people want to go round and tell their constituents they are voting for them to pay more for their products, I am happy for them  At least they are being  I respect that. I will give  My honourable friend is incredibly sensible. Companies we are talking about here are a large  They are multi- billion dollar multinational corporations.

I am grateful to my honourable friend who knows a great deal about this particular subject. If people want to transfer money it to suppliers from supermarkets, in an idealistic  or in the will world from their constituents, let them go out  But if they reject my clauses today, I want them to be clear with their constituents who they are benefiting with their higher prices. My honourable friend gave a quick list of some of the  I will give a more extensive list. We are talking in terms of suppliers in terms to supermarkets, companies like Esso who supply petrol to supermarkets. Are we in this situation, do people here who support this Bill, have they really got in mind that they want is facilitated Esso? The company far bigger than any supermarket chain. Is that the purpose of this bill, so at Esso can go with their complaint to the adjudicator and they adjudicator can faff about, is that really what this bill is about? The the honourable gentleman's argument seems to be on the premise there is  so why on earth would there be a problem between the these great corporations? I will try to say it in more simple terms for the benefit of the honourable  I do not agree with them the  If we are going to have a  I want the Bill to focus on the people that I think she had in mind when she thought she would support this bill. If anybody here wants to stand up and intervened to say that when they supported this  the first company they had in mind was at Esso, let them stand up and intervene. Mr Speaker, it pains me to point out to my honourable friend that petrol is not a grocery, it is not covered by the code and this point is spurious. I'm grateful to the honourable  perhaps then we could go to Proctor and Gamble. Would they be covered by this? Is that a spurious point? When he had this Bill in mind, when he was going round telling all the farmers how marvellous it would be, it did he  either way, one of the biggest suppliers to supermarkets who will have at most opportunity to benefit from this, who could be clogging up the adjudicator with complaints is Proctor and Gamble. Did my honourable friend tell them that is who he had in mind, I do not think he did this.The honourable gentleman is misrepresenting the role of the grocery code adjudicator. When the deal is done between two suppliers, large or small, as long as that deal is stuck to their is no role for the grocery adjudicators. That deal will stand fast. The adjudicator gets involved when the supermarket goes back and tries to change that original agreement, and that is where their role has placed. So my honourable friend does nothing Procter and Gamble are big enough to look after themselves? He thinks they need a government stated adjudicators to intervene on their behalf? Because the poor mites might find themselves in an on furniture association with a  I think the key here is there is a general consensus that we are on the side of David Knott de Lyon. It seems sensible to me that you amendments would focus on day that and not support coli  I'm grateful to my honourable friend. Nobody was saying this was supposed to benefit Procter and Gamble. As my honourable friend says, if we want the adjudicators time freed up to look after small suppliers, we do not want their time taken up by multinational corporations. I'm going to say something that may be controversial. I was saying this. If supermarkets are going around screwing Proctor and Gamble into the ground to get the cheapest possible price to pass on to their  I say, good on them. Their profits are not going to be massively impacted, I once supermarkets to negotiate robustly with big companies to get the price down for my constituents. The party  they were supposed to be supportive of the working person. The people on fixed incomes. They are going to vote today to have Proctor and Gamble's interests protected over the interests of their constituents. What on earth has the Labour Party come to know when it is on the side of Procter  We have green energy Fuel Limited, Imperial Tobacco Gallacher Ltd, these are the top suppliers to supermarkets. I might say that those people in naivety who think the adjudicator is not going to empire built are living in A minute ago he was talking about his clauses and has since taken interventions that have caused the debates to glide into a second reading consideration and I know the honourable gentleman will want to return to the terms of his new  on which he can expand at such length as he thinks fit, which I'm sure he will. Point of order, Mr Speaker. It may be of some help to be aware that to the amendment it refers specifically to the grocery Supply Code order and many of the elements that the gentleman is introducing into his speech had no connection whatsoever with that grocery Supply  They may supply to supermarkets, but they do not fall into the remit of grocery. I am grateful to the honourable  but I thought I had adequately make the point myself that the honourable gentleman would wish to return to the terms of his new clauses. I think that people ought to be aware that this bill lives a great deal of scope for the adjudicator themselves to decide what they are going to be doing so people should not have great faith in all these  This bill deliberately gives the adjudicator massive amounts of free power. Just to speed things up, and we have limited time because a house decided on the programme motion, I have noticed that the minister has been deep in conversation and looking at these amendments, I wonder if the minister is likely to intervene and accept new clause two and then we can move on? My honourable friend is from from  but I am afraid, in my  logic is never usually the great winner in these particular debates, Mr Speaker. Particularly when it comes to the government unless they come up with the idea themselves, they seem reluctant to accept other  Let's carry on, Walkers  Perhaps we think this bill should be directed at Walkers snack Foods. Coca-Cola, a small firm that needs looking after when it comes in a busy Nations. My honourable friend refers to Walkers snack Foods. One of the raw materials that companies uses a lot of his potatoes, but there is nothing in the bill that would protect the suppliers of potatoes to walkers. Where honourable friend makes a  It would still allow walkers to screw the potatoes supply into the ground as much as  in terms of providing  but it would stop the supermarket from being able to negotiate the best deal with Walkers crisps for their particular  Coca-Cola, Heinz limited. Do they really need to take complaints to an adjudicator? Although not big enough to look after themselves? Why are we passing legislation to intervene in a dispute between the big supermarket and a big supplier like Heinz? United Biscuits, Qatar food.  Premiere foods. Brick  Are we really saying that it has come to the point that we actually have to, in this house, set up a state regulator to intervene in problems, negotiations or disputes between massive, multinational companies that have perfectly proper recourse of the courts if they feel a contract has been breached? Will we saying that Heinz does not have the wherewithal to take it these to the court if they fill a supplier has dealt with them unfairly? Does anybody want to stand up and say that they think Heinz does not have the wherewithal to take their case to court if they fill a contract has been breached? He wants to make that point? I will happily challenge him on  That is exactly the  those large companies have the ability to negotiate a deal, and that will be structured and the grocery coda adjudicator will not get involved in those sorts of negotiations. It is whether supermarket tries to go back on the deal and change it at a later date whether grocery code adjudicator  We all know that is the  My point is this, if Heinz or walkers or less may or Coca-Cola or any of these fans feel that the supermarket has actually breached a contract they have signed into, they can take their case to court. We don't need the states to set up and the adjudicator in order to decide whose side to fall on. As it  personally, I am quite relaxed about supermarkets trying to screw these big suppliers into the ground to get the best deal. These companies are making huge profits and I would prefer to see that benefit my constituents rather then benefit the bottom line of these big companies. I think the honourable gentleman is  in truth, arguing the case for the abolition of all of the competition authorities because that is the direction of the  where he is taking the  The fact is, Clause Four makes it clear that investigations would be a decision made on balance of reasonableness by the adjudicator themselves. Clause 10 makes it clear that costs would be awarded against any supplier that brought a complaint and properly and was found to be without merit. It is quite clear that the Competition Commission in their final report said that the resources of the competition of the  as it was declared then, offers to focus on those disputes and complaints concerning suppliers without market power over and above those concerning suppliers of major branded products that have market  That doesn't paragraph 48. It is quite clear that that balance decision as to be made by the adjudicator themselves and I am perfectly content that the bill has the capacity to ensure that. I'll was loath to interrupt their Honourable Member in mid-flow, but it seems to me that interventions are becoming longer. There is no problem with a frequency, but there is with length.The honourable gentleman of again misreads the bill as to what is actually in it. We will come on to those in future groups of amendments in terms of recovery of investigation costs. It does not say they have to be  it says they may be  He seems to have huge faith in allow mid- adjudicator to do as they please. I don't want the adjudicate said to do as they  I want them to have some strict rules that they have to  That is part of the purpose of my amendments. On that specific  the adjudicator would have finite resources so surely it would be better to focus that on smaller  those who do not have the confidence to take on the  Absolutely. That is the purpose of the bill. Given that these big multinational companies are the biggest suppliers to supermarkets, supply the biggest volume of products to them, not only in terms of the 40,000 or so products on sale at any one time, the companies that have the most scope to benefit from this particular bill of the big multinational companies. Why on earth we want to do that, I don't  Nobody has yet said why Heinz cannot take contract disputes to court if they so please. No one has given an argument as to why they can't afford to and we need an adjudicator to act on their behalf. They do not need energy to data, they are big enough and bad enough to look after their own interests without an adjudicator having to  So are the supermarkets. When we have an agreement between a huge multinational supermarket and a huge multinational supplier, such  let them get on with it. If they then have some kind of Raul among themselves as to who has broken a particular role because,  the supermarkets need the suppliers as much as the suppliers need the supermarket, one could not manage without the other, let them get on with it themselves. Why are we legislating to actually get involved in their dispute? It is completely ridiculous. If those people who are arguing for the grocery could adjudicate, as people in this house are, then they say it is to help small suppliers, this is their opportunity to make it abundantly clear that this Bill is for smaller suppliers to supermarkets by supporting my new clause is either one or two. I will make the point as to why half a billion and a billion and wire wool  with your position, new clause to do a division. It is a billion pounds. Why? I have given the reasons to which some of the pliers -- suppliers which will be covered by that, but the point is, the grocery goaded Judith 80 applies to retailers with a turnover of over £1 billion. In  what the bill is saying is that if your turnover is over £1  you are a big, huge organisation that other people need protecting from. And that you are  to begin any kind of contract negotiation and therefore we need to put some kind of limit  some kind of backstop in  All I would say it is, if a supermarket that has a turnover of over £1 billion per year is big enough to look after itself and other people don't need any help  surely suppliers with a turnover of over a billion pounds are in the same situation? Why is it that the supermarket with a high turnover is too big in order to be trusted to me is yet properly, but the supplier with a turnover of over £1 billion is too small and needs protecting by the role of an adjudicator? Where is the logic in that? De honourable gentleman is about to tell us the logic behind it. We have all been listening very carefully to what he is saying, but the two things that are important are the amendments put forward are not backed by the industry. The food and drink registration and the brand group do not support the restrictions on his new clauses.  it has to be stated quite clearly that I do have some sympathy to him going further than the supply chain that those amendments are accepted at  He is saying that he is in minds to support my new clauses 1 and 2 because the food and drink industry that represents these massive suppliers are going to benefit from the adjudicator. The food and drink industry don't support it! Of course they would support it because they are trying to look after the interest and pay the bills for the food and drink  Can the honourable gentleman not maker's decision himself? Can he not think for himself what the equation is? Supermarkets with turnover of £1 billion need somebody to look after the interest of their suppliers. That is what he is saying. Suppliers of over £1 billion, why did they need help? Why did they need help if the retailer with a turnover of over a billion pounds does not need help? This is a nonsensical position for anyone to  I notice we have to Lib Dem members on the front bench, they are used to nonsensical positions. They made a political career out of nonsensical decisions, but what I asked his people on the Conservative benches who have some common sense, to think about this for a second and what they are  I as members in the Labour party opposite to think  Who is it a they were sent here to represent? Weather Centre to represent the interest of mass and suppliers? No, surely they were here to represent the interests of their constituents. Constituents worried about the cost of living and do not want to see prices put up unnecessarily to add to the bottom line. The whole thing is nonsensical and my amendment tries to make sure this Bill serve the purpose for which it is these decisions are arbitrary as to what's an appropriate length of  I put in seven years. This is to give this Bill a chance. It will give this Bill a chance to see how it works in practice. My honourable friend for Sherwood made the point that if supermarkets stick to their agreement, there would be nothing for the adjudicator to do, in effect. They will be paying them a huge salary to do nothing, which seems to me a bizarre situation to want to put ourselves in, but there we go. It seems to me it may well be there's lots of complaints, and it is working fantastically and suppliers are happy with it and small suppliers and the rest of it. Well, in seven years' time let the Bill expire and we can decide for ourselves whether or not it was a good or a bad thing. We could come back and decide whether the threshold I want to put this is worth putting back in again if we agree to it today or worth inserting if we don't. All of the fears I have, if they turn out to be not true, all of that can be resolved 2010 Bill has to come back in seven years' time when we look  If my fears are proved to be correct and people accept that some of the concerns I hold  that could be dealt with that the point why. Would we want to box ourselves into something that I think is a waste of time. Let's have a sunset clause and we can deal with the Government and any anomalies to ensure that a future Bill is fit for purpose. In considering whether to support new clause 3, I'm right in understanding that in seven years'  if this adjudicator hadn't had to do anything and it has been superflewous it will fade away, whereas if it has been really good, Prime Minister Cameron had his 21st  will be able to reintroduce the Bill? He is right. He knows that if such a sunset clause isn't introduced into the Bill, even if it is shown to be a waste of time and an expensive bureaucracy, it will carry on endlessly. This Bill will give us the mechanics to get rid of it if it is seen to be  And if it is seen to be so unnecessary, as my honourable friend says it might and who knows,  I don't think it will, but it might, people can bring it  They'll be anxious to have that legislation in place to bring  This will stop some ridiculous white elephant carrying on in perpetuity when it is not  I might say in passing that it would seem to me to be a sensible provision if more Bills had a sunset clause so we could analyse whether or not they've been worthwhile and done what they say on the tin. My intention in this group of amendments has been to focus on new clauses 1 and 2. With your permission I would like to put new clause 2 to a gifplgts white put the same £1 billion threshold on suppliers as applies in the grocery code adjudicator bill for retailers  There seems to be no good reason for me why the figures shouldn't apply both sides. I intend to thaul to a division. We can all then see who has gone in to look after the interests of multinational suppliers and who want their constituents to pay more of their shopping to in order to benefit the companies' bottom line. I don't think I was sent to Parliament to boost the profits of Mars or Nestle. I want my constituents to pay the lowest amount necessary to buy their products in the supermarket. They are already struggling with the cost of living. How ridiculous it would be if we were putting legislation in place to make them pay more than they need to when they are struggling to pay the bills as it is. I hope that the Government will see sense and realise that the same equation should apply on both sides of the supply chain, to retailers and  I hope they will. I hope they will listen to reason. If they  I hope the House will force The question that the clause be read a second time. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. I will  I want to deal with  tabled in my name and my other colleagues as well. Can I just give the brief background to tabling this amendment and the noers my name. I chair the parliamentary group, the Bakers and Allies Workers, which trepts workers within the baking and confectionery industry. We've had a long campaign over a number of years now about our concerns about below-cost selling in the baking and confectionery sector. Again it reflects the general nature of the  I raised this at second  I don't delay the House more than to simply explain that the same pressure from supermarkets on supplies has had its effects within the baking industry as it has in farming and elsewhere. There is the pressure to cut costs  The impact on the product has been to reduce quality. There's been concerns about the safety of ingredients over the years. In fact, some of the arguments that have been put forward by some of the consumer organisations the deterioration and the quality of bread and the significant element of water that the been introduced into the bread production. That's undermined the nutritional gaeft can be obtained from eating bread, and hate its impact on the health of the population. There is an angstkhit that same pressure has been -- anxiety that that same pressure has been applied to the  It has led to a reduction in wages and cuts in jobs. It has reduced pay overall. This has now become a sector where there's significant levels of low pay. In fact it is one of the most low-paid sectors in our industry at the  It has had impact on deteriorating conditions of work and terms of employment. Bake verse expressed their concern that in many ways hate undermined the skills within the sector too, as the pressure is to undermine the potential of people to be upskilled and therefore as a result of that increase their wages. These are very vulnerable workers and they are fearful of raising their concerns about what's happening within their sector. That's why the bakers union, combined with employers and others, welcome this  They felt it gave them protection when they blew the whistle on some of the practices undertaken by supermarkets to put pressure that would deteriorate the conditions within their industry. That's the background to the amendment itself. The bakers union welcomed clause 13 of the Bill, which enables the adjudicator to recommend to the Office of Fair Trading changes to the code over time as issues arise. However, it is important that this process is seen to be open and transparent. And that's what amendment 3 seeks  It simply ensures that the office of fair trading is required to publish it response to the Rex dayss coming forward from a review by the -- the recommendations coming forward from the adjudicator. And in that response to explain whether the OFT has acted on those recommendations or not. It is simply a process of openness and transparency that will lead to accountability. It will place a statutory duty on the office of fair trading to make its functions if patently open to scrutiny from the general public and the industry  My honourable friend will come on to amendments I hope on 34 and 35 which will relate to the wider concerns that we now have about the nutritional content of some of the consumer goods placed  This will respond to some of that element of concerns that people have about the ensuring that when recommendations are made that will have an impact on improving the nutrition of our  improving the operation within a particular food sect or, they are acted upon. If not acted  reasons are given why. I thank the honourable member for giving  Is he aware that members on this side of the House tried to strengthton relationship between the groceries code adjudicator and  and we were given unsatisfactory reassurances for example that the publicly available telephone line could be used by the groceries code adjudicator to contact the OFT? So can I say to the honourable member that any measures that strengthton relationship between the OFT and the groceries code adjudicator must be welcomed? I followed the dialogue that took place in committee and read the minute of the committee. It is one of the joys of my life over the last couple of months. I appreciated the response from the Minister. Let me deal with those, if I may. The Minister's response was that an amendment like this would be  would not provide any additional force to the legislation  It was suggested that if the OFT repeatedly failed to act on the adjudicator's recommendations two routes would be available. One would be the Select Committee, which which would have a role to  And secondly, any supplier could judicially review the OFT, particularly with regard to whether the OFT was behaving reasonably or the Act's duties. I find the response - I didn't want to comment on the hotline issue, because it was too bizarre, to say the least. I took it to be just part of the knock-about of committee that people undertake just to keep themselves awake. Let me deal with the judicial review. Of course it is open to any supplier to do that. It is virtually impossible to succeed on reasonableness ground, particularly with the powers that the OFT has and the broad range of the adjudicator in this matter. I can't see that as a constructive route to go down. In addition, the length of time that would take wouldn't address the immediacy of some of the recommendations that the adjudicator would have. With regard to Select Committees, of course they have a role, but they have no direction force -- directional force. The report and recommendation, it takes time for their recommendation to be accepted and moved into practice. I just say this to the Minister. I understand her responses at committee. She doesn't want to over burden the  I understand that. The whole issue about the public concern about the nutritional content of the consumer goods placed before us, with the horsemeat scandals et cetera, I think that the world has moved on. What people are expecting the Government to be now is decisive but open and transparent in the way that they are moving forward to tidy up the mess around the horsemeat scandal. Understand the alarm in how we put in process a -- and long term in how we put in process the monitoring of supermarkets and the supply chain and make sure that where we have a structure in place it operates  transparently and effectively. That's what this amendment seeks to do. I think if we can't actually place a duty on the OFT simply to report whether it has acted or not on a recommendation of the groceries code adjudicator it emstraits the weakness of this legislation. It is simply asking the OFT to say whether or not they've acted on the recommendation. It doesn't even require a detailed report of the reasons why and why not. Thing would most probably follow at a  if a recommendation has been rejected. I think there would be a public clamour for that. This is just a minor amendment which in the current climate I think would be expected of this House to support. For that reason Mr Deputy Speaker, if time permits, I would like to seek a division on Thank you very much for the opportunity to say a few words on this particular group of amendments.  with care, to my honourable friend, the member for Shipley's reasons for moving these  I start by saying I fully accept the logic of saying that there are some very, very large food producers in the world whose market dominance is such that they do not need the protection of this legislation. What I would add,  is that if you read the legislation carefully, the Bill we have before us, then I believe that there are sufficient measures within that - or clauses and references within it - that would ensure that that - the examples that my honourable friend gave wouldn't actually come to pass. I remind him of the point I made and I was endorsed in a different way by the an honourable member that this is purely about the Groceries Code Adjudicator. A number of the businesses he listed may partly be involved in groceries. But he preferred to Proctor and Gamble. Many of their products are not  Many rsome are not. The other thing to consider when you look at these big multinational  is quite often their trading arms are much smaller organisations. They may be part of a multinational conglomerate, but as a supplier they may be individually a much smaller organisation. But I wanted to also add a couple of other points, if I  Mr Deputy Speaker, recognising that other honourable members will want to come. In I wanted to refer to -- come in. I wanted to rerve to the point of prefer to the point of principle thatmy honourable member referred to those who are also Conservative MPs but also support the Bill because he talked about being in favour of a fre market. I too am in favour of a free market, but I also believe a fair market. If you take a free market to its extreme and my honourable friend got close to this, then you would end up with one retailer and one  That is the eventual end. The game of monopoly is the arch example of a total uneffected free  -- unfetted. I believe markets have to be regulated. But not totally but where there is imbalance I believe it is necessary. I would remind my honourable friend of Adam Smith a great philosopher  He said a true market is one where there is an equal number of suppliers and purchasers. I thank my honourable friend for  This is the point about the amendments. It would focus time, resources and attention on those suppliers who we need to protect to make sure there isn't a monopoly situation from the point. Suppliers. I'm coming to that specific point. I am responding, though, to the more philosophical point to which my honourable friend, the member for Shipley referred. While he was quite clear that he did not see those of us who share these benches with him as true Conservatives if we supported this Bill, a view which I want to totally reyou but  because I think this is rebutt. Because I think this is necessary and one of the reasons, to respond to my intervene who has just  one of the reasons is despite the honourable member for Shipley's comments, there are plenty of examples where supermarkets are exceeding what I believe to be fair terms of trade. He will understand that during my time in office I had a number of meetings with one or sometimes several supermarket chief executives together and most of them and indeed other senior directors and officials from supermarkets would argue, as he has  that there is no need for  that they are already doing everything fairly and above board and properly, to which I have to say - I can only conclude that many chief executives do not know what is being done in their name by people operating much further down the chain and reference has been made to buyers. The fact is that there are numerous examples, quite recent examples, since the code  in 2010, of, for example, requiring - verbally requiring suppliers to use a nominated  despite the fact that the supplier may be able to find an equally good and competent haulier to do the job for less money. But the supermarket has decided that there has to be a particular  Of examples where a supermarket, noting that a particular supplier may have made a significant profit, in one particular year, instead of coming along saying - we think you are being excessive and therefore we think we should pay you next year a slightly lower price for your  with which we could all  They actually go along and say - we want a cheque now, on the 5 million or more in order that we will consider doing business with you next year. That,  is not acceptable or in anyway a moral way of doing  And that is why I strongly believe that they need to be investigated. I also wanted to make the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, that although understandably the debate has ranged over a number of different types of commodities, some within and some outside. Most of us would understand that the biggest issue is within the fresh produce sector, where there have been most glaring examples of the instances to which I have just referred and no doubt other honourable members would do so. My honourable friend for Shipley also said that if the supermarket adjudicator has nothing to do, then he believes this would be - the whole thing is a waste of time. My attitude is somewhat different. I would actually be delighted if the adjudicator proved to have nothing  because it would demonstrate that everything was being conducted,  in conjunction - in accordance with the code and that all shriers were being treated  I have to say -- all suppliers were being treated fairly. I have to say to him, I don't believe there is any chance whatsoever of that being the case. I know there are of cases being brought forward already, for the adjudicator to deal with, if this Bill becomes law. I have just described a couple of those  But, to mee, the very threat of it but to me, the very threat of it may well be the answers it our problems, but to suggest that, frankly, there is no  on the basis that the code is there, it is clearly not enforceable through the Office of Fair Trading. That is not the way that it was described. And the final point I would make and I will give way to my honourable friend before doing so, is this: that he seems to ignore the point made by the honourable member for St Ives. That the Competition Commission's very reason for all of this was to look after the consumer. The whole thrust of it was by shifting excessive risk from the retailer to the supplier, he was putting the long-term interests of the consumer at risk and that the result would be that whilst it maybe cheaper  it maybe far more expensive, or not even - possibly non-existent, as a supply in the future. And that is not in the long-term interests of the consumer I will ignore the nonsenseical point that it'll benefit consumers. It is a nonsenseical and idiotic point that this will benefit consumers. We'll skate over that. My honourable friend said he was happy for the adjudicator to have nothing to do and that would be a good outcome. Can he tell us how much the adjudicator is going to be paid? Mr Deputy Speaker, he don't know. It hasn't been made public what the adjudicator is going to be paid. That is a complete irrelevance. It is the - if the existence - it's  We may not need our  if everybody obeyed the law you wouldn't need any judges but we still have them, just in case. I don't think that is a reasonable  The reality is, as I have  Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe there is ample evidence this there are going to be cases for the adjudicator to intervene and to adjudicate on. I have to stress that the Bill contains, within it, a number of aspects whereby, firstly the aJudd Kateor can decide not to take a reference. -- adjudicator. They can fine somebody if the reference they've made noose serious foundation and their job is -- has they've made no serious foundation. I give way. I'm grateful to the honourable gentleman for giving way. Especially given his extensive knowledge of the food sector in his time as a DEFRA minister. I wonder if the heart of the amendment is looking at the power and balance between suppliers and retailers, whether he came across any evidence in his time as a minister, that big suppliers were putting downward pressure on retailers in a way which the honourable gentleman has advanced? The honest answer is the honourable member is I didn't come across such evidence. It may well be happening, I just don't no. As my honourable friend for Shipley properly said, those very big suppliers can look after themselves. I'm not in anyway arguing against  And indeed I would have some sympathy for the point of the amendment two, the £1 billion  Firstly if I thought that my honourable friend's motives for forwarding it were justified and I'm afraid the rest of his argument completely lost any support I might have on that, but  because I believe the Bill  the way it is drafted, will mitigate against big organisations like that using it in any respect. I think the whole way the legislation is properly drafted, --  is designed to attract, to deal with the problems which we've all agreed with, which tend to be for the smaller and mood yum- sized enterprise. I give way. -- medium sized. I'm grateful. I endorse the comments my right honourable friend is making but if he follow the logic of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Shipley, the conclusion you would draw and indeed I have drawn and I would like to have seen this Bill drafted in this manner, and that is to draft it in such a manner that it in fact could be looked both ways,  In other words, what it is seeking to achieve is fair dealing in the supermarket supply  So, if indeed a supplier became overly-powerful, indeed complaints could be made the other  My honourable friend is entirely right, Mr Deputy Speaker.  I condition clued my remarks on this group of events now. I'm grateful to my honourable friend's speech and I have been listening to it carefully because it puts a balance into this debate. I'm very attracted to new clause 2, because the Bill is designed to look after the small guy and not the big gie. Wouldn't it - I don't see the  -- big guy. How, except in two clause 2 would there be a problem? It is entirely for the Government to decide whether to accept new clause 2. It doesn't cause me a huge problem. I believe .. Here, here.But I believe it to be completely unnecessary for the reasons I have described. Nothing I have said in the last few  I think, could be deemed as saying I was against it. I just don't see any need for it. But I certainly believe that there is a very real problem that needs to be  as this Bill seeks to do, which is not basis of my honourable friend's movement of these new  which, as he rightly and properly and honestly said, was despite the fact he doesn't agree with the Bill at all. I do, and  I would like to see it become law as soon as possible. Thank you very much indeed Mr Deputy Speaker. With your permission I would like to move amendments 28, 30, 3334 and 35 in this grouping., make a short contribution to amendment three and perhaps if we have time touch on the amendments proposed. It is a pleasure to follow the member for south-east Cambridge who whose contribution has summed up this  We have cross-party consensus it is right we should take it forward. If I can start with amendment 28 which I think is self-explanatory this, provides when the ajoud Kateor publishes guide sheens just include guidance about which law applies to a arbitration and where it should be  This is important in the context of suppliers perhaps from being in remote parts of the UK.

The scheme provides for the application of certain arbitration rules and for London is the default location. Sections five and six makes were visions for amendments of the scheme and this... However it'll be important for suppliers and retailers to be given stat true triguidance on the law apolitically correctable to arbitrations. This amendment requires the aJudd Kateor it issue such guidance. -- aJudd Kateor. Amendment 30 and 33 would require the adjudicator to give advance notice to subsidiaries. Amendment  Mr Deputy Speaker, appears to be a duplicate to one of the other  amendment 30 but if if it goes into the Bill twice I'm think we would move amendment 33. This amendment aims to raise the issue that the code doesn't cover areas in the supply chain where there are abuses. In terms of, for example Asda had a subsidiary IPL which sources 100% of their product requirements, and it goes to the point made by the honourable member Shipley that the point of the groceries code and the adjudicator is to try and even the balance of power between these two relationships. Off than balance of power can be on the other side. I'm disappointed that the Member for St Ives didn't press his amendments in  It is clear that the adjudicator has a role to address and remedy any abusive purchasing practices which are perpetuated by  This would include a significant number of overseas suppliers it is vital to address the adverse effect on competition, identified by the Competition Commission in 2008, where they said there was evidence of risk passed back to the suppliers. That's been nexted by all sides of the House. We are concerned that the increase of retailers setting is up sourcing  for example Asda have set  International Procurement and Logistics Limited. There's a strong case for the groceries code adjudicator bill to include these organisations in the scope who make decisions on price, volume and payment processes et cetera for these products to end up on retailers' shelves. There's a strong international perspective. They've been seeking a resolution to ensure that retailers trade fairly with overseas producers since well before the code was envisaged or delivered. UK supermarkets buy a significant volume of products overseas...THE SPEAKER: Mr George, surely you are not listening to a message in the  I hope it is switched off.  Mr Deputy Speaker, we've mentioned the excessive risks to  particularly overseas. These would have had the potential to harm those who are most  farm and farm workers in developing countries. UK shoppers widely enjoy a wide range  This Bill has the opportunity to ensure that there is protection for all territories and make a large contribution the development of other countries and the contribution this can make to their development. This amendment is asking for the code to Becks tended to other territories and asking the adjudicator to look at  The subsidiaries issue is worth exploring, as the large retailers have different arrangements in case. That's what this amendment is intended to do. It would be good to get clarity from the Minister on what the process would be if there is identification of difficulty with regards to the code in these other subsidiaries or territories. The relationship of the code and the complex matrix of buying and production is from the large retail tore the immediate supplier. This means that the larger retail ser able to set up subsidiaries in terms of the way the Bill is currently written for buying from X limited rather than directly from the supplier themselves. If I may move on to amendment 34 in my name and that of my honourable friend the Member for Ogmore. This goes to the heart of some of the main issues that have been discussed in this House over the last few months. Our amendments call on the Government to ensure that the groceries supply code of practice on which the adjudicator referees covers the issue of commercial pressures that could put on supplier which is drive down quality and safety, leading to further scandals in beef products. This allows the adjudicator to include in its annual report any instance where they've become aware that commercial pressures have been applied to suppliers to drive down  health and safety, which has driven down standards in authenticity. This amendment is directly related to clause 14 and the annual report to the Office of Fair Trading and not necessarily in sense of the issues around someone taking a case to the adjudicator to  in terms of the code. Amendment 35 is just an amendment that requires the adjudicator to send its annual report to the Food Standards Agency. This creates a link-up between the adjudicator and the FSA in terms of the issues around the horsemeat scandal we've seen in recent weeks. The UKest National Beef Association has blamed what it called bullying culture UK buy verse used for the presence of horsemeat in beef  They said the public and retairls were paying the price for short-sighted and price-led tactics and that buyers had secured as much as possible for as little as  This has added so much unnecessary cost that short cuts on quality and traceability and even sheeting by some suppliers -- cheating by some suppliers is inevitable. Consumers must have dfd that the food they buy is correctly labelled -- have confidence that the food they buy is correctly labelled and  Ministers in terms of the debates we've had in this House have been slow to act. The Irish FSA has been ahead of the UK in every step on this. I think by having an annual reporting requirement in terms of food safety, hygiene and reporting through the adjudicator, some of the issues raised eloquently by the National Beef Association could be dealt  That also gives another linkage to the Food Standards  because it is true Mr Deputy Speaker that the budget for the Food Standards Agency has been cut from £143 million to £132  Whilst I don't think we should get into a debate today about budgets of particular Government agencies or departments, which would be an important step to say that the adjudicator in its report to the OFT could refer some of its cases that.

That would allow a splir to take that issue to the adjudicator that. May be included in the adjudicator's annual report if this amendment was  It may help to stop that going to the stages that we've seen in the last few weeks. So the amendment today, Mr Deputy Speaker, could play a very important part in tackling future abuses that could  I think that goes to what the Minister just said in terms of his intervention. I wonder any could push the nor reply on whether she agrees that's crucial that the adjudicator is alert to these issues and whether she will report the amendment if any abuses they say occur in terms of food hygiene and food safety issues and report these directly into the OFT. The memp Ogmore may want toexpant on these issues as we go forward. If I may move to amendment 3, moved by my honourable friend for Hayes and Harlington. This would require the Office of Fair Trading to explicitly respond to the recommendations that the adjudicator publishes. If we see what happens if the joir was to put in a food hygiene or safety issue into its annual report -- if the adjudicator was to put in a food hygiene or safety issue into its annual report. In terms of the way the adjudicator will be set up. As the Bill currently stands, the adjudicator can make recommendations to the Office of Fair Trading should it determine that changes could should be made to the groceries code  It is only the Office of Fair Trading that can change the  There is nothing in the Bill that binds the OFT. We are not saying there should be a bibding clause in this Bill to ensure the OFT acts but there The Minister responded by saying if the OFT continued to ignore recommendations, the Government would be looking to step in and do something about the OFT. Indeed there could be something of a review of the OFT's processes. That's good and well and aappreciate the Minister gave that  We are looking for a two-way dialogue between the adjudicator's office and the OFT. We'll certainly be supporting this  if my honourable friend wishes to press this to a gifplgts If I may come briefly -- to a  If I may come briefly to the issues raised by the Member for  In terms of the free market issue, sometimes you need regulation to allow the free market to work properly. Indeed the whole purpose of the groceries code and the code adjudicator is to ensure that those markets work properly without having a very much damaging the imbalance between the power of various factors in that. The large companies that were listed by the Member for Shipley can very much look after themselves. He's right to raise that issue. They indleed not go to the adjudicator. The adjudicator themselves have been set up to look specifically as the Competition Commission looked at supplier imbalances in terms of market power, so I'm sure the adjudicator will not wish to look at an imbalance that's the other  because she isn't mandated to  The in terms of the sunset  in terms of royal  if Member for Shipley says the adjudicator will have nothing to do and on the one hand says the adjudicator will be looking after the interests of these large organisations. If the adjudicator has lots to do, we won't wish to have a "sunset clause" after seven years and therefore the adjudicator will  It is an unnecessary  We've got to give the adjudicator our confidence that she will do a good job in those circumstances. I don't think I have to deal directly with the Member for Christchurch, given that the territoriality of amendment 30, whether or not the ActionAid and trade issues can be dealt. That's quite important. Die have sympathy for amendment 27 that the Member for Christchurch will be putting  One of the parts in committee was that we didn't have the opportunity for the adjudicator to come in after day one after royal assent. To look at issues that are happening now, but indeed perhaps collect evidence from issues that have happened since the code came into action. That was a sensible amendment to put forward. The quicker the adjudicator gets up and running and into practice we'll have lots of issues to deal with or if the Member for Shipley is  we'll have none. Mr Deputy  I move the amendments  I would potential wish to test the view of the House on amendment 34, which is attached to amendment 35 and we would like to support the Member for Hayes and To a certain extent I rise with an enormous amount of frustration. A number of members, in my opinion, don't wholly seem to understand what the role of the gross gres will be and how they fit into the - - gross gres will be and how they fit into the supply chain. There has been debate around new clause 2 and 3 which I would like to explore. I understand his motivation to try and make sure that this Groceries Code Adjudicator is dealing with smaller companies. But I think he misunderstands how the grocery supply chain works. It is a simple fact that I do agree with him when he say that is very large companies are big enough, ugly and strong enough to do their own negotiation. That is what will happen between those suppliers and those supermarkets. And the Groceries Code Adjudicator has no role whatsoever in those deals or in those supply contracts. Even a very small producer could agree, if they chose to do so, to supply a product at below the cost of production. If they were minded to do that, that would be entirely to their decision to do that and they could commit suicide in that way and there would be no role for the Groceries Code Adjudicator to step in and be involved in that deal at all. The only point at which the adjudicator would get involved, is when the supermarket wants to change that  which has been agreed by the supplier and the retailer. And it seems fairly simple to me: if you are a Unilever are a very large corporation, you have the commercial power, the commercial  if you like, to negotiate a deal on which you are happy and the retailer is happy. Where both parties are content. As long as that deal doesn't change, no-one will get involved. That seems to me to be a system which will work credibly well and has worked well in terms of market forces, for generations in the past and generations to come. So, I think the point he makes about trying to restrict this to very small turnover companies, whilst it's honourable, it, frankly, not  Because, there won't be a case which comes forward. I happily give way. My amendment doesn't seek to restrict this to very small supplier. It is suppliers up to £1 billion. Surely he can't argue that a supplier with a turnover of £950 million is a very small supplier. I'm grateful for the swir It allows me it Ify that's exactly the point I'm making. At in point will that come forward. At no point will there be a negotiation. It is this is not a David and go eye @ situation, -- Goliath. There are two Goliaths. The honourable member has made a career at criticising unnecessary  It seems strange he is introduce something which is not  I hope he can ve rerecognises it'll not be necessary to introduce this clause because there will not be a role to negotiate between two Goliaths. I thank my honourable friend. Surely this will send a crystal clear message to the adjudicator when they take on the role where, they need to focus their efforts? Again, there is a misunderstanding as to what will happen. We are talking about very large companies, or he is talking about very large  or who are negotiating with very large companies. They both have an equal amount of commercial muscle. So there will not be one party able to bully the  I think that is the quite  What we are talking  with the adjudicator, is to get involved, as a referee, to negotiate where one very large  frankly abuses a smaller  and uses their commercial  if you like, to push that  I entirely support the arguments my honourable friend is  Of course, he knows this is a very dynamic and indeed creative  And one in which indeed  over time, been created a number of intermediaries and subsidiaries which would have,  a turnover of over £1 billion and in fact could be used as a means of side-stepping if this amendment came. Which I do  I pay tribute to the honourable member for St Ives who has worked on this, for before I was a member of this House and in such I recognise the contribution  I think maybe that's something that the adjudicator could look at, as we move forward. And there then is this ability, if  to put a film between parties and cause an issue. But, of  that then comes back to very small suppliers who are  if you like, that middle  I just wanted to turn, briefly, to new clause 3, which calls for the Bill to expire after seven  which again would be very disappointing. If I can use it's analogy of a football match, where if we get to half-time and the referee has not had necessity to issue a yellow card. At no point would anybody suggest we didn't need a referee in the second half because they've not had to take any action in the first half. I will  Does he agree with me that we've had plenty of time to understand how supermarkets are dealing with suppliers and it is because of that that everyone who has looked closely at this issue has concluded that we do indeed need a adjudicator. I'm happy to agree the honourable gentleman and again pay tribute to the work that he has done in bringing this legislation forward to this point. Will my honourable friend agree, regardless of whether there were complaints or not, there will still, nevertheless, be a cost to the whole adjudicator's office, existing and, therefore, it would make sense to bring the whole thing  if it is not proving to be worthwhile for the consumer? I think that's an interesting argument that the honourable gentleman puts forward and, clearly, you could make the same argument across the whole of Government.  if crime starts to fall in  do you then withdraw the police because it is not necessary to have the police within that area. You've got to have a referee to make sure that the rules are being obeyed and the Groceries Code Adjudicator will be a great referee and will have the teeth to make sure that the Goliath does not bully the Damian and that's something which this Government should be very proud of and should bring parity and common sense to  I'm pleased to speak in this debate and welcome the contributions. I'm surprised it has been as sparky as it has been. I didn't expect that. I welcome it. It allows us to flesh out not only discussions on the amendments on the new clause bus also the fundamental principles of what we are trying to achieve. -- new clauses but also. In respects of new clause 1 and 3, I wasn't going to speak to them but in reiterating the very good comments from the honourable member for Sherwood and South South East Cambridge and others, I would say that a great deal of the discussion at the committee staged focused on the fact that the adjudicator's office will be deliberately, intentionally, small and mean and  It will not be some behemoth, as honourable members that introduced clauses 1, 2 and 3 suggest it would be. It is supposed to be an intelligent organisation that does not go on fishing expeditions but that responds to good intelligence, to follow that. I suspect if there are no cases to  then the report would be very slim indeed and they certainly will not be responding to Proctor and Gamble or anybody else on the case - please look at the power relationship within the supply chain and how we are being disgracefully abused. I have to say to the honourable gentleman who moved at great length, new clauses  2 and 3 news clause 3 which gives the reality to what the mission is - which is that at a set moment in time to get rid of the  Fly in the face on the advice that has come down, over  from the Competition Commission and others, that there is a need for this jury to be there. Lean and mean, yes, but have some faith in the adjudicator, I would say to the hoven rabble gentleman for Shipley that having given them the power -- the honourable gentleman. Having given them the position and advertise the post, allow them to decide where the investigations follow and pursue on it on behalf  efficient supply chain. He seemed to be implying he was criticising me for moving my great clause at new length. Would he accept it was moved at great length because of the sheer volumes of interventions from people, not least for himself. I'm in no way being critical of speaking at great  I'm in no way critical of the length of time. I'm glad he has had the opportunity to expand. Let me make one other point. I am I have no doubt that he and colleagues who spoke in support of the amendments believe firmly in what he was saying and believe firmly that you should have more of what he regards, interestingly, as a free market. I'm not an anti-free  I have to say. I say to the honourable gentleman, he may not realise it, but I spent six years working in the private sector, running private sector leisure centres and theatres. I understand how it works. I have worked within it as a manager and businessperson  I'm opposed to the approach that says we can better your neighbour or have a race to the  When the honourable gentleman puts out the challenge to the honourable members - explain to your constituents why you would argue against the cheapest possible  I will tell him: I will not argue on behalf of my constituents that I will have the cheapest possible price for every product on a superMcet shelf, if that means fakry fiezing employment protection, if that means Saakashviliry fiezing the gang Leaders Union. And if that means the regulations in agriculture in terms of animal we will faifrplt his argument that we should providing very cheapest, is the argument that is previously exposed to the detriment, large multinational companies, when they have been caught out for exploitation for low standards. We only need to think back in a wholly different sector some years ago to Nike and the previous World Cup when the great merchandise they were producing, the very football pitches on the field, were being produced in developing nations in sweat shop conditions. Was that to the benefit? Before I give way, let me ill trait with one other example, I want it speak to our amendments 34 and 35 -- to speak. In the name of the honourable member for Edinburgh South and myself. Another illustration if the House wants to see one more recently is the issue of food provenance and food safety. I do not believe that anybody in this House can argue seriously that the commercial pressures, across a very complex supply chain, have had no bearing whatsoever on the entry of significant levels of adulterated meat into this food  That is where a pure free market ideology will take us and that'sy stand out firmly against the spir nit which those amendments  -- the spirit in which. TheThe honourable member is making excellent points. I want to support them by gently reminding him that new clause 2 will prevent the adjudicator supporting the very multinational companies he is seeking to name and shame. I thank the honourable member. That has intrigued me. Let's say, for  a larger operator within  over the turnover, actually steps forward to the adjudicator with evidence that shows the case this is not affecting them directly but is affecting right down the chain a series of smaller suppliers - is the honourable gentleman seriously suggesting that the adjudicator cannot take action on that? I want the adjudicator and I trust the adjudicator to follow the evidence where there is market abuse taking place and where the power relationship within that supply chain is being abused. If that comes from a larger operator, all the well to the good. I want the adjudicator to step in and take right action. I will give way. Could I thank my honourable friend for giving way. Would he agree with me that there is a need to protect all within the food supply chain and representing a constituency in Northern Ireland I'm very conscious of the dysfunctionality in that food supply chain in relation to food prices, but also, now, in relation to the issue of food provenance and food labelling? The honourable lady is absolutely right and speaks to the spirit and letter of the amendment which I will now turn my attention to. And if I can turn to amendments 34 and  and just to add some substance to why I think these are critical amendments today, because of what has passed before our eyes in the time since this Bill actually left  As honourable members  last week, one of the biggest catering firms within the UK and within Europe, a firm that actually supplies processed meat to  to hospitals, to our Armed  withdrew all, all of its frozen beef products after discovering adulteration with  And just in case people say - in that argument that says on the race to the bottom put on the supermarket shelves the cheapest,  the cheapest, this is where we head.

The Food Standards Agency on Friday released their second tranche of  The first tranche was a week before. The first tranche was revealing enough. The second tranche of results submitted by the food industry revealed that one in 80 beef products were found to contain horsemeat. One in 80. I will repeat that - one in 80. As we  we've also had the issues and all of this is related to the argument around amendments 34 and  because the honourable gentleman's busily discussing among themselves like an Open University  they are conferring. The amendments are related to the commercial pressures, as my honourable friend Edinburgh South  on the supply chain. We also have had since the committee last met the revelation around Ikea. Many people have passed by their catering facilities on the way through their shopping experience and stopped to sample their  But not for the moment, those meatballs have been withdrawn  The shadow Secretary of State for Defra remarked knowing, as we now know, that some catering companies have been withdrawing products on the quiet. That is the  That rather than being open as the big supermarkets have been and go out and test, they have been withdrawing products which they may suspect have had adulteration of meat before they can be tested. As the shadow Secretary of State said, it is totally wrong for companies to recall suspect meat products on the quiet without telling the FSA. Let me turn to a final illustration as to why this amendment is so  It relates to the production of evident by LGC. LGC is the UK's designated national measurement institute for chemical and biochemical analysis. It's the national reference laboratory and the host organisation for the UK Government's chemist function Short, they know what they are talking  They've produced their findings on the US of phenylbutazone. I will not pull from it selectively Mr Deputy  I will be fair and traed full five first points, because it is critical to give the overall  They say in terms of phenylbutazone, the levels of phenylbutazone if present in horsemeat is thousands of times lower than any that cause adverse effect in humans. Secondly, the risk it's small and rare. Estimated to affect perhaps one in 30,000. My quick calculation, Mr Deputy  based on the UK is one in 000 is around about 2,000 people. Within the UK.

I will give way to the Defra Minister. I am most grateful to the honourable  because it is very important that people understand what that advice and what the data actually suggests. He's been set out clearly by the chief medical  I don't want anyone to go away from this debate believing,  one in 20,000 people are subject to serious medical consequences of consuming phenylbutazone?

I hope he understands it and wouldn't want to misrepresent it.

The Minister said whether it is one in  It is roughly one in 2,000. I repeat the advice that these are given to Government, which is that there's a possibility... THE SPEAKER: Order! Don't test may patience any more. I think we can both agree that you are desperate to speak to the amendment and now we are going back on the amendment. We don't want to bring in somebody else just yet do we? I'm happy having put the quite extensively and I would love to give way to the honourable gentleman opposite as long as it is not going to draw me into contravene Mr Deputy Speaker's  How on earth he thinks I would want to draw him into confrontation with you I don't know. I want to challenge him on the fundamental aspect of this group of amendments An earlier intervention on my honourable friend the Member for Shipley he made the point that this whole Bill is about enforcement of the grocery code of  Does he really, and I understand him wanting to raise the horsemeat scandal whenever he possibly can, but does he really believe these amendments, particularly 34, and expects the adjudicator to report on issues to do with food safety, food hygiene and authenticity is within the code of practice? What he's doing is proposing to dramatically extend the power of the adjudicator and the role of this legislation way beyond anything the Competition Commission ever envisaged. I thank the honourable gentleman for not tempting me to infringe the guidance by the Deputy Speaker. We had a great debate in committee on the adjudicator to comment on a number of things. In fact from both sides of the benches there were several contributions that said  if they were aware of abuses  then of course we would expect the adjudicator to inform whoever of the relevant abuses, whatever that might be. So I think the amendment that we have done, it will be interested in the Government's response on this. But I would have thought there was almost an obligation on the adjudicator should they say any evidence of this sort of abuse in terms of the management of the supply chain to report it. That's what this amendment seeks to do. We look at what the Government says but I agree with my honourable friend the Member for Edinburgh South in saying this is very  amendment 34 and 35, and we look to see what the Minister says in response. We were quite convinced that this is something that the adjudicator should have one eye to as well as his core role on the supply chain. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker, I tries support new  In so doing say that I think that the essence of this Bill and this legislation in most people's eyes was that it was designed to protect the UK supplier, particularly of fresh produce. As my right honourable friend the Member for south-west Cambridgeshire has said. What the honourable gentleman opposite has just delivered is a scaremongering speech designed to undermine British splives fresh meat and  I think that's very  Can I say, Mr Deputy  that last night I was at a speech given by the Minister of State at the (Inaudible). The speech was titled Deregulation for  I was slightly confused by what I've heard so far in this  It seems that this is  I asked the Minister when she responds how is this going to be winter with the Government's growth agenda? The Minister last night was saying that there's two for one principle. That for every £1 of additional burden placed through regulation, £2 have to be  That brings me on to new clauses 4 and 5. These are designed to put focus on the fact that this Bill as currently drafted is going to have the law of unintended consequences writ large. It is going to benefit potentially suppliers from not only elsewhere in Europe but also right across the  when most people who support this Bill think that they are doing so in order to help the farmer down the road in the United Kingdom. That's far from the case. What's going to happen is that the Bill is going to ten able suppliers from overseas to be able to exploit our system at a time when our own suppliers and producers are not able to access overseas markets on an equivalent basis. I'm sure my honourable friend is going to explain new clause 4 in more detail, but I'm troubled by the way it is drafted at the moment when it says if the principal headquarters are outside the European Union. Why is it not outside the United Kingdom? My honourable friend anticipates the argument I'm going to put, which is that I was in discussion about whether an amendment referring only the outside the United Kingdom would be in order and selectable. The advice that I  and obviously Mr Deputy Speaker I am responsible for whether to act or not on advice, but on advice I decided that it would be much more like lib that my new clause would be selected if need sned of referring to the United Kingdom I referred to the European Union. That is because of single market and European Union  Obviously I wanted to ensure as far as possible that my new clause would be selectable. But my honourable friend makes a good  because he is saying the whole purpose, the public debate, is about why can't we buy British? Why can't we buy UK food and thereby avoid the risk... THE SPEAKER: I can remind PPSs. Order! Unfortunately, the member speaking, every time you walk past, it is constantly coming into the eye of  We all want to hear Mr  Mr Deputy Speaker, the only comfort that I take is that obviously my remarks are created such confusion on the front bench that they were needing to get an enormous number of messages sent to them by the box, so I take some consolation from that. It's the incumbent upon the Minister in responding to this debate to explain how this particular Bill is going to help UK producers while at the same time not giving benefits and privileges to produce from the rest of the European Union, let alone outside the European Union. I would like to give the maximum amount of time to the Minister to respond to this debate, so I would like to say in relation to amendment 27, amendment 27, which seemed to be warmly endorsed by the opposition front bench. I can't understand why they didn't table such an amendment themselves. Thisna would say this Bill should Ben acted two months after royal  Then it would be clear on the face of the Bill when it was going be brought in. Fit was such fantastic legislation, why not bring it in in the normal way, the whole Bill two months after royal assent? I hope that the Minister will deal with those points in response and also particularly to the very powerful argument put forward by my honourable friend for Shipley in regulation to new clause  I cannot relat to the supermarket industry but I can to the travel  And there are a number of big suppliers who put pressure on smaller suppliers. And in my day, I was one of those smaller suppliers. But I didn't come across the descriptions that are happening in the supermarkets, where there has been really nasty attempts to use hauliers that have been demanded by the supermarket. Those sort of things I didn't come across. I accept that this is a very different case. Where I think the whole House is supportive, is on the small producers, who are unfairly penalised by the actions  very large supermarkets. But where I think the House should not be united is give their support to companies that may even be on the greater side of the supermarket and I'm very attracted and minded to support new clause 2 unless the minister and a very fine minister  too, can persuade this House that thrst there is some really fundamental reason not -- that there is some really fundamental reason not to select it.  of course that the minister is going to stand up and having listened to, I think arguments from all over the House, that really the Government should accept new clause 2. It is the sort of thing that I would like to see happen in Parliament more often. When reasoned cases are made, which don't affect in anyway the direction of what the Government  in fact I think it enhances what the Government wants, because if big companies are excluded from being able to cues the adjudicator, that will allow the adjudicator more time to reach decisions on the small suppliers that matter. That is why I intervened on my friend because I wanted to see why there was reason why we shouldn't do it. I don't think there is a reason why new clause 2 shouldn't be accepted. Why not go ahead and accept it? I do hope that the minister will do  but if she doesn't, I am certainly minded to support new clause in a division. Minister?? Thank you very much, indeed Mr Deputy speaker, I would like it thank the honourable members 24 that have contributed to thedy bait on this series of amendments and tabling amendments which we have been able to discuss. I thought it might be helpful to briefly recap on why we are here. It actually relates to the reasons why I may have to disappoint honourable members and not be able to accept their amendments, and that is the purpose of the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill, how we have come position of having this Bill in front of us. That really relates it the Competition Commission report and what they found was that while the market was functions effectively in delivering low grocery prices to consumers, some practices by large retailers could have an anti-competitive  They found that due to the  the large retailers were engaging in practice that is Trevored excessive risk and unexpected costs to their suppliers and that in turn this could reduce the incentive of suppliers to invest and innovate which would act against the long-term interests of  It's worth noting that all six members of the competition group who undertook the market investigation into groceries agreed that the transfer of excessive risks are unexpected costs by grocery retailers or their suppliers is likely to lesson suppliers' incentives to invest in new capacity, products or production processes frbg unchecked they would have a debtry trepbl affect consumers -- if unchecked they could have a detrimental affect. They said all but one member of the panel considered the enforcement of  The code on its own would not be enough. That goes to the points my honourable friend for Shipley raised earlier. The Competition Commission report is absolutely kee. They created the groceries supply order and the code is deriefd from that and that is what needs to be enforced by  -- derived. That's why the Government will be resisting the amendment that is encourage the code and adjudicator to deviate from that report. So, I think it is worth mentioning that, of course, this adjudicator was in all three major party's manifestos and endorsed by the BIS Select Committee in prelegislative committee and important that following discussions at second read n and committee stage, and very much representations encouraging the pre-appointment outany to be able to be undertaken by the BIS Select Committee and I'm delighted that the Government has been able to a,dit that request. I think that -- accommodate that QI think that scrutiny is welcome and leads to bitter legislation and improves the strength of Parliament. Is what the minister saying is she is incapable of making her own decision and exercising her ownment  that she believes her role is to rubber stamp what the competition and Select Committee says and leave all of the critical faculties at home? No, but I do think it is very important to listen to Parliament as I have just  I think that was the point that certainly some of his colleagues were making earlier. A code without an adjudicator is to borrow an analogy from my honourable friend like a sports match with a rule book but no  The climate of fear has been described by the member for Augmore w which can mean that splirs are unwilling to come forward which is why -- suppliers are unkling to come forward which is why the adjudicator is necessary. Turning to specific amendments, new  4 and 5 that were tabled, these would all restrict the operation of the adjudicator to be less extensive than the coverage provided by the code. Either by excluding suppliers above a be certain turnover or excluding suppliers or supplies from outside  I don't think in pren it is actually a sensible approach to  -- in principle. The groceries code was put in place by the Competition Commission after a detailed and thorough investigation to rectify certain features that were causing long-term detriment of the consumers. The prime purpose of the adjudicator is to enforce the code so it is sensible and coherent that the adjudicator and code have the same coverage. Regarding the particular suggestion in new clause 2 of excluding suppliers with large  I think it is important to point out that the Competition Commission and the BIS Select Committee explicitly considered this and concluded that excluding certain suppliers would not be appropriate to. Quote from the committee's report, "This approach would be impractical." They stated that it applies to suppliers of all sizes and so should enforcement. And as it is the gateway to the dispute resolution procedure, large suppliers would only have the courts then for address and not the arbitration process which is also very helpful and indeed, if that evidence from large suppliers, on whether retailers are complying, cannot be taken into account, then smaller supplies and this point was made earlier, by other honourable  might lose out because that might be crucial to the case. Large suppliers also, according to the committee, may be better able to bring ways to spread potential breaches to the adjudicator's attention than small suppliers. For all of those reasons, it is important that the extent of the adjudicator fits with the code.We did have a lot of discussions about whether we should restrict who should complain. In committee, and other discussions through pre- legislative scrutiny. Thee centred around whether or not trade associations should be allowed to  We have basically decided to allow evidence from any source  I think, therefore, that ruling out evidence from particular sources will actually weaken the adjudicator and indeed I suspect that might actually be the intention of the amendment, given that it is tabled by people who have the motivation that they don't actually want the adjudicator to be in place at all. I think the minister is right. I'm in the coming from that position. Does she not fear that there is a  if you allow large suppliers to go to the adjudicator, it'll clog the system up and not do what it is supposed to do, which is look after the small suppliers? I don't believe that is the case. The adjudicator will obviously be able to make their own assessments, and inone of the things they will be doing is recommending what is required in terms of reto dole with the complaints coming forward. If there are and I hope there will be very few complaints and the industry is confident there will be few complaints. I absolutely whole heartedly hope that is the case but  for example, we find that there are many breaches of the code, and that that evidence comes from a variety of sources, then the adjudicator will need to look at that and be empowered to make recommendations and requests that they need to be properly and adequately resourced in order to address that. So, I think an arbitrary restriction on who can complain actually makes the adjudicator's life harder and could increase the risk of judicial  So we will be rejecting that amendment and encourage honourable members to oppose that if it is pressed to division. In the honourable member for Shipley's  he seemed to suggest that this would cost consumers more  But, the evidence that has been presented from all of the supermarkets, who have given evidence on this matter, when asked, they said - supplying with the code had caused them to raise prices. I think his concerns on this particular point are misplaced. This will not be costing consumers and indeed surveys showed that 84% of consumers actually sport adjudicator and I'm sure honourable members from their mail bags will be aware that there is a great deal of public support for the  I give way. I'm very  The minister is making the compelling case for the Bill which we support. I wonder if she would reflect on evidence we got that showed the grocery's code and well-appointed adjudicator will help and will have the opportunity to lower prices for the consumer. He makes an important point much the Competition Commission were very clear that innovation had been stifleed or could be stifleed by the potential anti-competitive price in this sector, so it follow from that that innovation is being encouraged by making sure there is no anti-competitive prices going on, that will make sure that consumers can ultimately get a better deal and it is in their interests. There were also a few red herings put forward around whether Esso and tobacco companies would be protected in some way by this, but I would just refer honourable members that was pointed out by the honourable member from south-east Cambridgeshire that it is very  groceries remains food, other than that sold for consumption. Pet food, drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic other than that sold for consumption. But  petrol bs clothing, DIY products finance, iss, newspapers,  greeting cards, CDs, DVDs,  plants, equipment, books,  perfumes, cosmetics, kitchen hardware, gardening  tobacco, and tobacco  And that is what the groceries supply order states and that was found to be relevant through the Competition Commission investigation. So I think it is important to have on the record that some of those red herings earlier were just that. I will just come to one of the points that the hon member for Augmore raised.That the honourable member raised. That the cost was raised and honourable gentleman pointed out it would nobt  It is estimated to be 000 a year. A question was asked what was the adjudicator  They are currently on a one-day a week basis as a adjudicator designate at £23,000 aier and indeed going up to three days a woke on that same right once the royal aisn't and indeed the commencement comes into force. As we very much hope that it will. Specifically on new clauses 4 and 5, I think it is fundamentally right that large supermarkets should treat their suppliers fairly, wherever they are lo located. The issue about decreased inowe vaegs in the supply chain that the Competition Commission shall -- innovation in the spli chain that  that is the case regardless of whether the suppliers are outside the EU or UK. Excluding overseas suppliers with nobt helpful to the fundamental purpose and indeed understand it. -- would not be helpful. The code and the adjudicator compliment each other so need to have the same scope. So I resisted in committee amendments that would have expanded the role of the adjudicator beyond just enforcing the code but I also here must resist amindments that limit the adjudicator's scope to be narrower than the code. I hope my honourable friends will withdraw the amendments but if they don't I will advise colleagues to vote I suffer to a severe allergy to nuts and rely on food labelling to stop me from having a life- threateningen flak tick reaction. This is why it is so serious. It is being taken seriously and why our ministerial colleagues in Defra have taken action with food  and on tracking down those people who've caused this and bringing them to justice. The Food Standards Agency visions have already led to arrest and Ministers and the FSA are working with scientists the, Inspectors and food businesses in Britain and across Europe to ensure this doesn't happen again. While those recent incidents have been appalling, they are not a matter for the adjudicator. Expanding the adjudicator's role to look at these issues would not be helpful. It would lead to counterproductive  It is not where text pert ease of the adjudicator will be developed. We have the Food Standards Agency for that and so it is also not in terms of the competition issues what it is being  The clearly, what the adjudicator does in promoting productivity and investment in the food chain of the supply chain, that might help the environment to create an environment where these types of scandals are less likely  I think that's the extent of the adjudicator's role in the current horsemeat scandal. It is very different from them enforcing these issues. On the issue of reporting we had requests to be included in the report, whether it was available resources, recommendations to the OFT, the monitoring compliance. We even had the suggestion that they should report on cartel activity. If they came across any criminal activity they would be expected to report that to the police. We want to make sure that reports can be sensible documents rather than a tick box excerpt size with a list as long as your arm of what to include. I would ask members to withdraw those amendments. Amendments 30 and 31 from the same members are of a different nature. They prescribe what should be considered in clause 13, 2010 adjudicator will be assessing if they think changes to the code should be recommended to the Office of Fair Trading. One of the issues raised in this discussion was about a concern around Asda and a foreign subsidiary sup is. Tinge name was  I want to provide an ash troons the House that large retailers are required by the order as it stands to procure in a way that all of their subsidiaries comply with the order as if they themselves were bound by it. That includes incorporating the code into those supply agreements. If that didn't happen, that would the constitute a breach of the order by the large retail Cher is named in the order that. Gives protection that can provide some reassurance. We discovered at length the territorial extent of the code in committee. I hope I gave substantial assurance there is. We also discussed with whether the code should Becks tended to intermediaries. I don't want to revisit those arguments. The fundamental question here is is it appropriate if single out individual issues the adjudicator should focus on. If members look at  it is widely drafted and  It means that the adjudicator - if they consider it  they must recommend them to the Office of Fair Trading. To single out specific issues, I  weakens that clause rather than strengthening it. Single out intermediaries would be particularly unappropriate, as it is unlikely the code could be amended to include intermediaries without the Competition Commission. The legal framework is set down in the Enterprise Act 2002. This states that for that to happen there must be a change in circumstances. For example a new bives practice by retairls, and that change must relate to the initial adverse effects found by the Competition Commission. So the passing of excessive risk and unexpected cost to supplies. It is unlikely those conditions would be met with respect to intermediaries. It could Becks tended to uncover another abusive practice similar in nature and effects to those prescribed in the code, but which wasn't in the market when the commission did their initial investigation. This group also has another set of amendments about the operation Andrew of the adjudicator. I will turn to amendment 3 to require that the Office of Fair Trading to respond to recommendations. I don't believe this is necessary. I appreciate that he has looked at what was said in committee, where we had this discussion in detail. The OFT has a duty which includes a duty to respond to members of the public and other authorities where  It is about creating a system not overly predictive. I will give way to the honourable  I'm grateful. Does that mean she can now place on the record the Government would expect the OFT to respond in a public, open and transparent and timely manner to any request or recommendation from the adjudicator? I will give that assurance in the same way that any information that's related to the body such as the OFT is brought  Particularly by a respected public servant, we would expect that to be responded to appropriately as part of that  I don't think we want to be overly predictive in the legislation. Ip hope that reassurance is helpful to the honourable gentleman. I urge him to withdraw his amendment. Amendment 28 requires the adjudicator to set out in guide chance laws will apply to arbitration. I would argue that that would duplicate information already in the groceries supply  We had discussion on arbitration at committee understand the other place when they considered this legislation. I would refer honourable members to section 11 of the groceries supply order which sets tout rules that will apply and the seat of the arbitration will be in London or such city that the supply may  We don't believe it is necessary to make it a requirement on the face of the Bill. Mr Deputy  is my honourable friend at all contrite about the fact that we were not going to reach the second and third group of snements No, I'm  I think we have had an interesting debate this afternoon. I suspect we could perhaps have had it with a degree of greater  but nonetheless we are  The honourable Member for Christchurch, amendment 27, I'm happy to make a commitment that the Government intends to commence the Bill two months after royal assent. It is usual procedure not to set this out in legislation but to allow the Secretary of State discretion to commence it by order. Finally I deal with new clause 3 by the Member for Shipley, which is one I can't accept either in fact  I agree we absolutely do not want statutory offices continue wrg they were not needed. This is a prince nal the Government has been  on the base of, and what we've done in accordance with our general policy on sunseting is every three years the Secretary of State must review the adjudicator  if appropriate, must bol tissue office. If in seven years' time problems that led to the creation of this Bill and the adjudicator persist, we wouldn't want the Bill to be automatically  While we will absolutely be able to reassure members, the Secretary of State will be rigorous in reviewing this issue. I have to say I think that this is a much better answer to making sure we don't have statutory office continuing unnecessarily. I hope that honourable members will be satisfied with my assurances and withdraw their amendments. If that is not the case, I urge members to reject the amendments before us. THE SPEAKER: Continuing clause 1. Mr Dave ies. I'm grateful to my honourable friend who is supported my amendment. I'm grateful to my honourable friend the Member for welling borough. He decided that we were going to be in a ludicrous situation if my new clause 2 wasn't accepted today, whereby retailers would turnover of £1 billion would be subject to the code but will be able to be taken to an adjudicator by supplies, with a turnover of over £1 billion themselves. Even though they are perfectly big enough and capable enough of looking after their own interests and taking any disputes to court if they so we should. Unfortunately it wasn't my honourable friend, while he dime the debate with an open  that certainly wasn't the case I'm afraid to say with the  who made it clear perhaps this is the reason why we've only had three hours for this set of amendments in total, that she had already decided what the Government's view was. It was a completely pointless excerpt size having the report stage of the Bill. She made it clear she wasn't prepare toad listen to the debate, because the Competition Commissioner told her watt to say and they wasn't prepared to Deviate from that. We can't allow it to stand that we are going to be in the state of sect occupy an adjudicator which multinational companies with turn jomp of over £1 billion be able to go to to take complaints against retailers of over, with turn jomp of over £1 billion as well.

We have proposed additional safeguards which gives powers to the Secretary of State to restrict the information on which the adjudicator can move forward. We now have a Bill which I think of this House can be proud of. We as Government have listened to their concerns of members are rented the House to create most effective adjudicator possible. We believe we have achieved that goal. At press release from the groceries market action grip said that fair trade campaigners say that supermarket watchdog has at Teesport. And be my honourable friend wanted a watchdog with teeth and even brought them visual AIDS to support that contention at second reading. -- the visual support. It will be better for our producers, consumers and retailers as well, I believe it. I beg to move on.The Bill will be read for the third time. A lot of people want to get in and we have to finish by 4:45pm. No pressure. I will be very quick. Let me return there thanks first of all to the front bench team. I recall at second reading on this occasion it be stamped the authority that we would not have fines on the bill, and now we have fines. They said they would not send the adjudicator took their select committee because it was a dereliction of parliamentary duty, it was not important enough to have up your  so I am delighted they came to our way of thinking. I am also delighted that they have pet trade associations onto the face of the bill it as well. Despite the French bench ministers taking very close analysis -- the front bench ministers are taking a close analysis we have come very far. As is traditional at the end of committees you were supposed to thank all the officers and the chair and everyone involved. I forgot to thank one person. This man has done more in his eyes than many in getting us to where we are  I would like to right that wrong by giving thanks to him and everything he has done. Has wonderful speech earlier, as well. And the Member for St Ives. I have tried to thank this number twice, just prior to me thanking him he has propped up and thrown a warbler  I am delighted that I can banking today. And of course the member who brought the private member's bill to the House, it should be a proud moment for him. The last two thanks is to everyone who was on the committee. It was a lively debate. I am also disappointed that one member has not taken the opportunity to be in the chamber today. The Member for East Dumbarton Show had only been on her feet for about 20 seconds at committee when another member popped up and said they should call it off the trolley. I do not let it pass without saying that I wish she was here to do that. We have used a lot of the terminology around this being at toothless tiger. I think it now has teeth. There are some issues we would have liked to see on the side at a house, unfortunately that has not come to  We were told that the ministers will be amenable to change in we the adjudicator processes things in the future. I think it is there a member for East Bedfordshire, Sherwood, sorry. Be used examples in the daily committee of farmers disputes. That would not have been covered with the adjudicator in place, the example of dairy farmers is very important in terms of keeping the code lives and keeping it responsive to the industry. The Member for Shipley it also raised some important points. The supermarkets are such a considerable contribution to the  the court has to be responsive to their needs as well. We sent three Tests for this Bill when we started. I think we have met all those tests. We're disappointed around the supply- chain issues, but again I would hope that ministers all reflect on  A deeper commitment at second reading and committee to work constructively with the  I think we have done  I think we have a better Bill. Everyone involved in this process for longer than I have been, it should be very proud. We will have a better supply chain and a far better market. I will just take 60  I would like to add my congratulations to the front bench for bringing the legislation for a word and also paid tribute to the member furnace Morgan. Before I was a member I had pushed this through at Private Member's Bill. It took a change in Government for the Bill to receive Government support. That is something the Coalition should be very proud of. They have prop forward legislation which levels the playing field. I think everyone in this House can support fair play. I think it is worth noticing that this is not about an adjudicator poking their noses in to a private deal for a relationship between a supplier and a retailer, it is about making sure that when the deal is done the ball all stick to the rules and play by the rule book and ensure that fair play exists. A look forward to fair play in the retail sector. It is a pleasure to  This number was right to congratulate the people that he  But he was wrong to say that the Private Member's Bill fell on  It fell on a some deaf ears among step Liberal-Democrats, summon the Conservatives, and yes, some amongst my party at the time.

The reason why it did not get to the statute book, as you will require -- recalled as the money was on that very quick committee  was an occupational hazard that Members of Parliament have, a general election. But before that election we had minority parties and all of the three big parties to put it into their manifestos. That meant that whoever got in as the Government took this legislation  I think it is important that we have done it. At second reading as it that the Minister would go down in folklore and amongst the grocery industry for bringing this forward. We needed to have a proper adjudicator. There was a call for some time, no one argued and need for a code, but we did Archie and need for a referee and an adjudicator. -- did argue  I do single out one member for bringing this forward. I worked very closely with him on the Private Member's Bill. He was my  We had sponsors a round of the cross section of the United Kingdom to reach this comforts  This is good for consumers, good for producers and good for supermarkets. I think that supermarkets will come to terms with the best in the future and wonder what the fuss was all about. The adjudicator will be there,  and Bill all have the confidence in the future. Because of the time I will not go on, but I do want to thank everyone who has been involved. This is a proud day. It is a proud day for the whole industry and we as Parliament can be proud that we have reached a consensus and that you did it will become more and have the tools necessary to do the job and take this matter forward. Can I add my congratulations to everybody who has been involved right from the very early days, including my honourable friend from St Ives. One member said it was a pleasure to be  for me it was a shop, but nevertheless it was very welcome  I am delighted this Bill is now going through.

I hope this goal mac will be sufficient to make sure these malpractices are stamped out. I feel particularly strongly about the fresh produce the world where I feel these problems are most seen.  let me say this, there is a long-held cynical view that any piece of legislation which has all- party support is by definition bad. I hope that this one proves to be the exception to this rule. There is back round to thinking that about other pieces of legislation, but on this one house is right. I look forward to it for filling all the hopes that people have been it. First of all can I a plot the Government ministers? Their handling of this bill has been  They gave way in areas where there was compelling evidence and pressure to do so, they resisted but the thought it was appropriate to do so. That is what Government ministers should do. We push on issues that we think they need to here. It is an improved Bell and I do commend them for the way they have stared at this bill. I've it you for giving way, I want to give thanks to the officials who have served us so excellently. And also for their Christmas present of the plastic teeth.

We hope that their presence instils the code, but if not they will be there. I would like to say that indeed this Bill is an excellent example, despite of the consensus which is often considered a weakness, of how our Bill can be significantly improved during the parliamentary process. As well as congratulating many people we have been involved in  my honourable friend may have left out the Member for North Norfolk during his brief sojourn in that department as the Under  Heat during that process, introduced very significant change which was to enable it adjudicator to indeed receive and stimulate an inquiry on the basis of market intelligence.

De Klerk will now you read the private Bill set down for consideration.The City of London various Paras Bill's second  I beg to move that this will be read a second time. This bit of legislation that makes some relatively minor changes to street trading controls in the City of London and to the lot on the walkways within the Square Mile. The only place in which street trading can take is in the city is in Middlesex Street as part of the famous petticoat Lane market. The limitation of street trading can be traced back over a century and is reflected in the legislation which provides that such activities are confined to the street market in Middlesex Street. The reason for the city's particular code lies in its tomography as primarily at business and not a residential area and the unique demands which that demography imposes. This City of London was not always entirely at face of offices and for the commercial sphere. Up until the rise of the railways it was a significant residential place as  had over 130,000 residents in 1801 but dropped when the railways  The impact of the second world war meant that much of the residential population was around the Barbican area. That said, London's attractiveness as a tourist destination and the greater accessibility of the St Paul's area -- Olsen pulse from south of the river has meant that there has also been an increased demand for retail  in the Broadgate area and there may yet be further retail developments in the area around  It is particularly around this area at St Paul's Cathedral that new change adjacent to the cathedral that has prompted a review of the existing code. The aim has been to meet the needs of  while at the same time preserving the business environment that the City needs in order to  In consequence the City Corporation would like to utilise this build to liberalise the regime into specific respect. First, the Bill is designed to enable temporary street trading licences to be issued to enable the use of public thoroughfares for street markets or other events. The new retail developments at symbols aims to attract shoppers not just during the week but at weekends and provides a particular prompt as such a liberalisation would enable the holding of promotional  The timing of such events would have to be carefully  but the city is relatively empty during most weekends.  this Bill will allow it fought street trading of ice-cream and related products to be sold outside food premises. This is prompted by a greater tourist demand particularly in the vicinity of some Paul's Cathedral. It is difficult to imagine the consumption of ice-cream as an attraction in this very cold winter, but I hope it will be a matter of  or maybe months, when this will prove an extremely welcome  These changes are balanced by provisions for more effective enforcement of the street trading controls. This includes an increase in the maximum fine to the level that applies elsewhere in London and extending to the city the Paras available in other London boroughs to seize goods and property used in connection with unlawful street trading. I am well aware that this power of seizure may not be liked by all of my  even those honourable friend on the side of a House, including my honourable friend for Christchurch, but it reflects the Paras that are available in the rest of London, that we should point at this point that it does not go as far as a either in the City of Westminster or even in the London borough of Wandsworth. Street trading in the city is very limited in scope but what does  effective provisions are needed to control it. He will be aware that Bills which have recently been debated in the size, including the City of Nottingham  the Canterbury City Council  the Reading Borough Council Bill and the Leeds bill, they all contained similar provisions to the ones currently contained within  but all of them work cut out when those bills were considered in the other place. Those amendments were accepted in While is the City of London holding out against us? I think there is a case that the City of London is a different sort of local authority given the preponderance not of residential, but of office space and as a business quarter. The the corporation had tried to insure that we encourage tourism. There is a recognition that the Square Mile is a rather unusual area in this regards and therefore the limited changes that are being proposed here should apply for the City even if the great efforts that my honourable friend for Christchurch put into place at unsure that such changes are not made in places as far flung as Reading, Canterbury and Nottingham. These Paras are intended not only to deal with the problem ice-cream vans. These have given rise to numerous complaints from the public, schools, businesses and the chapter of symbols cathedral. The City has brought cases against these illegal  but the maximum fines there can be imposed have not been adequate to deter this activity, that is the reason why we are moving beyond the idea of a maximum fine to have a new power of seizure. Can he give the House some sort of idea of how many prosecutions there has been in ice cream vans in the last year? I shall endeavour to do so when you get to the committee  The fact of the matter is because prosecution is such an ineffective means because of the finds are so derisory, only £500, and we're trying to raise that to 000, but even at that level it is such a small fine that it is the power of seizure there would be more effective. The sheer cost of starting legal action is out waits many times compared to the money's there can be brought in through  Issues have been raised in connection with the Canterbury City Council and other new recent local bills about the use services  I thought it would be helpful if I went into more detail at this stage. The services directive came into force on December 20th, 2009. As it applies to the City of London, the Department for business innovation and skills are accepted in correspondence two years ago that the general prohibition on street trading can state. They stated that we think that that there is a reasonable argument that the complete provision on street trading except in respect of Middlesex Street is not all that the directive that will so does not need to be analysed against requirements of the directive. There were three issues raised by Baroness Wilcox. One might think is pertinent to this debates which will put on the record. Whether a provision restricting ice cream street sales to a business occupier might indirectly be discriminatory against every service providers who have no established premises in the  I accept that this does remain a live issue. Some of the concerns were set out in Correspondent in July 2011 and suggested that most business occupiers in that city would be business nationals and therefore it could be in direct the Industry Ministry -- discriminatory. The requirement is not likely to be on that proportionality principles that were held within a directive. The department suggested that we take independent legal advice on  The City Corporation as a result instructed leading counsel. This opinion was sent to Feb 3 -- sent to the Department this year. They said they may disagree with that opinion and confirmed on 19th February but without going into any reasons beyond stating that clause nine could be discriminatory. I need to go into a bit of detail  We feel this is something that should properly be dealt with at committee stage. The leading counsel's advice was the intended beneficiaries of the Bill are sellers or suppliers of food you're being allowed to trade a little way out side of the premises they  The commercial activity in the street is a spillover from back carried out within the associated premises and is therefore distinguishable from the right to sell ice-cream as a street trader. As a result it is subject to provisions on the freedom of establishment in the service  Council further advised that it is compatible in their view with the service directive as there is no does -- as there is no restriction of the can opener food business in the city. This Bill does not make it any harder to open such establishments. Many of the food businesses in the City of London are operated by nationals of any other member states. If I may say this for the satisfaction of my honourable friends from Christchurch, for the specific purposes of this second reading I believe strongly that this does not affect the other provisions in the  particularly temporary street trading licences. The Corporation of London will seek businesses view  We feel that there is a special case to be made here and given that the council's opinion on this is what it is, of flu this will prevail at committee stage. This is a matter that should be considered a committee should be aged and should not delay a second reading going through smoothly this  I would like to thank him for the full explanation. Does he share my concern that this is the European Union directive which is being incorporated into United Kingdom law and it doesn't seem at all clear as to what the implications are in particular cases such as this? I to have concerns over the lack of clarity given that this has been in play for over three years. The implications have not been worked  It is a concern that there is too much legislation from Europe now a which seems to get through on the not and then the problems about compatibility only become apparent at a later stage. There is clearly a question here, albeit one that we feel we have had some strong advice from leading counsel and we would hope to prevail as far as this matter is concerned when it is exam the committee stage. Utilities it a useful liberalising measure that should be welcomed by those working in the City and the hundreds and thousands who visit the city daily, and tourists who are counted in Pledge to my honourable friend, I will be happy to come back in conjunction with the city corporation with an amendment in committee stage if it appears that the advice from legal kouns sell contrary to the directive. I very much hope that we can proceed with this measure even though there is I accept still a small element of doubt in relation to the service Just to clarify, he is  is he, that the discussions on this will take place prior to the Bill being considered in  so that there is time for the Bill to be amended in committee to reflect the outcome of those discussions? Or is he saying that any amendments would come subsequent to the committee stage? Clearly it will not be imminent and hopefully there will be time for fully fledged discussions taking  given the counsel's opinion, and that it is hoped that it will be done in such a way that it will give an opportunity for amendments, but one hopes that we may be able to smooth over the case in advance  But obviously that's something that I will willingly do speaking on behalf of the corporation to try and get this Bill through at committee stage whenever we are able to arrange such further proceedings. I think the corporation is rightly of the view that the street trading provisions in this Bill are winter with the directive. The Government in the shape of these officials have indicated that they are content on two of the three main points raised in connection but more recently have expressed concerns about the third point that we've discussed at an earlier stage. Clearly white not be in the interests of anyone, least of all the city corporation as sponsors of  to do anything that would be regarded as contrary law. We need clarification on this. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I can town the Bill in a little more detail. The substantive provisions begin with clauses 3-5 which make provision for temporary street trading licences. These will last for up to 21 days and can be granted for any area in the City other than Middlesex Street. The organisers would be able to apply for a licence for any number of traders. Clause 6 will bring the maximum fine for street tradings into line with the rest of London. Currently 000, a level 3 fine rather 000 for a level 2. It is to harmonise the situation. On clause 7, this provides for seizure and forfeiture of vehicles and goods used for the purposes of unlawful street trading. This is in substance the same set of powers that exists in the rest of Greater London under the London Local authorities Act of 1927. Seized property may be for fitted by the court on conviction of a person of the offence, or sold to meet an award of costs there. Must otherwise be a return to the person from whom it is seize odd. Provision is made here for the disposal of property which cannot be returned and for compensation for any unlawful seizure. Special provision is made for the return or disposal of motor vehicles or perishable items. Clause 7 also enable as fixed penalty not be given for illegal straight trading in the same way as the rest of Greater London and areas outside of the capital. Clause 8 will end the need tone act a bylaw for street traders. This procedure is so cumbersome that the charge for street trade ers in the City has remained unchanged over the last 24 years. Only MPs' salaries have remained unchanged for that length of time. But maybe I exaggerate slightly. In neighbouring Tower Hamlets, street  £32, and Middlesex Street is a street which is bisected. It runs essentially from north-west to south-east along the southern side of that line is in the City of London and the northern side is Tower Hamlets. So it would make sense to harmonise this charge. Is he able to produce evidence before the House as to what the impact is on supply and demand of having street trading charges had are currently below the level in Tower Hamlets for example? Having been a  mainly before my time before I was a member of Parliament to petticoat lane, this was some  not withstanding the differentiation of charges, it didn't seem there was a particular disincentive to having a stall in Tower Hamlets rather than the City  I should stress the charge is designed tonight reflect relevant costs. Having been set at £15 since 1989, essentially to pit up to £32 won't make a huge imposition to those who work on the City side of middle sex Street. Clause 9 allows the selling of ice  If approved, a stall may be set up within 15 metres of the business premises. This distance was chosen and considered as a reasonable maximum outer limit given the nature of the public areas where the sale of ice cream might take place. If a location closer to the premises deemed be more appropriate, I believe that could also be set by the corporation.  Madam Deputy Speaker clause 10 makes two small changes to the law on City walk ways. Shy say these walkways are neither footpaths nor high gais the conventional sense but private access ways over which the public is give an right to pass on foot. This concept was initiated by the City by a private Bill enacted as long ago as 1967. Walkways are found for example in the Barbican. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, when the dream of creating the Barbican and indeed creating essentially a business district with relatively few residents within the City of London after the rebuilding following the bombing in the Second World War, we envisaged walkways at first floor  This first provision enables the Corporation to impose a charge to recoup the relative costs incurred whenever there's a variation of a walkway asked for by  The second element is for a fee where there is unlawful park on footpath. In conclusion Mr Deputy Speaker I believe this Bill is a modest measure aimed at relaxing the economisting street trading code in the City of London to provide important flexibility. This I believe will enhance the attractiveness and the vitality of the City both for its residents and it should be said that for the first time in over two centuries we've seen an increase the the residential pop inflation the City of London during the most recent  but white apply to those who work and visit the City. The emergence of new change as a shopping centre means the City will become an attractive place over the  and more shops are open on Saturdays and sufpbltdz I therefore ask this House to give the Bill a second reading. THE SPEAKER:The question is that the Bill be now read a second time.  Thank you Mr Deputy  I rise only briefly, because as honourable members will  traditionally the Government neither supports nor opposes private bills unless they contain provisions contrary to public policy. In those case it is the Government's role to bring such metres the attention of the House. It is for that reason that I wish to set out today the Government's concern about the Bill's compatibility with the requirement of the European services directive, which the honourable gentleman has referred to. This concern ho already been raised during the second reading demb the other place by Baroness Wilcox. Despite some developments on the issue, the promoters of the Bill haven't yet been able to satisfy us that all of the concerns we raised have been  If good news however is back in 2011 we had several concerns about the Bill's compatibility the drifbgt and now we've only one. Mr Deputy Speaker, the remaining concern relates to clause 9 of the Bill, as has been  trading outside business  which seeks to allow only those businesses, only those with business premises to sell ice cream from a recepticle outside those  It than Government's view that this clause doesn't comply with the services directive, because it may indirectly discriminate against non-UK  Our concern therefore remains the same as in 2011 but I fleerbt the promoters of the Bill have sought external -- I appreciate that the promoters of the Bill have sought outside opinion and the Government hopes it will be possible to reach agreement on this issue before committee  If this cannot be agreed, in that scenario we would of course be compelled to submit a report to the House setting out the legal listens why we believe that clause 9 doesn't apply to the services  This discussion is ongoing to try to get real clarity on that legal point. Can she explain what would happen in that scenario that the Government can't agree with the promoters, they would issue a certificate, but where would that leave us as electors? What would happen? Would this be before the committee stage, so that the committee dealing this Bill could respond to the Government's view? Or would it be left until later? This Bill might not come back for a report stage.  my honourable friend raises an important point. Obviously it is a formal process if the Government reports against a Bill that it is not compatible with provisions that we are signed up to. If we think there's a legal problem with it. As I have just said, we hope that we'll be able to reach agreement on this issue before committee stage, but we will keep the House informed of where that has got to. That will enable to House to assess these issues in the light of the Government's advice and assessment of the legal situation. I think that is ongoing. This new legal opinion has been produced. That has to be properly considered, but I wanted to make sure this issue was flagged to the House so that if this does come to the situation where the Government has to issue such a report, that won't suddenly be a surprise to the House. It may well yet be that that the doesn't come to pass. I think that's the only comment the Government wishes to put on the Bill. I'm sure the rest of the second reading debate will continue. THE SPEAKER: Mr Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. It would seem to me, given that this is the second reading debate on this birth, the local members' view should should be har mount in terms of the way the private legislation is working for. The Member for City of London did say it would enhance the City of London. I hope we take cognisance of that. I've been skimming through the Bill. I was told I was doing this Bill shortly before the honourable member stood to promote it. I'm fas knighted by clause 9 of the Bill. I think of my own city of Edinburgh, the vibrant nature of the City. Hopefully if this we allow this to go to committee and the business department can find a way of resolving this issue, hopefully it will come into enactment. £15 for a street traird's licence sounds like a bargain to me. I'm sure street traders up and down the country will wonder why it is so cheap in the City of London and not in their own patches. If it means we can wander down the streets of the City of London and buy an ice cream from an approved place of sale, we are willing to do that. We don't have objections to this. It is worth reminding ourselves that if there hadn't been a blocking motion put down against this Bill we wouldn't be having a second reading didn't. White have gone through on the nod. What we've heard so far with the very helpful explanation given by my honourable friend shows the importance of ensuring that we do have a second reading debate of a Bill of this import, Bates may not be affecting the whole of the country bit strovs some importance Prince parents. As we've heard, it may impact upon national law in the sense of the European Union services directive as it has been incorporated into United Kingdom  I'm rather disappointed the Member for Edinburgh admits to only having just got to grips with this  because there's been a lot of notice of this Bill, as the Minister has said, it was being discussed in the other place as recently as April 2011. I'm surprised that the honourable gentleman hasn't briefed himself sooner on it. If he had done so he might have been in a position to help the debate that there's going  particularlyning relation to the very draconian powers of seizure and forfeiture in relation to ice cream vans and other means of what are described as having recepticles for the purposes of Bill at its second reading, it is worth looking at it in the context of where we are, in relation to the whole regime of street trading and  because the Government has said that there is a consultation going on at the moment. The terms of which have been  so the consultation period is extended now into the middle of next month. But this is a consultation on street trading and peddlery and it is designed to bring the attention of Parliament to the issues arising from the EU services directive. And the EU services directive, which was originally implemented and was thought then to have no impact whatsoever upon street trading, it is now apparently got such an impact on street trading that the Government is talking about the only way of ensuring compliance would be to abolish the peddlers' legislation completely. Obviously the City of London regime is one which exempts the City of London from some of the provisions of the peddlers' acts. But the Government's agenda seems to be to do away with peddlery altogether and to - because there is an issue about equal access to street  effectively deny people the right that they've had - the privilege they've had of being able to trade freely in this country on the basis of having a certificate from a Police Authority that they are of good character. As is clear from what the minister was saying, the implication of that maybe that it indirectly discriminates against non-EU nationals. But, on the other  since when have we said in this country that there shouldn't be some privileges associated with being a British citizen? Here, here. I would have thought that that is one of the principles that is upheld very strongly in the City of  I would like to pay tribute, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the work that he has done in the City of London. It is the heart of the British  Here, here.And I think that it's exercised over many years and generations, indeed, a form of local self-government, which is an exemplar for other local authorities up and down the land. I was very much involved in trying to ensure that powers to take over the city City of London and make it just like any other borough were not carried through. Which brings me on to my point, which is - just because there are provisions relating to street trading in other boroughs in London. The honourable  my honourable friend refers r referred to Wandsworth, that in my opinion, should be why it should be allowed to retain its status adds being different, being praud to be different and just because some boroughs seem to have gone down the road of wanting to be rather heavy-handed in the way in which they deal with enforcement and forfeit tour, that is no reason why -- forfeiture, that is no reason why it should apolyin the City of London. Mr -- apply in the City of London. I hope my honourable friend will accept that there is a reason for not being uniform or homogenised, that there is - I give way. I would naturally agree that the City of London is special, aloof, special at least, perhaps compared to all London Boroughs, except for the City of Westminster that I also represent in this House. I wouldn't want my other City to be upset. The point he is making right. We accept as far as peddleries are concerned there is a set of different rules for over a sench triin the City of  -- a century. It was to make the case, why did the City of London want the maximum 000, rather than £500, that is to harm yonise with other local authorities. My fear, as I said earlier, even that £1,000 level will be insufficient as a disincentive unless it is commensurate with having certain powers of seizure for those persistent offenders against these bylaws. I'm grateful for that intervention. But dealing with the issues of the levels of fines - and I don't blame him for this - I would be more impressed if there was hard evidence before us of the number of cases brought to court or the number of cases where cautions have been given or the number of offences which couldn't be prosecuted for one reason or  Why should we accept an  because we have been during the course of this discussing a lot of street trading and peddlery bills, there have been a lot of assertions made by promoters of one sort or another. And I don't want to taint the City of London Corporation with any of the problems of others. But it would be helpful if my honourable friend has any evidence. Well, the sheer cost of bringing legal proceedings is exorbitant. The nature of a fiernings even set at 000, let alone the current level of £5 Sunday a strong disincentive, given that is auto the maximum fine for a persistent offender and as my honourable friend is well aware, here in central London, whether it is a ice-cream van for hamburger  a huge amount of money can be made in a short time given the sheer foot-flee if in London. It is of particular concern, without necessarily having any evidence of the numbers of have gone down this whole legal process, given that the  shopping parade has  and this is something that has only been up and running for the last 18 months or so, and it is that emergence that will make London a more attractive proposition during weekends, for significant numbers of tourists who  therefore, - and therefore I'm afraid it'll adract more would-be illegal ice-cream  -- it'll attract. It is for that reason that we feel we should move ahead.This is bordering on your initial moving of  I think Mr Chope got  I was tempted the intervene on my honourable friend. I'm very grateful to my honourable friend for expanding upon that  An important point. I'm grateful to you, Mr Deputy Speaker for your indulgence to enable the point to be made in the way it was. I accept the City of London is in a separate position from other local  And, I would like to turn to the specifics, in this particular Bill and manufacture away from some of the generalities, Mr Deputy Speaker. The power in relation to temporary street trading in clause 3 is, effectively a liberating provision, compared with the current regime. Bus it would enable street trading to be carried out over limited periods, as the memorandum makes clear - it is a relaxation of the restrictive  So, I'm not going to argue against that, because I think that would be arguing against the principles which I have fought hard for in many bl bills of a similar nature before this House. -- in  I wouldn't quibble with the detailed contents of temporary street trading. I give way. I'm very grateful and I share his view. But in terms scrutiny of the Bill is my learned friend happy that they relax the arrangements sufficiently? Well, I think my honourable friend knows the answer  I would like to see a much more relaxed arrangement. But any relaxation is probably better than  And I think that the importance of people being able to enter into the marketplace as  without the need for  I think is absolutely fundamental in an entrepreneurial  Obviously the City of London epitomises the entrepreneurial society. I think that's why it is good that the City of London should be encouraging street traders, people who are starting out in business life and  to be able to show what they are worth and by getting a street trading licence and obviously initially perhaps, like  Mr Deputy Speaker, doing on a very much deputy basis and seeing how it goes. So, I think that clause 3 is a clause I hope I don't have to eat these words later - a clause for good. And so, I would support that. And the - so I think the issue of temporary licences is not one that really concerns me. But what does concern me is the weather the case for increased penalties has been  Because it is easy to say it's expensive to prosecute and we know that companies will say - well we don't prosecute people who are  bus it is not worth  because it is going to cost us so much to do it and when we get them before the courts, the fines are going to be so derisory, that it won't achieve much of purpose and it is going to be putting us to quite a lot of  That argument is quite often put forward on behalf of public authorities who are funded by local or national taxpayer resources. But having said all that, we are in a country which believes in the rule of law, and I would have thought this is a very important principle of the rule of law that an enforcement authority, if it feels that there have been breaches of specific bylaws or local acts which are to the detriment to the people in that area, that they should be quite happy to prosecute, recognising that there is a cost associated with that. Ultimately the taxpayer pays a lot of money for prosecuting people, and if they are convicted and sentenced to  even more money for keeping them in prison but that doesn't mean we say it is a good thing to  bus it is a matter of an important principle. -- because it is a matter. I don't believe that just because it is not financially expedient from the point of view of the prosecuting authorities, to bring prosecutions because they don't think they're going to get sufficient money back from so doing. I'm not sure that that really impresss me in relation to clause 5, clause 6 of the bill. Apart from anything else. The penalties that will be increased, they will be core penalties and they won't actually go to the benefit of the City of London local council tax  as far as I understand. -- court penalties. Those penalties would actually go into helping to meet the costs of the national  bus they are pooled for very -- because they are pulled for very understandable reasons. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a much greater problem with clause 7. Here,  Because, as I said in an intervention, these enforcement -  return of seized items, compensation, forfeiture of seized  seizure of perishable articles and motor vehicles and disposal orders. These provisions have been considered on a number of occasions by members of this House. Most recently in relation to four private bills promoted by the City  the City of Nottingham, the City of Khan Canterbury and by Reading brew Council and in respect of all those bills, these provisions, dealing with enforcement and sezure, etc, --  they were cut out of  My honourable friends  but this is London and these provisions have gone through in relation to other London local  And it is right to say that that is true but that has been against the wishes, certainly of my honourable friend from Shipley who the other side of that coin is that the City of London seems to have managed perfectly well up to now, no big issue and now we are seeing under these provisions suddenly the need to engage in quite draconian seizure provisions. I know that my honourable friend is very fair minded but he will know that a number of Bills, it seems that they are drafted by the same people,  That may well be so, because often we have the same solicitors acting or the same acts acting on behalf of the different local authorities. But the expression if one looks at clause 7  Mr Deputy Speaker, The  it starts off on the wrong  because it says subject to subsection 2 if an authorised officer or a Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting. The tradition has always been you need a reasonable ground for belief. Very hard to disprove a reasonable ground for suspicion, because suspicion is something which is subjective anyway. So to only have to establish a reasonable ground for suspicion is really not to have to establish anything whatsoever, in terms of the person having a  All that you have to do is to establish a reasonable ground for suspecting. I hope my honourable friend will take on board thinking about whether this is something he should volunteer to bring forward an amendment in  that a lot of similar bills and provisions where we've put down amendments, those have been accepted on the basis that reasonable grounds for belief is a much fairer way of expressing the  the point which my honourable friend and the promoters of this Bill want to address. Whatever else I'm sure the City of London wouldn't want to be accused of being anything other than fair minded on the rule of law. The City of London could do nothing other than be fair mind. The reasonable grounds of suspicion are in place. It should be said for Westminster City Council and the London borough  they were given powers to seize equipment that an officer believed was intended to be used. An even stronger basis. I hope he will accept that's not entirely  although he makes a valid point about the distinction between belief and suspicion. I'm grateful to my honourable friend for what he says. At the same time we've got the Government with its consultation paper saying that they believe there should be uniformity across the country. So much so that they are saying that if they will bring forward national legislation or regulation changes to which local authorities can apply to opt  so that effectively the Government will impose from the centre a uniform regime to cover issues such as this, whether it is an issue of reasonable grounds for belief or suspicion or whatever. But there would be standard tests right across this whole regime of street trading and dealing with the enforcement of infringements of street trading. Again, and I know it is easy to argue the case of prematurity on bills such as this, but I could be grateful if my honourable friend will respond to  In fairness there's a lot to be said for having a national law and to standardise these issues. It would be essential to have provisions to take account of the City's own unique circumstances. But we have to live where we are at. Clearly the Government is phenomenally busy with a huge amount of legislation that it is bringing through on a range of  some of which I understand my honourable friend has some support for. The reality of the situation is that we aren't going to get uniformity or harmonisation any time soon socts through the provision of this private -- so it is through the provision of this Bill that we need to make progress. Last night I was in the City of  in the old Guildhall  where the Member for  the Minister of State, was making a speech entitled Deregulation for Growth. I'm sure a principle that both of abuse be very much supportive of. (Inaudible) Exactly. There were too many examples of legislation which comes forward which is regulation which is going to be counter productive to the policy of promoting growth in our economy. That's why anything that the City of London does in relation to more regulation is obviously going to come under more scrutiny than if it is done by a Littleborough council somewhere else in the country. -- by a little Borough Council somewhere else in the country. To the ensure that we get growth in the economy and the successful financial services and pro federal services industry in the City of  -- professional. It is in that background that I raise concerns that I do about clause 7 of this Bill. I'm grateful, as he knows I very much agree with him about giving local authorities of any description the power of  especially on such flimsy evidence as in this particular claufpltz I wonder whether my honourable friend was reassure -- particular claufpltz I wonder whether my honourable friend was assured by subsection two where it says it can only be seized if it may be used in evidence. Is my honourable friend reassured by that or is that merely a mask for something that is still unacceptable?Well, I was going to come on to this, but I think that on the face of it, that doesn't  but on the other hand if one looks at the later provisions of clause 7, one can see that there are difficulty about  Section 16A1 which would be inserted after section 16 of the  in 1C it says that any of the authorised the officer or Constable may seize any recepticle or equipmenting with used by that  My honourable friend will know from having read this Bill that a recepticle as it is describe could be a motor car, or van selling ice creams. So we are talking about potentially quite valuable rep Septembercles or pieces of -- recepticles or pieces of equipment. The mere fact of having them seized could cause a significant problem for the person from whom they are seized. Particularly if they are seized on dubious grounds. A my concern, and I wonder if it is one that he  is that says that it can only be seized if it may be required to be used in evidence. Does my honourable friend agree that that doesn't create any safeguards at all? On that basis anything could be seized on the basis that it may be required. It doesn't mean that is required only that it may be required. My honourable friend makes a good  Further down the Bill he will see that can be retained for up to six months, on the basis that it may be required in connection with a prosecution, the prosecution may never take place and the person's been deprived of their goods for six months that. May have achieved the objective of the enforcement authorities but it certainly generates a grave  My honourable friend may  for the person who has been the victim of that seizure. That is why there needs to be a proper balance between the rights and responsibilities under the provisions of this Bill dealing with enforce: We should be most reluctant to give powers of seizure to Constableed on the one hand, but in goes further than, that because these powers extend to authorise  These could be any, as it  any officer or employee of the corporation, or any person to whom any enforcement function under this part 4 is to be discharged, or any employee of any such person. We are getting quite remote from the person who is in charge, Mr Deputy  and the more remote we are from the person who is in charge, the more scope there is for abuse. If the only redress is something that may come six months late, it may not be redress at off. Say the ice cream van is taken, the recepticle is seized in March, by the time it could be returned in  by which time the main selling season for ice creams, Mr Deputy Speaker, will have passed. So effectively the livelihood of that person will have been taken away from them for the duration of  That illustrates the potential gravity of what's being proposed in these provisions. And  my honourable friend might say 16B deals with the return of seized things, articles or  The subject to Article 8 following the conclusion of the  the article or things should be returned to the person from whom it was seized. But again the Dev sill in the detail, because -- the devil is in the detail. Take for example the return of an ice cream van under section 16B5, where a recepticle seized is a motor vehicle used for ice cream trading, the corporation or Commissioner of the police shall within three days of the receipt of an application in writing by the owner or registered keeper permit the person to remove  to take it back, but he wouldn't be able to take it back where the circumstances mentioned in subsection 7 apply. One of those is perfectly reasonable, that the person has been convicted of an offence under the Act already. I'm not going to quibble about that. But I do quibble with 16B6B, which says that it could apply in the circumstances where the owner or registered keeper of the vehicle is being prosecuted for a previous alleged offence. In other words, one gets arrested and prosecuted. The proceedings haven't been  The presumption of innocence surely continues to apply and yet the mere fact that you are being prosecuted puts but in a more prejudicial position than if there is no prosecution. It seems to me that if one's wanting to look at the detail of this Bill, and it is reason to believe look at some of the issues that might be wished to be raised in committee, Mr Deputy  it seems to me that that particular provision, 16B6B, which removes the ability of a person to recover their ice cream van within three days of it being removed, but not if they are being prosecuted for another offence. It seems to me that that is dray conian. It is over the top. Unnecessary. I very much agree with my honourable friend but will he turn his eye to C as well? Not only is it as he suggests but it is if the vehicle has been used in the commission of such an offence or a previous alleged offence is. My honourable friend aware of exactly who has to determine whether it has been used in such an offence? Or how on allegation of an offence will apply. It seems to me that that seems rather loose as well.Well, my honourable friend's on to a good point as well. Because it doesn't say that the vehicle has to have been used in the commission of such an offence by the sim person. It could be a vehicle -- by the same  It could be a vehicle which had been acquired in an auction or by a private treaty sale by somebody in all innocence from a previous ice cream vendor, and the  the new vehicle owner wouldn't though that that particular vehicle had been used in the commission of an offence in the  So the new owner of the vehicle is being penalised because unknown to him the vehicle had been used for the commission of an offence in the past. Surely that would be rather unreasonable as  If services directive wants to create a level playing field, then I urge my honourable friend the Minister to start looking what she thinks there should be a level playing field which isn't here at the moment between those who've purchased ice cream vans, who find out later that the ice cream van has been used in connection with an offence in the City of London and those who purchase ice cream van which is haven't been used for such offences in the past. There should be a level playing field between It is clearly to say, whether someone committed an offence, they should not be entitled to continuously do this, because the wheels of the legal process take a long time to work in place. It is  in the City of London, to do with ice-cream vendors. I'm sure that repeated offences or repeated patterns of behaviour, are, indeed as my honourable friend says  Quite often to deal  is to get a civil injunction in the County Court or  There is no need to bring into this scope a whole lot of people who maybe innocents at  just because it's quite come  sometimes to proceed with getting an injunction. --  But an injunction is a legitimate way of restpraining that. How would my honourable friend would feel if the council was taking out injunctions at vast courts rather than dealing with. We deal daily with constituents getting in touch with us, who are concerned with lack of enforcement action for a variety of reasons. This seemed to be a sensible enforcement provision, going down the root of an expensive and time- consuming injunction would not be a sensible way forward. I'm not sure I agree with that. One of the benefits of an injunction is that it can be a breach thain junction can result in somebody brought brought before the court for contempt of court and ultimately they can lose their liberty. That's going further here. All we are talking about here is the liberty of ice-cream vans but with  the person themselves can lose physical liberty because they are in contempt of court. I don't think my honourable friend should belittle the long-standing and traditional use of injunctions  as a means of getting a proper and effective remedy against persistent behaviour, which is, I  none of us are trying to support that. I mean, none of the arguments I put forward in relation to any of these bills have I ever wanted to excuse unlawful or encourage unlawful behaviour. All I wanted to do is to try and ensure that the response is proportionate and that people who are innocent are not brought up in the pan pleaia of effectively the criminal law without know being it. And in this particular case, somebody could find themselves on the wrong side of losing their ice-cream van when they didn't know it had ever been used before. I must confess, I had hoped my honourable friend would be delighted it see ten subclauses to this particular bill dealing with the return and only three dealing with the seizure itself. Mr Deputy Speaker, is almost a commentary upon regulation. That we regulate and then in order to  we have to put in provisions which are a lot more complicated than the regulation itself. Reverting momentarily to the brilliant lecture I attended last  One of the representatives there from a large City firm said - we must be alert to the danger of comforting complexity. I think that's actually quite a good thing to bear in mind when we're looking at this type of regulation, because my honourable friend says we bring in these controls, we bring in these controls and powers to seize and then we have it set out, at even greater length, the exemptions to the seizure regime. How complicated can that be? I think it is unnecessarily complicated, unnecessarily regulatory and,  unnecessarily burdensome upon people who might be wanting to start out in life with a new enterprise which could ultimately result in them becoming a multi- millionaires and working for people in the City or indeed any of those other positions in the City which are so despised by members on the other side of this House. But which we realise are so important to the British economy.  that's by the by. I don't quite catch what the honourable gentleman said. May I ask him and my aapologies for not being here. Did he say the honourable members despise the City. I'll not accuse the honourable gentleman for despising the City of  If he wants to put on record his support, he can contribute to this debate. But there are honourable members who'll give the impression that they are very hostile. I'm sure the ice- cream van awaits your delivery of a fresh debate, rather than going somewhere elsewhere we need not be. It is not like you to be tempted away in other directions. Let's get back to where we should be. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right to have a go at the victim, which is me in this position, but I was  But I accept that full responsibility for being led astray in that particular intervention. So, I will deal with that issue of  If your product is  it is of absolute importance that you shouldn't find that the consequences of -aifg it seized are that it loses all its  -- of having it seized.  I'm not sure at all that the provisions relating to perishable items, set out on page 7  that those provisions are  Bus it says no articles which is of perishable nature shall be seized under the provisions of - - because it says. Under 16 A, .. Under section 2 from the person or article from which it  What is disappointing, I would have thought that the best thing to do would be to say that nothing that is perishable should  In the case of an ice- cream van it, would be quite  for example, Mr Deputy  to remove the ice-cream from the van and just seize the van, if that is what has to be done. But I think when you are talking about the seizure of perishable articles, we are talking about quite an oppressive power, and the exercise of that power. So, what does it say under section 16 (2) is says where a perishable article is seized, the person from whom it is seized should be given notice in writing given the address of where it can be collect inane stated if he is not the owner, then the owner should be given the information in paragraphs A and B. So on the face of it it should ensure that perishable articles are not going to be seized but when you look at the small print, they are going to  And that is unfair and unjust and indeed has been removed from a lot of similar bills which are before this House, because our  on this side of the  I can't think of those on theeer side of the House, thought they were disproportionately heavy in their application to ordinary people.  Mr Deputy Speaker, if one hadn't realised that already, I have some grave concerns about the powers of seizure, and particularly, when they are dealing with items which are of greater value than the maximum penalties, under the Bill, there is a specific provision on the Bill of saying that it is open to the Government, to the authorities to seize equipment or - including motor vehicles, which will be of value, higher than the maximum fine that can be imposed under any circumstances. That's effectively depriving people of their assets. Perhaps on a temporary basis but nevertheless depriving of those assets in a disproportionately heavy manner. I give way. I wonder if my honourable friend was going to mention the section on xe compensation for seizure? -- compensation on seizure? Particularly in the sense if my honourable friend looks at it, in 16 (D) subsection 4 "The court may only make an order for compensation if satisfied that seizure was not lawful under section 16 (A) which comes back to the reasonable grounds for suspicion, which, seems  Mr Deputy Speaker, to  so as to make sure that compensation never has to be paid, even when it's been taken wrongly, so to speak. My honourable friend is right and as is so often, by looking at all the language in the Bill, Mr Deputy  one is able to see that the consequences are, that it is going to be very tough. Because the exemptions are so hedged around, that it is going to be very difficult for anybody to comply with an exemption, particularly if the ultimate test is whether or not somebody has a reasonable suspicion. And it goes back to that particular faultline that is running through these particular clauses in this Bill.  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a lot of concerns about these powers, and particularly, as they relate to motor vehicles and to perishable goods and the other stuff relating to disposal orders. I don't think we need to get into the detail of that at the moment.  as far as clause 8 of the bill is concerned, that deals with charges for licensed street traders and I have always tried to be fair and give credit where it is due and I think that my honourable friend makes a strong case for saying that if you've got a street trading - a street where on one side of the road is controlled by one local authority and the other side of the road by another local authority, that there is an argument for saying that both - the prices for both local authorities should be  It is rather like, my right honourable friend may remember - I think our right honourable friend, the Foreign  he was living in a street which was actually in Lambeth and the other side of the street was in Wandsworth and there was an enormous dissparrity in the level of rates, the ones in council  the ones in Lambeth being higher than Wandsworth. That's by  That shows, Mr Deputy  the sensitivity of people, where you have got one part of the street in one borough and another part of the street in another local authority area and people saying - well there is big differential honourable friend that the Minister has changed place and he can now commend the current incumbent on the front bench on his excellent speech from last night. I have already done so. Speaker quite rightly Mr Chope has pointed out he's already congratulated that speech and I'm sure he was nearly coming to the end of where he needs be on this Bill rather than on the ability of someone speaking last night in the Library. I don't think it was on whether congratulations would be given but The next item and this is the item I'm delighted that my right honourable friend is on the front bench to listen to, because this is the issue which concerns his own  That is in relation to  trading outside business  Obviously for reason which is I can again understand, the City of London is saying in order to bring more vibrancy to life in the City of London, particularly at weekends and for tourists y not allow people to sell ice creams off the street rather than just from fixed locations in shops and cafes? They are saying that if you should be able to sell ice creams from a at the Septembercle, which could include an -- from a recepticle which could include an ice cream van close to business premises. I'm not sure whether the definition of business premises included St Paul's Cathedral chapter or not. And whether St Paul's Cathedral themselves will be involved in this  I don't think St Paul's should be included in business premises. There are other businesses in the curtilage of St Paul's Cathedral and they would be included. Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm grateful to my honourable friend for that. While I might quibble with the fact that the corporation is retaining to itself the ability to approve the  location and the purpose of the recepticle, I think the principle is a good one. I canned understand why it should be -- I can't understand why it should be thought why this may indirectly discriminate against non- nationals, which is what the Minister who spoke earlier said she thought it  How or in what way is it going to? My honourable friend with all the resources of the City of London behind him has, at the behest of the department, got leading counsel's opinion on this, and leading counsel's opinion is submitted to the department in  By 14th February, they get a holding reply. By 19th February the department has already decided that leading counsel's  which has taken many months to produce, is wrong. Where does that leave everybody? Surely this is something that should have been anticipated by the department a long time ago. It was that department that brought forward the proposals for implementing services  Even now two years after it has been implemented we can't even get a definitive ruling as to whether it applies in such a way as to effectively outlaw or negate the legitimate aspiration of the City of London to enable people who've already got businesses operating in the City of London to extend those businesses for the purposes of selling ice creams when the season  It seems to me that we must be absolutely mad if we think that this is, sthit be outlawed because it may indirectly discriminate against non- EU  Ip vit the Minister to - - I invite the Minister to think of any legislate mur within the European Union say they thought it was right to bring in a provision like this which would enable their own people to be able to engage in enterprise because it might indirectly discriminate against Brits for example. I can't believe that sort of argument would be given the time of day in any other Parliament within the European  I hope that this can be  But there's a procedural and process issue here, Mr Deputy  because this Bill as I understand it, there were no petitions against this Bill, so this Bill will go into unopposed Bill economy. Unless the Bill is amended in economy, it will not be possible for this House to amendment the Bill later, because it won't have a report stage, which is an issue which we had with the City of Nottingham Bill, the Canterbury City Council Bill and so  Because they were not opposed, they it won't the other place, where they were opposed. But this Bill has already been to the other  and therefore it is quite important that perhaps in responding to this debate my honourable friend will be able to make explicit what I think is pretty explicit already, exactly how he and the city corporation are going to negotiate with the department over the proper interpretation of clause 9 vis-a- vis the services drifbgt. Not good -- directive. There won't be any scope under the procedures of this House and the other place to make amends later. It is a -- if a certificate is produced of incompatibility, where will that lead?The Corporation of London would not wish any legislation to go through that is not part of EU  This issue needs be resolved before we can proceed on second  I'm confident we'll be able to get this matter involved in such a way that will satisfy not just my honourable friend but the department and indeed the promoters of this Bill. On that point Mr Deputy Speaker, my honourable friend refers to the need to get the second reading dealt with today. Obviously as it is implicit from what I've been saying, there are lots of parts of this Bill completely I think are good. There are parts that I'm not so happy  There are some issues which I think need to be resolved. I'm not minded to be against the second  I think that what my honourable friend does is he brings to these debates a constructive  which is nothing more or less than we would expect from him, friend the City of London himself. They recognise that some of us believe these bills are better discussed rather than pushed through without proper discussion. I hope in that spirit some of the concerns I've expressed during this short contribution to the second reading debate can be reflect upon to see whether any amendments might be brought forward at the committee  Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm not off an lost for words in relation to the detail of bills but I don't really have anything to say about the issue of City walkways contained in clause 10. Surely not! I think that the analogy of a walkway and a foot path is one that any reasonable person would accept, and certainly I'm not going to quibble with that. Having put on record some of my concerns about this I would like to congratulate my honourable friend on the way in which he's brought this Bill so far  and hope that in due course he's able to get some clarity and perhaps from the department even some admissions that they've let people down by not implementing or not realising what the EU services drifbgt implications were for street -- directive implications were for street trading in this country. THE SPEAKER: Is the Member for Shipley trying to catch my eye in this  am I correct in saying he wasn't here for the beginning of this debate? I was here by had to pop out for a drink. I'm sure he might like to apologise before I bring him in to speak. I am grateful and I do apologise for the discourtesy for you and to my honourable friends the member City  I did pop out for a drink from the previous debate, where I was on duty for quite some  It was tea though wasn't it! It was indeed. I did watch the monitor while drinking that said  so I did catch the points that my honourable friend  I don't intend to detain the House for long, will you be relieved to know, and I'm sure you didn't expect me to. But I wanted to start off where my honourable friend the Member for Christchurch  by congratulating my honourable friend for the stis of London and Westminster. -- Citys of  He does listen to the debate and to the Northern Alliance  He is a reasonable -- and to the points that are made. Where points are made he will respond in a positive way. We haven't always seen that in previous private business and I think we should commend our honourable friend on the approach he takes on these  I have to say as well, Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill certainly isn't as bad as some of the Bills we previously looked at. I think that my honourable friend from Christchurch made the point that some of the clauses in the Bill are actually positive changes. I think we would certainly welcome. I might just say Mr Deputy Speaker that on these occasions it is always right that we congratulate my honourable friend for Christchurch for the way he croute theses this type of  It would be -- for the way he scrutinises this type of legislation. These bills would otherwise go through on the nod. It is to his credit that we scrutinise these things in some detail so that we can try and avoid those pitfalls Terms of the different clauses in  I, like my honourable  very much support the purpose of clause 3 and temporary street trading. As my honourable  this is quite clearly a relaxation of legislation. This is going to enable more people to engage in entrepreneurial enterprise and for that we should  I would just point out, I'm not entirely sure what exactly will always be in mind when this particular part of the Bill is brought into play and the licence  It strikes me as if really it is not really done for the benefit of entrepreneurs, as my honourable friend seemed to think when he was extolling the virtues of this particular clause. My honourable friend for Christchurch seemed to suggest this would be good as it was a benefit to entrepreneurs. I'm not sure that's the purpose of this clause of the it may be the end product of the  It seems to me that what really is the purpose behind this is the City of London may on occasion want to have some swish event or not even a swish event but just an event, a celebratory event  on the streets of the City  It may well be that in order to make that event as good as possible and to make it as appealing as possible for people to  thraeflsed that that would be assisted by -- they've realised that it would be assisted by the provisions of this clause. Without these provisions it may well not be a popular event that they've organised so it is for their benefit as opposed for the people that my honourable friend seemed to think it was intended to benefit. I don't think there is any desire to take place in bar that will emue Fair or any other things like that that happened in London -- Bartholemew.  if there are short fairs,  if there are short fairs, I'm grateful for that and that is  the people who run the City of London will change over  It may well be that they take a different view about the levels of traders that are needed. It may well have been helpful, it may still be helpful if it made it clear on the face of the Bill about the levels of training that will be required before people were given that kind of power. I worry about giving local authority officers particularly as liberally as this police powers, which my honourable friend seemed to be indicating, to try to relieve pressure on the The point I made earlier stands. The overwhelming majority of officers carries out their work diligently and appropriately. I'm sure we have come across examples, in fact I dealt with one in Bradford not too long ago who was a traffic warden in Bradford. I'm sure they are not unique to  I'm sure they must apply in other places as well. I worry about giving powers willy nilly to too many people without any appropriate safeguards.  Mr Deputy Speaker, but surely if some enforcement action is going to take place, the honourable gentleman will realise - and I think this is correct - that a police officer or someone in authority will have to be present? I take on board the point of my honourable friend. But I don't think that is the case. And that's one of the things about which I  I'm delighted Mr Deputy speaker to see the arrival of my honourable friend for North East  particularly as we are talking about the laws around seizure and giving council officers the authority to go around seizing people's goods. Because I know that he has shown, time and time again, that he's also nervous about these particular provisions in  It does come back to 16 (A) in this particular bill. I think my honourable friend for Christchurch was right to highlight  Everything flows on from this particular part of this particular clause, which is about reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an  And in terms of that  reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an offence is very difficult for anyone to fall foul of such loose wording when it comes to this particular part. It is not anything triefling Mr Deputy  We are talking about somebody going around seizing somebody's goods. It is quite a big power we are talking about here. I think there should be a higher test that has to be met before we authorise council officers to go around seizing people's goods. As my honourable friend said. It is not just any article that's been offered for sale, display or exposed for sale it. Goes beyond  It actually says in part B that it is any other article or thing of a similar nature that has been exposed for sale, which is in the possession of that particular  In effect, even if it isn't being offered for sale, they are still authorised to take those particular things away from the  too. And of course C applies - any recepticle or equipment being used by that person  They are quite wide-range powers of procedure we are in danger given to any employee of the  notwithstanding the levels of training my honourable friend assures us of. But they have those powers just on reasonable grounds of suspicion. I think there is a great danger there that on occasion that authority and that  maybe through frustration, or frustration, could be used by  if there aren't appropriate safeguards put in place. It actually says and I made this point in a bref intervention, Mr Deputy,  but I just within the to  -- brief intervention. It says "May only be seized if it may be required to be used in " It seems to me that that  on the face of it, when you read the legislation the first time  sounds as if that's quite a good safeguard. That in effect people won't be able seize things  but only for use in  but it just says "If it may be required to be used in evidence ""In essence there is no safeguard at all. Anything can be used on the basis that it may be used or need to be used in evidence. Who is to decide that? Of course the officers concerned who are seizing these goods and I wouldn't blame them for this, they are going to take a precautionary position. They are going ton within the it seize as much as possible because they don't want somebody further down the line to say - why did you leave them with that? That could have been crucial that bit of stuff there in evidence to prosecute this  I suspect that in this training that my My honourable says, I suspect what will probably be said to people - take as much as you can because it maybe absolutely  The bit you leave behind may be the crucial bit. I fear that  which seems to me is written to look as if it is a  is no safeguard  As my honourable friend from Christchurch says, when he it talks about reSeptembericals it,  cars, and any other kin of vehicle, for the purposes of this particular bill. I think there are some very serious concerns about the people who can seize products and also on the definition of when it is appropriate to seize  Then we come on to the return of seized articles. And, my honourable friend for Christchurch uncharacteristicically didn't really touch on this particular point but in 16 (B) subsection 4 it talks about the return of seized items where after 28 days any cost awarded by the court to the Corporation have not been paid. It seems to me that there are potentially condraictry things within the bill that don't really - - contradictory. On the one hand  that applies, where any costs awarded by the courts to the Corporation haven't been paid, it allow the City of London dispose of the products in anyway, in anyway the Corporation thinks fit. That is the first condition. Then it goes on to say that any sum obtained in excess of the costs shall be returned to the person. Well that's highly unlikely, given that they can dispose of them in anyway, shape or fofrplt but it also says they have a duty to secure the best-possible price that can reasonably be obtained. I can't reconcile how owned that the Corporation can dispose of it in anyway it sees fit and on the other  it is being asked to obtain the best-possible price for it. Those seem to me to be completely contradictory statements. And so, if we are basically saying that they've got to get the best pf possible price for these things -- best-possible price, it seems 4 (A) is redundant because that clearly can't possibly be the case. In terms of what is the best possible price to be reasonably be obtained  depends on how you get rid of  If you are selling it in a similar way to the person who was trading that has been seized, from you can get the full retail price. I'm not entirely sure how a Corporation fulfils its duty to secure the best-possible price for  What will it be expected to go through in order to fulfil that condition? Because it seems to me that in any - in the real world - lts not going to make any effort -- it's not going to make any effort to go out and sell it at the best-possible price. I'm grateful to my honourable friend for giving  He has been very generous with  It does concern me that is he not concerned as I am that the tragedy in this, once those goods are seized, the trader involved may well lose their livelihood as a result of the  Isn't that the real danger? Absolutely. That is indeed the danger, indeed. And particularly if the product are just going to be disposed of. Does he share my hope that our honourable friend, the member promoting this bill will intervene to perhaps explain that these goods will be sold in Petty coat Lane? I'm sure it'll be a very helpful intervention. I'm in the entirely sure he is able to give that  I don't think we should press him to do so. I think there are some anomalies like this in the Bill which make it unclear as to what is going to ha. We talked about vehicles that were being -- going to happen. We talked about vehicles being used. I don't within the to dwell on that. Safe to say where we are talking about people being prosecuted for a previous alleged owe fences, a previous alleged offence, -- previous alleged oi fence. But also that the vehicle was used in a previous alleged offence, we seem to be to be in very dangerous territory. It is clear from this particular clause that no offence ever needs to have been committed in order for things not to be returned back to  It just needs to have been alleged that these things were used in a previous offence. It seems to me that this is no basis upon which to take things away from people and refuse to return them and it seems to in the face of all natural justice and the British way being soft on crime. I draw a distinction between where a crime has been committed and where one has been alleged. The Bill doesn't draw distinction between those. Does my honourable friend think it would be helpful if the Mr W who signed the statement saying that this is compatible with the convention rights if he was to expand on why he believes these provisions are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights? My honourable friend makes a very good point. He made that point very well during his speech. I don't want to go on to just simply reiterate the point that my honourable friend made, but I think she absolutely right about that. I also worry about minor matters in the Bill in this section, where we are talking about still on the return of seized items, where it says that things will have to be returned to people. One is that if no procedures have been insurgented before expiry of 28 days, beginning with the date of seizure. As my honourable friend from Bury North  28 days can be a long time going without your goods if your livelihood depends on them. It would be a kick in the teeth if you weren't allowed to have your goods when no offence was being committed but was being pursued. White have a big impact on your livelihood. And it says diligent inquiry to ascertain that person's address. I'm not sure what the definition of a diligent inquiry is or how diligent a diligent inquiry needs  I fear that some of these provisions in this Bill will be used to give an excuse as to why certain things were not returned to their proper lawful owner. We should be minimising the opportunities of that not being the  It also says under 16C, and my honourable friend for Christchurch didn't mention this point but I think it is noteworthy, the court may order forfeiture of goods even if the value exceeds the Max yum penalty for the offence that's been committed -- maximum. It seems that we are levying a maximum penalty on the one hand but on the other hand saying if goods exceed that maximum penalty it account still be for fitted. I'm not sure on what basis it account be right or fair. Surely if there's a maximum personality that's the maximum personality. It seems that 16C4 flies in the face of what happens to be the maximum penalty. White interesting to have that particular point clarified. -- It would be interesting to have that particularly point larified. In terms of compensation, my honourable friend touched on the point that could be six months that people have to wait before this  That's in 16D1 B2. It again seems to me to be a lengthy period of time. It will only make an order for compensation, a court, if it is satisfied that the seizure was not lawful under section 16A. Which is why I very much hope that my honourable friend will go back to 16A on seizure about whether or not we can strengthen reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an offence. Otherwise the corporation will never ever have to pay compensation, however it acts. That can't be my honourable friend's intention. Surely it should be forced to pay compensation if it has acted in a way that's not becoming. We are in danger of getting them a completely get out of jail card for paying any compensation at all. I agree the points my honourable friend made on perishable items, Mr Deputy Speaker. I won't repeat the points that he made, because I thought he made them very well, despite the encouragement I'm being given on the benches on sit to extol the virtues a bit more about  Maybe I will under their provocation, Mr Deputy Speaker, THE SPEAKER: Maybe you won't! For now I will resist that  save to say that in - I'm trying to point out that my honourable friend missed that, but under subsection 5 it does again make the point that the corporation shall have a duty to secure the best possible price for these perishable goods. Which begs the question how are they going to go about obtaining the best possible price for these perishable goods? Are they going to set up their own market stall? I don't think that's going to happen. I wonder therefore why on earth this is in the Bill when it is pretty obvious that isn't going to happen. In  it actually says that it will be, that it will be disposed of the the person from whom it was seized fails to collect it within 48 hours of the seizure. Just because something is perishable doesn't mean it is going to go off in 48 hours. Why on earth we've only got 48 hours for all perishable goods irrespective of the time that good g could be used, I'm not sure. It seems to me that we are presuming that everything that is going be sold will go off in 48 hours. I hope that some thought will be given to twhoornt is appropriate or too draconian or totally inflexible. As we all know, perishable goods go off at different times. In terms of motor vehicles, Mr Deputy Speaker, where we have provisions there, I just wonder about where motor vehicles are seized as part of this seizure programme or ice cream vans as my honourable friend for Christchurch  I just wondered how this was going to work. As far as I could seekers and die be wrong. I hope my honourable friend may be able to help me here. It doesn't really cover where vehicles are  who is going to pay for the  the transportation away of the vehicle concerned, perhaps the storage of and the return O we all know that when the police seize vehicles where people for example are driving around without insurance and they stop people in street and they haven't got  and they confiscate the  They bring in a transport company to take it away and lock it up and supreme to pay a relesion charge to get the car back again.  if we are talking about seizing of motor vehicles and other  presume tpwhri corporation will have to go through the -- presumably the corporation will have to go through the same  It is not going to leave it where it was, as it is causing an obstruction and they will want  If the City of London Corporation are using these provisions to bring in a garage for example to tow it away and store it, a cost will bin Kurd. It is not entirely clear from the Bill -- will be incurred. It is not clear whether the cost will fall on the trader concerned, whether it will fall on the corporation. Whether or not parents shown that no offence was being committed, whether or not if it is incurred by the trade they are cost will be reimbursed by the corporation. I do stand to be  Mr Deputy Speaker, but when I read through this Bill, nowhere could I see all of these things made clear. I think it'd be helpful if we could have clarity on  otherwise we could be in the situation, it is bad enough having your vehicle seized if people can go on to demonstrate that no offence was committed. If you then have to pay to have it returned and you can't claim that  that's a further kick in the teeth. I hope my honourable friend will seek clarification on those points.  as my honourable friend for Christchurch said, seems to be a very sensible provision in the Bill in allowing businesses more freedom to trade outside their own  I would heartily endorse  But just this conclusion, I hope that my honourable friend accept the spirit in which the scrutiny of this Bill is intended  We intend to improve the Bill. I don't think there's been any attempt to wreck the Bill or to try and stop the Bill. The purpose is to try and improve the Bill. In this house we take seriously our job of protecting people's freedoms. And protecting them from unnecessary or overzealous regulation and legislation. With the Minister in his place, he's got a very good track record of trying to stop unnecessary regulation, unnecessary legislation and necessary bureaucracy. I hope that my honourable friend for City of London and Westminster will accept that my honourable friend for Christchurch and I are simply intending to stop consequences of  society achieved what my honourable friend would like it to achieve but doesn't do what we fear it may well do if it doesn't go unchecked. Speaker can I just  as I mentioned previously, the honourable member wasn't in at the beginning and I'm sure he would like to mention that to the House and speak briefly. Mr Deputy  I did make a comment earlier that I was watching from my  I apologise to the Member for cities of London and  whom I congratulate for bringing this Bill to the House  Die hesitate to speak and I will speak briefly.

I was attempted by the comments of the honourable gentleman for Christchurch who described the attitude of members on this side of the House as being hostile to the  There are that's not the case tonight and I'm standing to support my honourable friend on the front bench who is supporting the Bill.

A personal -- on a personal note, I'm a member of the honourable association of ship  I do not have the right to drive any sheep across the bridges. I'm an admirer of the history and heritage of the city corporation. I'm pleased to support the Bill and to correct the record on behalf of the honourable gentleman. We will get into it committee I hope and...

I bring in Mark Field. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank honourable members for this debate, some longer than others. I hope that they will feel that many of the points that were raised I was able to deal with in the debate. Clearly one hope this is gets to committee  we will take on board a number of concerns brought into  In particular to the relation of the European services directive. This is still an ongoing concern. I was glad to see the honourable gentleman was on my side on this matter and on the side of the corporation as we will endeavour to ensure that the provisions are compatible with EU law and hopeful along the lines of the legal judgment that we've had had from leading counsel on this matter.S I thanks the Member for popular and  He makes a -- Poplar and  The City of London is the only area that retain as business vote. We have local elections in the next month. It is fair to say that the City takes seriously its responsibilities beyond the Square Mile and in particular has great pride in the work it does in the London borough of Tower Hamlets and in Newham and Hackney and in Islington. These are on the City fringe. We all benefit as lopdzers from the phenomenal work that's done in West Ham -- as Londoners from the upon the nal work that's done, and our -- the phenomenal work that's done. It is applies to west Wickham common as well. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not detain the House. I very much hope that we can move towards second reading of this important bit of legislation, it will not make a huge amount of difference but there are some great benefits not just for the City of London but many  businesses and the huge number of visitors will derive from this Bill once it becomes lerks and I hope it will do so relatively  THE SPEAKER:The ayes have I beg that the Bill be read for a  I do so on behalf of honourable members and we have been united in this Bill and it seems to have attracted interest across other parts of the country and we welcome and we look forward to hoardes of visitors thanks to the honourable member for Christchurch highlighting this Bill, people visiting our area and else where. I want to say a couple of words as to why we jointly across the Humber and across political parties, believe this to be necessary. We have run a long cross-party, cross- estuary campaign, to get action on our very high tolls on the Humber Bridge and this was successful, as we know with a grant from the Chancellor of £150 million to enable the tolls to be halved, which has had a huge impact on the numbers coosing the bridge at the Choosing the bridge. I want to pay tribute to the minister and former Secretary of State for The work they did in making this happen. We are indited for their efts and hard  -- indebted. For their efforts and hard work. Without their personal involvement I'm not sure we would have seen the works  There are a number of changes and I want to explain their detail and necessity. Somebody said to me a bridge is a bridge that was built on the back of a 1950s bill, constructed in the 1970 and opened in the 1980s. Indeed I was three when it opened and my honourable friend for Cleethorpes, we worked out was nine when the original Bill on which the bridge was constructed  going back to 1959, actually passed this House.  for some considerable time the bridge has been constructed and those who visited the building will appreciate this, in an almost  Has been like stepping back in time. We used to have 22 members from the various local members serving on the Bridge Board. I declare an interest as a former member of the Bridge Board. I wasn't one of the 22 memberss I was one of the 22 reserve members, so we had 44 potential members of the Humber Bridge Board representing the four local authorities until the region and indeed different local authorities at that time, it has to be said. So it was a very unwieldy institution. This Bill will formally reduce that down to  And also to add on to two members of the private sector, we we all believe is absolutely necessary to give the bridge a new look and drive. They will be drawn from the business community. There is provision in this Bill to allow for their reasonable expenses. I think this may have caused some concern to so. I want to assure members that the four members of the local authorities will continue to draw their expenses from attending the bridge for the local authority remuneration scheme and there is no intention at all to draw any salaries or additional expenses from the Humber Bridge board but this is necessary for the out of pocket expenses for the two private sector members for them to be able to reclaim their Travelex Spences which they can't do at the  -- their travel expenses. There is no intent direct to salaries for local authority  I will give way. I'm grateful for that particular point  Seems that under clause 5, "The board may pay to each director of  such allowances and expenses that the board may from time to time determine." I'm not sure that there is a great deal of restraint imposed on them in this particular Bill. Perhaps he might able to help us out there.Thank  It is absolutely necessary to allow - and obviously all members of the board will be created equal. It is absolutely necessary to enable the private sector members to get their out of pocket expenses  But of course local authority members continue to be remunerated through local Government schemes by local authorities. They are, at the end of the day, elected representatives. So, if they did come forward with any proposal it try to draw salary out of this, one would expect a backlash at the  Another important change here is the sharing of the burden upon the four local  The bridge, arguably, you could say is more of an advantage to people on the South Bank of the Humber but at present 98% of the liability for the debt lies on the city of Hull. That's bus of how it was construbgtd. The four local authorities have agree - - constructed. The four local authorities have agreed to share that burden equally. There were protracted negotiations involving particularly one local authority which we have overcome and all local authorities are now in agreement that the bridge is of importance to all authorities equally and consequently that burden should be shared equally. The Bill also allows the bridge Board to actually - and I hasten to  given the political beliefs of some of my colleagues who are in the Chamber but at present it is not possible for any traffic enforcement on the Humber  It was described to me recently you could drive through the tolls at 100 miles per hour, naked on a motor bike and certainly not be committing any traffic offences nomt. Of course we can't have those kind of saeflt issues not being addressed. -- safety  Not that many people do but people who do not pay the toll cannot be persued and the speed limit that is not enforceable. I'm grateful to my honourable friend for giving way. Is it a case that there is a problem with boy racers from Cleethorpes going along the bridge and that is been known for a Member of Parliament to be speeding? I won't be drawn down the line but I understand the person who holds the record could be somebody who will be well-known  but I won't name that. It is nobody in this House, I have to  but it is important, however that that change takes place. The Chamber would also allow some flexibility to the Bridge Brd there. Isn't flexibility on the Bridge Board if they wish to give dispensation for tolls. This is an important point for those representing the South Bank. Over the last decade or so, health services and other services have increasingly been concentrated on the North bank. Certain cancer treatments and heart treatments are offered in the city of Hull. It is not possible at present for any dispensation on tolls to be given to cancer or cardiac presents who have to travel regularly to the North Bank for treatment. They are not allowed to do that at present. One outrage - one - the situation that causes outrage locally is that the families of people who wish to go and visit prisoners on the North Bank can get their toll paid for by the Home Office. Job seekers can go the support through job centre plus but health patients can't. It is for the Bridge Board to decide whether or not they wish to exercise such a discretion, although they've indicated that they are sympathetic to that for certain types of patients who require regular treatment on the other side of the river. I just would end by saying saying As I said at the start, this has been a cross-party campaign to modernise the bridge. We feel that the current structure is very rigid. It doesn't give the bridge Board the freedoms that it requires commercially., that we would wish to see it have and consequently this change is absolutely necessary. I will give way. Co-just clarify, because there seems to be - the maximum toll on the Bill can't be increased by the Board but it can  I would wonder if he could talk through a bit what it'll men in the few toor for tolls on  Whether or not the Board can increase them above the current level or what or what are the implications for people more widely? Of course I can. The current situation with the tolls is they can be raised to £3 overnight that's the order in place by the Secretary of State. So they could be returned back to £3 overnight, without any consultation with the  We've had, in the past - the situation as it stands at present is that a toll inquiry will be held at great cost to the Board, at regular intervals at which local  including myself and many of the faces in the Chamber today, trot up and to argue passionately against any raise in the tolls, often on social or economic grounds.  of course the Bridge Board's primary responsibility and function is and will remain, repaying the  So those arguments are completely irrelevant. So huge sums of money are spent at the moment, when there has been this demand for inyiery and granted by the Secretary of State. And river time the recommendation from the inspector has been that the tolls must be raised. What this will do, is it will allow the Bridge Board to raise the tolls in line with RPI should they wish, although I will hasten to add that the Bridge Board has said it expects to hold the 50, so in actual fact a real-terms cut for the next years  So the charade we had before didn't gift public any real  It was a process that was gone  at which there was a lot of debate and hot air generated but if he end of the day, the fundamental situation came down to the Bridge Board's finances and every bridge rise was always  with the exception of  when a minister intervened. I  Thank you. Does the honourable gentleman mean that once  the cost of the bridge has been repaid, the toll will substantially reduce or disappear? Well we may all, Mr Deputy Speaker be dead and buried by the time that  I include myself in that. But the situation, of course, is that the freedoms in here would allow the Bridge Board to refinance in the way it can't do at the moment but it would be for the Bridge Bored to determine what they wish to do with the Bridge. They may within the it raise money for a replacement Bridge. At some point I'm assured it'll run out of  Returning to the issue of  the situation, if this Bill goes through, will be that the Bridge Brd will be entitled to raise the tolls in line with RPimt. -- Bridge Board. They've established as part of the users  and business groups, to engage the public on any  The situation will be different to where we are at the moment where the primary focus will be - are the Bridge Board's finances sound, can they repay the debt? Their number one legal responsibility. And that is done through the tolls, as always bb. It is not done at the general expense to the taxpayer. We have paid for the bridge four times over, and still owe £150 or so million. The situation on tolls is really going to be unchanged other than we won't have to go through this potential charade of an inquiry at which there is no discretion at the end of the so with those few words, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would say this is a Bill on which we are all in  We all supported this campaign for a very longered period  And already having the tolls halved has had a huge impact  THE SPEAKER:The question is that the Bill be read a second  To emphasise that this is  cross-Humber, I pay tribute to the work of the honourable members.

Now with the local enterprise partnership, with an emphasis on localism, we are determined to make that work. We've done an awful lot of that, in terms of having the bridge tolls, that's very important, but unless we set up a new structure, with 22  reduced to four local authority members, including all the local authorities, bus one of them wasn't included previously under the current structure. -- because one of them.
