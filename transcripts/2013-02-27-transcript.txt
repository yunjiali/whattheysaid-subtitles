That morning. The party leaders are back to face each other over the dispatch box. Shortly after Prime Minister's Questions Stark, there is a debate led by Plaid Cymru and the SNP on changes on the housing benefit and the under occupancy  That will be followed by a discussion on the financial services sector. Join me for around up of the day at 11pm tonight. -- for an round-up of the day. The first question is from Labour today, concerning the policies on the Order! Questions to the Secretary of State for Wales. Number one. Before answering the question I would like to wish the House for next Friday a very happy St David's  With permission I will answer questions 1, 3, 5 and 11. The government has committed to delivering the plan that has cut the deficit by a quarter and given us record low interest rates and records the number of jobs, benefiting families and businesses  Moody's decision to downgrade the bond rating is a reminder of how important it is to fix the problems rather than simply bored or more.What is good for the economy of North Wales is good for  and what is bad for that economy hearts as, too. With 1204 to more people in long-term employment in North Wales than a year ago does not give me hope for the economy of my constituency. What is the Secretary of State going to do about this? She is entirely right, the economies of North Wales and Merseyside are inextricably linked. The government has created more jobs since it has come to power. The rate of employment has increased by 1.6%, but what I would say is that she should bear in mind that the Welsh Assembly government is responsible in Wales for economic development and it needs to closely align its policies with those that the government is pursuing. Will the Secretary of State admit that his economic policies are de Sade does disastrously failing? His new jobs are a mirage. Part-timers seeking full-time work, temporary workers wanted a proper job, that is what the figures illustrate. There are breadwinners struggling to put food on the table and heat their homes, contributing to 200,000 children living in poverty and Wales. Why does he not apologise for this? -- in Wales? I will not take questions from the right honourable gentleman his party was responsible for the oversight of the trashing of the  and responsible for the mess we are having to clear up. As  this government has created more than one million private sector job since it came to  That is something we are The loss of the triple-A status as a stark reminder of how important it is to develop sensible policies to fix the economy. If I could remind the honourable gentleman back Moody's recognises that the UK's creditworthiness remains extremely high and point to the strong track record for fiscal consolidation, were it not for that we would be on negative outlook rather than on stable. I am glad to see the Secretary of State is reading from a script today, no doubt they are not trusted him to make off-the-cuff comments again.  what -- can I ask him what light will be like after April, for the families who will lose the  bank to his government, who are giving the money to millionaires? -- banks. After April there will be many more families in Wales who will be benefiting from historically high levels of employment and lower taxes. Indeed, if I could remain the Honourable Lady that since we came to power, 1 million fewer people in Wales are paying less tax and 190,000 are paying no tax at all.What recent assessment has my right honourable friend undertaken in relation to prospects for the Welsh house building industry? It is extremely important in Wales and as a major driver of economic recovery. I was therefore disappointed to read today the comments of Steve Morgan, the chairman of retro plc -- Redrow, who says that it is particularly catastrophic for the industry, with 000 being added to the cost of  This cannot be right. I would consequently urge the Wells government -- Welsh government to align its policies are.

No coalition policy has greater economic impact on Wales than increasing the spending power were through raising tax-free allowances. Can my Honourable Friend tell us exactly how many people have been raised out of paying tax in Wales over the last two years by the coalition? As I have just mentioned, 1.1 million people in Wales were being less tax as a consequence of the policies pursued by the government, and 000 are paying no tax at all. That must be good news.The Welsh economy benefits from students from developing countries attending our excellent universities. Following the Prime Minister's visit to India, will the Secretary of State join with our universities to tell the students from India, China and Malaysia universities are open and we would welcome them to study your? -- to study here? It is a major export earner, and the Prime Minister made it clear that there was no limit on the students who can study here, provided they have the necessary qualifications and speak the language. Last week, a Foundation warned that Wales faces a decade of destitution as a result of the policies being pursued by this Government, while the Welsh government said that �600 million was being taken out of the pockets of ordinary Welsh people. Is the Secretary of State telling the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues what people are paying about his government in Wales or is he just cheerleading for policies hammering his country? I would say that if this Government were to pursue the policies advocated by the party of visit, -- party  to simply borrow more, then applied to those individuals that the honourable gentleman mentions would be worse. We are providing 100,000 additional jobs for the people of Wales, reducing their tax bills, doing our very best to ensure that they get sustainable private sector jobs. The honourable gentleman has no answer to that. Number two.I will answer questions to, and so than  We have regular discussions with the Department of Work and Pensions on the roll-out of Universal Credit to insure it is  Minister for work recently told me there will be no big bang effect on the finances of housing associations and landlords, but Moody's has placed them on downgrade review, and the NHS is warning of increases in rent  When will he get a grip before devastating impact across Wales? I do not accept that. We are in very close discussions and consultation with housing associations, local authorities across Wales, and the fact is that we expect 200,000 households and Wales to see an increase in their average entitlement of �160 per month as a result of the Universal  Seven in 10 people will lose out on the bedroom tax. Councils have been stretched to the  and will not be concerned that vital services will be cut as well as large numbers of homelessness increasing? I would make the same point, we simply do not accept these catastrophic scenarios that the members of the party opposite are trying to communicate about. -- about this. The Universal Credit will be a major tool in creating new incentives to work, raising employment levels in Wales, and do not forget that the legacy to Wales was too many people who have not worked at all. Many people do not know of the children will lose their free school meal entitlement, and some families in Wales will be better off not seeking more work because they would have to earn an additional �1,500 per child to make up for the loss of school meals. What is he doing to safeguard for the school meal entitlement for children? -- free school meals? She is is unimportant. And we take seriously concerns about child care  Regarding free school meals, we are in close discussions with wealth ministers about this -- Welsh ministers about this. The government has demonstrated its commitment to super-fast broadband by providing �150 million across the UK to fund super connected cities including Cardiff and  Almost �57 million to the Belgian government to ensure broadband access is available to homes and businesses in the heart  -- to the Welsh Will he introduce a facility that will not leave behind This government has allocated 500 and the �2 million to stimulate commercial -- Commercial Investment or broadband in rural communities and �150 million to improve mobile create a new cloud over Swansea, a  Will the minister meet with me and the council to discuss about the superconnectivity, so that the sun continues to shine? May I commend Swansea for their wonderful win in the League Cup final? The honourable gentleman knows that I'm always happy to meet with him and if he would like to contact my office, I will be pleased to do so. This Government's commitment to broadband, does the Secretary of State share my bewilderment and many of my farmers in the ked ked constituency, that the -- Ceredigion constituency, that there won't be initiatives for two years on broadband? It's good to see my honourable friend sticking up for Ceredigion on Ceredigion Day. Yes, I'm bound to say that the choice of areas for the first roll-out was something that a number of colleagues have commented on. Sufficient feist it  the delivery is keeping a close watch on the way this is developing and I'll speak to them about this very issue. Many of us had the great joy at the weekend of watching the triumph of Swansea on  Can he assure that the future triumphs of Newport County and Cardiff City and Wrexham will be available on broadband? Yes,  Particularly, Wrexham, which at the moment is top of the Blue Square league. I had meetings with ministers and the Welsh Government on a wide range of  including justice and law  although these issues are not devolved. I'm grateful to the minister. In fact, I'll wish him happy St David's Day, not today. Can I just make the point that there's an all-Wales legal circuit for excellent police forces and all-Wales Probation Trust and it's high time we devolve justice and policing to Wales. He'll know there is a huge clamour of enthusiasm for this move and I hope he will join  Mr Speaker, I understand that Plaid Cymru has already made its submission to the Silk Commission, which will no doubt consider the proposals and will be reporting in spring next year, but what I would say is this Government has already shown its commitment to devolution of policing by the creation of the Office and Police and Crime  It brings it as close to the public. I have to disagree, that the Commissioners is nothing  Can I just take him back to the obvious point, laws in Wales now are diverging quite naturally from those in England. In terms of administrative law, in terms of family law, in terms of criminal law and others. It's high time for the legislature in Wales to have its own system, otherwise it will probably be the only one in the world without such a system. I hear the point that the right honourable gentleman makes and know doubt the Commission will take it into account in deciding whether that should be taken forward. The Welsh Assembly may be able to prevent parents have having their children educated in England or patients being treated by the excellent English NHS, but they won't be able to stop criminals crossing the border and breaking the law in England. Does he agree that it would be a disaster to devolve policing and justice to the Welsh Government? My friend has made his point in his customary restrained manner and no doubt the Commission is listening very carefully to what he has to say. He has 48 hours in which to make his submissions and I would encourage him to do so. In his discussions with Welsh ministers, has my right honourable friend had an opportunity to look at the costs and implications of a separate legal jurisdiction in Wales and could he tell the House whether he favours such separation?Tempted though I am, I will not second guess the work of the Commission, but I would say is the UK Government will make its own submission to the Commission this week and it will be published next  I have discussed this issue with my right honourable friend, the Minister of State for defence, personnel and I was pleased to support him when we debated this topic in Westminster Hall last  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Wales punches above its weight in recruitment to the armed forces. But Government outsourcing means that half its careers officers are going to be closed in Wales.

I thank my friend for his response and I warmly welcome the possibility of a so-called superprison in North  but does he agree with me that further public sector investment in North Wales should not detract from the need to rebalance the Welsh economy and ensure we move away from the dependency on public sector pay in Wales?

Authorities in Wales need roughly 550 new couples in Wales to volunteer to be foster  Is it not a lewd rust own goal to include potential foster families in the bedroom tax? Before members opposite start complaining about the term bedroom tax, I heard the Prime Minister use the word.

They are con fusing tax and deficits and spent 13 years describing out-of- control public spending as  I agree with the point made by the honourable member from Cardiff South on 5th February when he said that people who suffer with O-level maths struggle to make competent decisions.The honourable lady's question has been grouped. Her moment is now. We should hear  I'll take the moment. One immediate measure to protect the most vulnerable people is to exempt those on disability living allowance from this tax.

How can it possibly lie in the mouth of those who changed the law on housing benefit for those in the private, rented sector to complain when we do it and extend the same provisions for those on housing benefit in social housing? Have I missed something here or... My right honourable friend highlights the total incoherence in the Labour Party position on this very well.  the justification for maintaining a subsidy for spare rooms is even harder to justify in the conditions that we are in, where we have to reduce the deficit and restore financial budgetary discipline to the country. Can I draw the House's attention to the motion this afternoon and encourage honourable and right honourable members to join in and to join us in the lobbies. The ministers for the DWP has told me there have been no assessments of the flex built of the housing market in rural Wales in order to respond to the tax. Has he made any assessments?The fact  Mr Speaker, that there are different types of housing stock right throughout Wales, but the one problem that does face the whole of our country and Wales is the problem of overcrowding and long waiting lists. It cannot be justifiable that at the same time that people are receiving housing benefit for spare rooms, that in the same street as them, in the  there are houses with  four bedrooms and four children in the same bedroom. How on earth can the minister defend a policy that is unfair, unworkable and will penalise the disabled, forces families and foster parents  Does he deny that his own Government's impact assessment shows that Wales will be harder hit than anywhere else in the UK. Is there not a single issue when he and the Secretary of State will stand up for Wales. I just say to the honourable gentleman, look, there's nothing caring or compassionate or progressive about walking away from our responsibility to fix the deficit and the debt. If we don't do that the very people that we hurt in the future are the poor and the vulnerable and the very people that we all came into politics to defend. Wales office ministers will undertake a range of visits to attractions to celebrate Wales Tourism Week and raise awareness of the industry's vital importance to the Welsh economy.Thank you. Hospitality is a vital part, so will he welcome the ten by Hotel School and the next time he's there will he pay us a visit? I welcome that question and the next time I'll be in the area will be this  because he and I have the privilege and pleasure of representing the most beautiful part of the United Kingdom and I very much welcome the new development that he has been able  That will be a major boost to the tourism industry not just in Pembrokeshire, but across We are ready. Let's get  Questions to the Prime Enact the 1984, when the Brighton bomb went off, I felt a surge of excitement at the nearness of Margaret Thatcher's demise, and yet a disappointment that such a chance had been missed. Those are the words of the Labour candidate in Eastleigh by-election. They are a complete disgrace and I hope the leader of the Labour Party will get up and condemn them right now.  three years ago the Prime Minister had this to say, the first priority of any government has got to be keeping UK plc's credit rating, that has got to come  It is the only responsible  Can the Prime Minister  how was that going?  isn't it amazing that the leader of the opposition will not condemn someone who apparently speaks up for terrorists? It isn't it absolutely disgraceful? He will have a second chance when he gets  But the decision of the ratings agency is a reminder of the debt and deficit problem that this country faces, and frankly it is a warning to anyone who thinks we can walk away from it. It is absolutely vital that we continue with the work of this government, that has cut the deficit by a quarter, has a million extra private sector jobs and interest rates at record low  I know it is still his policy to address excessive borrowing by borrowing more.

And he is borrowing �212 billion more than he planned because of his failure to grow the economy. Let's turn to the reasons for the downgrade.

When will he admit that we should never listen to someone who sold the Gold, who bossed the banks, who racked up the deficit and can't say sorry for any of it?

Does the Prime Minister have the same confidence in England winning the Triple Crown as his Chancellor had in retaining the AAA credit rating? And as team manager, does he intend to change his economic team to avoid further humiliation and a triple dip recession? There is a difficult record with prime ministers endorsing various rugby or football teams, so I won't plan  but I am very proud of the fact that on St David's Day the Welsh flag will be flying above Downing Street, as it should be, and when it comes to the rugby, may the best team win.

It is right to raise this issue and I am sure there will be support right across the House of Commons for those who do parts in the Arctic convoys and all those who served in Bomber Command. It is not enough to have the excellent memorial to those who served in Bomber Command in Green Park, it is right that we have the medal for Arctic convoy and the class four Bomber Command.

Would he ignore the poor advice from the party opposite? The British economy has been through difficult times, not least because we are recovering from a massive boom and bust, a massive banking bust and the deepest recession since the 1930s. In terms of employment, in terms of new business creation, you can see an economy that's rebalancing and it's that rebalancing and that business growth that we need to  The Prime Minister has stood idly by while hard-pressed families across the country have faced soaring energy bills, now over �1400 a year.

We are legislating to make sure that energy companies put people on to the lowest tariffs. When that Bill comes in front of the House of Commons, I hope she will vote for it. Will the Prime Minister withdraw the National Health Service procurement patient choice and competition regulations that seem to contradict assurances given in the other place that this coalition Government will not privatise our NHS? I would urge my honourable friend to look very closely at these regulations because I think what he will find is they are absolutely in line with the principles the last Government put in place and actually, the effect of withdrawing the regulations would actually mean that you have more competition in  rather than managed  managed by monitor. I think the effect of what he wants could be the exact opposite of what he seeks. The Energy Secretary, the Deputy Prime Minister, the committee on climate change, the chair of the energy and climate change Select Committee and a group of over 35 businesses NGOs and faith groups are among those who back the inclusion of a target to decarbonise the power sector by 2030 in the Energy Bill. Can the Prime Minister explain why his Government have failed to include such a target in the Bill? We don't believe it makes sense to consider setting a target range for 2030 in advance of setting the 5th carbon budget which covers the period. It will be taking the power in the Energy Bill but setting it in advance wouldn't make sense. In  Labour commissioned three reports into the state of the NHS to celebrate its 60th birthday  We now know those reports were damming and raised issues such as a dangerous target culture that was raised five years later. Those reports were suppressed by the Labour Government. Had they not been suppressed thousands of lives could possibly have been saved. Will the Prime Minister join me in calling for an investigation as to who exactly was responsible for suppressing those reports? I know what my honourable friend has said and I will look carefully at the issue she raises. The whole point about the Frances Report is we should use this opportunity to say  of course we support the NHS and its founding principles, but not everything in the NHS is right. Where there is bad practice and where there are things going wrong, we need to shine a very bright light at that and make sure not only that we deal with it, but we also hold people to account for it,  Further to the honourable member's question on the new regulations laid down on 13th  the Government gave assurances that GP Commissioners would not be forced to put health service at competitive tendering. The regulations go completely against this. What is the Prime Minister's excuse for this? The GP Commissioners are not forced to put services out to competitive tender. It's GP Commissioners and the point is it is going to be doctors making the decisions about whether they want to expand choice and diversity  But I would say to the honourable lady, what is she worried about, what's the Labour Party worried about? Isn't it the case that there are lots of voluntary bodies, charities, the hospice movement, organisations  like Whizz Kids in Tower Hamlets that provide an amazing service for wheurpb with -- children with wheelchairs. Let us have diversity, let us have choice, make sure we are on the side of Two-and-a-half years ago, a nine-year-old from Glamorgan became the 9th person to die in a river incident on a rafting exercise on a river. There appeared to be blatant disregard to common sense health and safety standards. Her parents have campaigned tirelessly for a criminal investigation, improved standards and even funded witnesses to travel to the Turkish courts but their efforts have been frustrated for what appears to be bureaucratic  Will the Prime Minister work with the Turkish authorities to gain justice and help warn people of the risks of white water rafting in Turkey? He is right to raise this tragic case of a nine- year-old constituent of his who died in 2010 in Turkey. I want to send my sincere condolences to the family in these terrible circumstances. I know he's been speaking to the Minister for Europe Europe regarding this. Our Embassy in Turkey is monitoring the case and can approach the Turkish authorities and ask them to keep the family fully informed of any progress and I am sure the Foreign Office will have listened carefully what what what he said today, standing up for this family's  I have a vulnerable constituent, near pension age, who's lived in the same house his  His parents have now  He is willing to be rehoused but cannot find an alternative. He now faces homelessness because he simply can't afford the Government's bedroom tax. Can the Prime Minister explain why he has prioritised a tax cut for millionaires whilst devastating the lives of vulnerable people? The point Wye make is there are 250,000 families who live in overcrowded accommodation. There are 386,000 people who live in underoccupied  There are 1.8 million people who would love to have a council house who couldn't get one. Of course we need to build more social homes and we are doing exactly that. But in the meantime, we should do everything to make sure those homes are used in the most efficient and  that's what these changes will help to achieve. That's why they deserve our support. We were all hugely inspired by the wonderful Paralympic Games in London last year. Not only a triumph for sport, but a triumph for perceptions of disability. Will the Prime Minister welcome the generation-inspired report which is going to be presented to Downing Street today, as a great opportunity to use the legacy of this to improve the lives of young disabled people? I will certainly welcome the report my honourable friend mentioned.

If there are no more points of order we come to the Ten Minute rule Motion. I beg leave to bring in a Bill to acquire the Government to publish a list of powers of local councils and a code of conduct defining the degree of autonomy attached to those powers and areas where a council may act autonomously to create a mechanism to identify and adjudicate on breaches of the code by local or central government and for connected purposes. Given where we are with the parliamentary timetable, you would have to be wholly ignorant or real optimistic to assume the Bill I am were posing stands any chance whatsoever of becoming law this  Although I am as a Lib Dem  by necessity, with boundless reserves of cheery  I have no expectation of seeing it mature into legislation.  so confident am I of seeing it strangled at birth. I thought of calling it the Local Government and Futile Measures Bill only to realise that the additional phrase probably applied to much of the legislation in this place.  I am far from disheartened. These events, apart from seeming a piece of seemingly British eccentric constitutional indulgence or useful occupational therapy for backbenchers, can have the affect of putting or keeping on the agenda important key themes. My last foray in this role was an attempt to introduce a Bill to enhance or provide democratic accountability for NHS services. The Government has gone on and done this. I would like to think my proposals offered a more elegant, less-expensive and less complex solution than that contrived by the Government in the Health and Social Care Act.  Mr Speaker, is based on the supremacy of Parliament. My current proposal draws attention to the fraught relationship between local and central government. Parliament, Brussels notwithstanding has unfettered  what Lord hall sham preferred to as undictated...

The liberation of local by central government often resembles Stalin's post-war invasion of Eastern Europe. They are allowed discretion to decide how to implement unpopular policies and therefore share or deflect the blame but central Government retains all rights to interfere in any area, at will, with little or any notice. Whoever  it doesn't matter. It isn't a party political point I'm making it is not in the DNA of central Government to give away power that doesn't matter. You can understand Ylocal Government deals with huge areas of national  education, social care,  the environment, the economic vitality of communities and ministers simply can't be uninterested in what local government does or how they in fact do it.  therefore, they keep in  quite understandably a range of powers, regulations and incentives to influence how local government actually performs.

As he himself says, he takes  But presumably only to  how little power local government has and how it can be  changed or denatured by the whim of Whitehall. Taking  Mr Speaker, is not necessarily a good thing. And my Bill seeks to mitigate that.

It can be done, fully taking into account national needs, with or without consensus. But it having  it having been defined separate spears of action, the rules of the gairges everyone sticks to them with an appeal to a judicial or quasi judicial body when that understanding is breached by either party or, if for that matter it is ridden rough-shod over to suit the mood, whoever holds the reins of central or local go.

And in fact, having to make clear - but it is not doing  is wholly to the good it.

I'm following what I have been told, but the honourable gentleman is displacing a self-afacing modesty, with which he isn't always  but he is playing second fiddle today. Dr Amy Thank you. In a few weeks' time, Government's underoccupancy penalty or bedroom tax is said to come into effect. It's going to cut the housing benefit of an estimated 660,000 low-income households by an average  or over £700,000 for tenants who are deemed to be living in a home bigger than their needs. It's cause anxiety and anger in equal measure and it follows hard on the heels to cuts to tax credits which have slashed the budgets of families and compounds the real- term cuts to the safety net of social protection for those people unable to work because of sickness or disability or those who are unemployed or underemployed by economic circumstances well beyond their control. This bedroom tax is a further assault on the precarious finances of the people who are already bearing the brunt of the Government's austerity measures.  that as we have seen this  are not working. The penalty is inherently unfair and unworkable. When we debated this issue in Westminster Hall in a debate led by the honourable member for Sedgefield a few weeks ago, not a single backbench MP from the Government benches rose to defend this policy. It's deeply disappointing that they were so thin on the ground today. I can only assume that too many MPs have been lured by the charms of eastly, but I'm not really -- Eastleigh, but I'm not surprised that they are reluctant and I'll give way. I'm  Can the - does honourable lady see that there is justification for treating tenants on social housing any differently from tenants on benefit in the private sector? The last government introduced exactly the same changes for tenants on housing benefit in  rented sector and did the party or Plaid Cymru object or raise a debate or object when those changes were made to tenants on housing benefit in that sector and if they didn't do so, why not and what is the logical justification for opposing these changes today? I think the honourable gentleman has exposed at this early stage one of the big red herrings in this debate, that the private, rented sector is comparable to the social, rented  We already spend significantly more supporting people in the private, rented sector than we do people who live in socially rented accommodation, which is significantly cheaper.

I feel a little bit sorry for whoever keeps his correspondence in check, because the DWP's own equality impact assessment shows that two thirds of the households affected by the bedroom tax are the home of someone with a disability. That is recognised within the terms of the  66% of them - I will give way. Further in those who might be writing to Dave, there will be a higher proportion from people who will have nowhere to go with this with this unfair tax that will do for the Conservative Party what the poll tax did for the Conservative The honourable gentleman makes a very important point about the difference impact between rural and urban areas.

Of  I'll give way.Thank you. Is she aware of the petition to the Scottish Government that it put forward by a law centre which would amend section 16 of the Housing Scotland Act to ensure that people who have been subjected to the bedroom tax would not be evicted due to those arrears? I'm aware of that and I do intend to turn to the specifics of the situation for social landlords and some of the specifics relating to Scotland later on in the discussions. Last  the Chief Executive of seven charities Carers UK, and others Contact A Family, the MS Society and Macmillan Cancer Support wrote to the Chancellor asking him to exempt carers and disabled people from the tax in recognition of the contribution carers already make and in order to protect them from further financial hardship. In  the Secretary of State said he would look again at the impact on the policy of disabled  but having considered the whole disproportionate impact, he is ploughing on regardless. It's  it's reckless, it will cause untold distress and hardship and the Government really needs to  Would she accept that when you have two million households on waiting lists in England alone and 250,000 families living in overcrowded come decision that is simply unfair for people who live in houses largeler than  -- larger than their needs?

That will do absolutely nothing to resolve the underlying problems, which I think we all know are related to the supply of affordable housing. I'll  I'm grateful. I congratulate the choice of the day for this debate for discussion. Would she agree, however, that one of the problems is that there is a complete mismatch between the stock for housing associations and council houses that councils have and what people need and that there simply aren't enough properties for people to move into? She is absolutely right. It's absolutely at the core of this issue, but before I turn to that issue I would like to say a bit more about the issues facing disabled people and I'll give way to the honourable  I thank the honourable  She has been generous. I've been listening very carefully to what she has been saying about those living in social housing, but what does she say to the 2,000 people on waiting lists in Reading hoping to get into social housing? I would say to you, that perhaps those people in Reading might like to look north of the border where building social housing would be the long-term solution to tackling the lack of affordable housing. Can I say that you don't solve this problem by taking housing away from one needy group and giving it to another needy group. Given what I've already said about the disproportionate impact on disabled people and that most of the people affected by this policy are already among the most disadvantaged in our  it seems to me that - and I won't give way - but can I  that the real challenge for local authorities is how they house people who are likely to be on very low incomes and if people who are older, people who are suffering ill-health are moved out of the homes, that creates another headache and will push people into more expensive, private, rented accommodation. I'm keen to make  I'll come back later. If I can return to the point made by these respected charities, one of which I used to work for, I think they make a very compelling case that exposes just how socially distructive and counterproductive this tax will be for disabled people and families. The Government's stated objectives for the penalty include getting tenants to move to smaller homes. Moving house it stressful and expensive for everyone, even when it's a welcome move. How much hor stressful and difficult must it be -- more stressful and difficult must it be for disabled people?

I'm grateful for the honourable lady  She is right to say  She is right to say also heartless. The Prime Minister is wrong to hide behind the figure leaf of the special fund. There will be more than half of those affected on DLA without any sort of support at all. I agree with the honourable gentleman. He's making a very important point. I have no doubt as well that in some cases the penalties will jeopardise the arrangement that unpaid family carers have made to allow them to care for a loved one in their own Thank you. Is she also aware of the situation where people are in a home that has been adapted for specific needs and is now too large, but they may be forced to move out and it may be a social landlord has to pay to adapt another house for their needs? Is this not a daft way to proceed? It's utterly daft. I've seen cases in my own constituency where relatively minor changes to local support services have disstabilised the balancing act of families providing care with work and family and I've met far too many people who are already at the end of their own endurance, compromising their own health and well-being in order to care. When carers can't cope any more or their health break downs, the human cost is large and the financial cost both in terms of primary healthcare spending and the need for expensive care packages is high. I'm grateful to her for giving way. Since this policy will lead to greater homelessness and evictions which are not only massively painful but  will she agree that the policy isn't cruel, but massively counterproductive, just another attack from Government on the poor? I don't just think that it's counterproductive, but also just not thought through. Some of the challenges - I will give way to the honourable gentleman. I'm grateful on that very point. She is making a really good speech here and has support from this side of the House across the benches. It is thought through in my view, Mr Speaker and it's thought through because it's not about fitting people in with housing and in terms of the housing  but it's not about underoccupation, but it's about cutting people's benefits and making sure that people have to pay the difference. The Government know that people will have to pay the The honourable gentleman is right. In Scotland we estimate there are 000 homes affected by the bedroom tax that have adaptations made. We have been told by the Government, repeatedly, there is an extra £50 million in discretionry housing payments allocated to local authorities intended to adapt homes so people don't have to move. I will give way  Let's do the sums. The additional allocation amounts to only 6% of the total short fall across the UK. In Scotland it is a paltry 4% of the short fall. What this means is even if Scotland's entire discretionry housing  not just the extra bit but the entire housing allocation was focused solely on those disabled people, living in adapted  would not even then cover the GP in tenants' incomes left by the bedroom tax. -- gap. It is a shameless attempt to penalise physically disables people and asking them to carry the can for this dog's breakfast. I'm grateful to my honourable friend who is making a fantastic speech. Doesn't she think it is appalling that this architect of this pernicious tax, the Secretary of State,s is not  He is leaving it to the  He should be here. He should be on his feet speaking in this debate trying to defend that. Why is he doing that?

Landlords in the private sector may also be less than happy about new adaptations being made to their  whether it is handrails,  stairlifts or bathroom alterations. Again, what an unnecessary waste for public money. At times local authorities are struggling to meet demand. I'm gritful to the honourable lady for  Would she agree with me that the kogs of private rentals, compared to social rentals. Is now not the time in Scotland to regulate private rentals so we don't start subsidising landlords which is the root of the increase in housing benefit. It is clear that we'll have to control it so we  for example problems like in London. A lot of the problems have been fuelled by the vast overinflation of the London rental markets in the south-east. I think it is also important that we remember that some of the disabled people bs subject to the bedroom  are the same people losing their Disability Living Allowance, when it becomes a personal independence payment or seeing their support significantly reduced. Some may be losing their employment support allowance, especially if it is time limited, and yet they are all still going to have to deal with the same impairment or long- term health condition that they had before and they'll still face the same physical, economic, attitudinal and communication barriers when they attempt to access the labour market and get on with daily lives. The Government to date has paid no heed to the come lative impact of these measures on disabled people, acluem lative impact that will have disastrous consequences for disabled people. Can I draw the honourable lady back to the fundamental based principles. I'm listening to the speech with  It goes to one fundamental point that the architects of this motion do not address: is it accepted that the housing benefit Bill, which is rising in these times, needs to come down? Yes, or no? The reason that the housing benefit bill is so high is because we have had a recession which has pushed people out of employment. I think it's one of the very trite suggestions that we have had repeatedly from the  in trying to defend the indefensible, with this tax, is people should pick up a few extra hours' work here or there, to meet the gap in the bedroom tax.

I will give way to the honourable  Has it occurred to her, during her excellent speech, that not one single member on the Government benches has, in anyway, criticised the bedroom tax? Doesn't this reflect so well, the manner in which this Government is conducting  against the most vulnerable people in our society? The honourable gentleman is right. As I said earlier it is disappointing that there are not more people here to debate this  And more people here to defend the Government's policy. Where are the Liberals? I will give way. I thank the honourable lady for giving way and applaud the strength with which she is setting out the case for those people who are going to be the victims of this drive-by hit on the housing benefit budget. Throughout the UK. But does she recognise in the context of Northern Ireland, there is an added complication, because a measure that is sending a message to people - you shouldn't be moving there, you should move. In the circumstances of difficulties in Northern Ireland, that's fundamentally unsettling not just of individual communities but of community relations. As ever, the honourable gentleman makes a powerful and important point. This hasn't been thought through on different shal impacts on part of the UK and Northern Ireland deserves a great deal more adenges. -- differential. And deserves a great deal more attention. I can see your colleague. I thank the honourable lady for giving way and congratulate the honourable member for bringing forward this very timely motion, along with her  Further to the points made by honourable friend, the member for Foyle, could I advise the honourable lady to underscore that particular point and it deepen those divisions, the minister for social development in Northern Ireland handed back £15 Moyle yon in the last monitoring round, rather than ensuring that that be invested in the provision of new build social housing, which contrasted with my party, when we held that portfolio?The honourable lady makes an important point. It is helpful that the Secretary of State is here to hear that point and I hope it'll rotate that back and note the implications for Northern Ireland. Mr Speaker, I'm keen to move on and look at the implications for another set of people who are likely to be adversely impacted by the bedroom  And those are foster carers. Foster carers are not routinely included in housing needs assessments and the allowance paid to foster carers to cover the cost of meeting a child's needs does not include any component for housing  The Government expects local authorities to support foster carers out of the heavily- subscribed housing payments pot. But as we have seen that won't cover the pregs feeds of disabled people in specially-adapted homes. Foster carers do an important and difficult job. Children requiring foster care almost by definition have been through traumatic experience and are more likely to require more intensive need and  And fost it is insisted foster carers don't take on other work o outside the home. -- and foster carers and moreover they don't receive a fee. The fostering network is afraid that this tax will exacerbate the increasing difficulties for foster parents. Given there is a shortage, the Government needs to work how this will work in practice. I thank my honourable friend who is making a powerful case. On Monday evening we debated the Children and Families  In that Bill there are good things about speeding up and streamlining adoption. One of the points raised there, is unless the fostering section is looked after, then the whole thing will collapse.  we see this thing has in the been properly thought out. The honourable gentleman makes a timely point, given the debates that were ongoing in the House earlier in the week. I will give way. I'm very grateful. The honourable lady is making a wonderful speech on the dreadful bedroom tax. I wonder if I can take her to another group of caring people, wenwhen people break up, access agrements are made by the court -- agreements. They are made on the fact that they are having an extra bedroom. This Government is saying - find the money for the extra bedroom or lose your children. The honourable gentleman makes a goo point. Families break up are difficult situations for people to resolve. We know the cost of children growing up without a parent can be considerable both in social terms, but in terms of the impact on the individual whose been separated from a parent and the fact that this legislation will make a more difficult for non-resident parents to stay in touch and maintain proper contact with their children is rep rehence I will. -- reprehensible. Would the honourable member agree, because of variations in unemployment rates, because of the variations in composition of the housing stock, because of characteristics of tenants varying from area to area and other considerations that have been made by other members, that this should be an issue of local discretion, based upon local conditions, and then only phased in, matched by a programme of social house building? I'm quite sure the honourable gentleman will want it make a speech setting out the case for that in due course later this  Personally I would of course like to see decision-making. That includes decision-making over the budgets for these policies devolved to the Scottish Parliament  In terms of what works well for England, I look forward it hearing his contribution this  I will give way one more time and then I must get on. I'm grateful to the honourable lady. Will she use her elegance to use her influence with the Scottish her influence with the Scottish I am coming on to that and I want to look at some structural issues in just a moment. Before I do, I want to mention pensioner. They have been exincluded from the under-occupancy rules. It is very important to say this, many older people who are tech nick under- occupying are anxious and are worried that it'll force them to  It is important that we make it clear at this stage they won't have to do so. But once Universial Credit is introduced people of pension age with a younger partner of working age will be forced to the bedroom tax and will be made to move into smaller homes. It is a great human cost for older couples. I won't give way. I want to make progress. I want to turn to the structural issues that we are facing. Amidst all the soundbites we have heard about spare bedrooms, what has been missing from the debate about the bedroom tax all along is the failure to acknowledge the underlying shortage right across, in the supply of affordable housing. What what is fundamentally unworkable is the mis-match of the housing available and the needs of  The scale of the problem varies across the UK but in ask the land only 26% of homes available for social rent are one bed-roomed  Yet 60% of the tenants affected by this measure would require a one-bedroom home. In  according to the National Housing Federation there are twice as many occupying two bedroom homes than the number of one bedroom properties that became available. No matter how we shuffle people around there are not enough homes of the right size available for affordable rent. This much is entirely outside the control of  yet they are being punished for a structural problem that is none of their making. I will give way to the honourable gentleman. The honourable lady is being most  I'm most grateful. Would  it is important in this  to ensure that the facts are clear and that in the previous Labour Government, building of houses was at its lowest level since the 1920s and that in the ten years before this Government came  social housing cost has doubled. And does she accept that that simply is a system that cannot snn abdicate previous other governments regarding the housing talking about below market value sales to tenants who are buying them. That underpins the whole shortage supply and I don't think that members on the Government benches can pass by responsibility for having created the problem in the first place. Housing in the social, rented sector is the cheapest option for people on low incomes. In my constituency you can rent a three bedroom council house more cheaply than most one-bedroom flats. It's important to recognise that the people in such houses have limited choice about where they live and what sort of house or size of house is offered to them. Councils and housing associations already go to great lengths to match tenants, but they simply don't have enough one- bedroom properties to go around. Many councils allocate homes on a points-based system as it's the most fair approach, but most require flexibility in terms of  location and type of property by the tenants. Demand exceeds  Anyone who knocks back the offer of a house that is two bedrooms simply may not get another  People cannot be picky and have to take what is made available. I absolutely agree with the points that she is putting to the  Is she aware that 83% of this Government's cuts have been passed directly to councils by the Scottish Government and it's councils who are having to deal with the sharp end of this problem? Does she understand that that is the amount of money that has been taken out of Scottish councils at this time? My colleagues from Wales are saying in Wales the Labour Government's passed on 100%. Surely, in Scotland it's better that the Scottish Government is trying to mitigate the impact of those cuts on councils rather than passing them on? That's wholesale. What we also have to remember, to come back to the point on social housing, we have to remember that most was built when people had larger families and different housing needs and that the housing that's there simply doesn't match the demographics that we have now. The great irony of the bedroom tax is it won't save any money. Already, it costs more on average to house people on low incomes in the private sector than it costs to house them in the social sector. This is a point I made earlier on. The average benefit payment in the  rented sector was £80.71. In the private sector it was 35. I think it's also fair so say that the rent paid to social landlords is re-invested back into social housing, which is better value for money for all. All the tax will cause upheavel and distress and expense to people who are on low incomes, and those battling health problems. While the mismatch between the housing stock and tenants' needs is the glaring flaw in this policy. The penalties will bring serious consequences for social landlords who depend on the steady flows of rents to help their  I've repeatedly - I want to make a point first - raised issues relating to impact of welfare we form on social landlords with ministers, but today they've repeatedly failed to sake seriously the concerns of associations and others about the impact of this tax and the shift to universal credits.  in response to a question from the member from Glasgow North, the underSecretary of State for Scotland said he had met with providers in Scotland was satisfied the concerns of housing associations and local authorities.  the convention of local authorities and the housing associations have written to the underSecretary of State making it abundantly clear they are not satisfied and their concerns have in no way been as waged. --  The President of the association have made it clear that they are deep concerns about the  These key stakeholders recognise that this tax penalises people on lower incomes and they are concerned that there are no are concerned that there are no finances should tenants fall into  I will give way. She is quite right to point out that the mismatch is between the housing stock and the need. However, many people who are building houses in the private and social sector and building elsewhere are building larger houses because economically that makes more sense than one  so I'm wondering what the Scottish Government is doing to encourage house builders in Scotland to build one-bedroom properties in order to address this mismatch? The honourable lady makes a very good point about the practicalities of building one- bedroom houses against two. In terms of the Government Government's record on building  19% of the houses built in the UK in the last five years have been built in Scotland. The Scottish Government is committed and has built 34,000 affordable homes since it came to power and when I think of the lack of effort that was made in the past, I think it's important to bring that up. The point made from the honourable lady is an important one is about the balance of properties and  It's very important, but the real solution to this is not changing the number of bedrooms, but scrapping this altogether. The honourable gentleman makes a very fundamental point today. I'm particularly pleased there are so many Scottish MPs here today. That's to contribute to the debate and I hope take part later. 82% of Scottish MPs didn't vote for this measure and we are in opposition. I'm delighted to give one way to one of the small minority of Scottish MPs who did vote for this. That's correct. What she has said and puzzles me is why was she unable to persuade half of her Parliamentary colleagues to turn up on a Wednesday afternoon and vote against this? I'm afraid the honourable gentlemen makes a really spurious point and given the record of his constituents and the impact that this will have on his constituents, he would be better sticking to the real issue, which is this won't work and it will harm people across Scotland. In terms of - I think it's worth talking about. THE SPEAKER: Joorbgs I hope it's a point of order and not frustration. The honourable member shouted across the chamber that I voted for the regulations, is it in order for me to put the record straight that I voted against the regulations, unlike the honourable member who didn't turn up? Whether it's in order or not, the honourable gentleman has just done it.Thank  Mr Speaker. I think the fundamental opposition to the bedroom tax is something that we can all unite in and I would urge members across the House to look at the problems here and work to address them. In terms of mitigating the impact of the tax, I think there are a number of things that we can and should do. For  the Scottish Government has already moved to strengthen protections for tenants against eviction for rent arrears. The new action measures that came into force in August will make sure that eviction is an absolute last resort and tenants will have access to advice and every opportunity to agree a repayment plan that's affordable to them and reasonable for the landlord. I think we should also look very carefully - I won't give way - looking carefully at the loopholes in the regulations.  the meaning of bedroom is not very clearly defined in the  I heard yesterday of one large housing association in  the Knowsley Housing Trust, which has reclassified 600 properties in order to protect  Obviously, that comes at a cost to the housing association, but I think it's nevertheless a brave and socially responsible move. I'm sure that social landlords are also looking very seriously at breaking -- bricking up windows or taking down walls. Others in England have called for two-bedroom properties to be exempted. They argue it makes no sense to build one-bedroom homes, because they want to encourage long-term tenants who are integrated in the community, not transient short-term tenancies. Another potential mitigation measures is for housing associations to co-ordinate lists and transfer those most effectively like we have seen in Merseyside. Obviously they won't work so well in rural areas, but it might help  There is a change -- range of options and we need to look closely. This returns to a point that was made earlier, a question posed earlier, I think social landlords need to be consist tent in how they deal with arrears. I'm not sure we can draw a divinction between someone who falls into arrears because of the bedroom tax and someone who is not underoccupying, but falls into arrears because their ESA has been cut or tax credits have been reduced or lost thiver job -- they've -- they're job or fallen  This will cause resentment between many people. There will be increases in rent across the board if budgets are under stress. She is making a very good point, but if she looks at what is proposed to amend section 16, that may help people in current tenancies to avoid eviction, which would be a  but what it will not do is extinguish the debt which can be chased by other means through bank accounts or wages. We know from the  how many years after it died were people still being pursued by the councils for arrears? His legal expertise helps him make a very compelling point. I know that social landlords are aware that more people will be aware and they're proactive in trying to prevent it happening, but they are also clear that their ability to provide affordable homes depends on their ability to collect rents from tenants. The real problem is the underoccupancy penalties are unworkable and instead of trying to mitigate them, we should change the underlying problems and abandoning this tax. In Scotland, clearly we have an opportunity to do that by bringing decision-making powers back to the  Housing associations have been stable and they've been able to borrow money at competitive  The Chief Executive of the S  has pointed out that it's harder to borrow from banks.

I think the honourable gentleman makes a good point and some associations are already have to contend with that. If housing associations are to continue to invest in existing properties and continue to build a  smaller property, we need to meet our changing demographics, then they need to borrow cheaply. Any increase to the cost can only have a pressure on rents and service charges, pressures that fall back on the low-income households that can ill afford them and that live in the sector. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the problems for social  caused by the short falls in housing benefit for people affected by the penalty will be further compounded by the indirect payments under unveerstal credit. I won't give way. -- unversal credit. I won't give way. This tax is unnecessary. The underoccupancy penalty is men festly unfair. It puts disabled people on low incomes right on the front of their austerity agenda and it asks people on the lowest incomes to pay the price for the structural problems affecting the supply of affording housing -- affordable housing, but it's unworkable. Instead of addressing the problems, it undermines the responsibility of social landlords to invest and it fails to tackle excessive private sector rents in London which have fuelled inflation in the Bill. The Secretary of State needs to get a  The bedroom tax won't save any money, but it will cause chaos for tenants and social landlords alike. Untold distress also for those who are forced to leave homes and communities or find themselves in debt. It's not too late for the Government to think again and I would urge ministers today to reconsider.

Look again at whether it is reasonable to consider two-bedroom Is it respectful to this House for the Secretary of State to be playing with his telephone, even for a second, or playing on his phone?

Which make clear if this policy works and encourages people to downside there will be no  Which of the two objectives does he support? Saving money or encouraging downsizing? The honourable lady is not correct in saying that. There will be a range of responses we'll run through later, to this change. Some people will stay where they are and will pay the short fall. Some people will use the share room for a lodger or sub-letting, some people will work, or work more hours and some people will mo. Our impact assessment does a range of modelling to the way people will respond but clearly includes people straying where they are, and paying the short fall that's where the saving comes from. Point of order. A minute ago the minister stood up and said these were Labour cuts. Can I seek your advice and clarification as to who is in Government? THE SPEAKER: It is not a point of order but you have got your point on the record. Minister? The minister has been generous in giving way early in his contribution. But can this Liberal Democrat minister honestly say, when he comes to the Despatch Box, that it is fair to throw disabled people out of their house for his bedroom tax while giving millionaires £2,000 extra a week. On the tax treatment of the wealthy, I understand Britain's millionaires are a demanding return to the days of Labour when they paid 40% top  not 45% and when they paid 14% on capital gains tax, not  I give way. Would he accept that one of the central themes of this reform is also to bring fairness into the system? That it cannot be right to have 250,000 people living in overcrowded accommodation, whilst there are lots of people out there, who have surplus accommodation?

I'm grateful for the minister giving I way and the comments on  I notice in the Conservative leaflets in Eastleigh, he said it is fairness in the welfare system that would make things fairer. But is he 100% sure today that measure will deliver the savings set out by the Chancellor, yes or no? Mr Deputy Speaker our impact assessment is a best  Obviously it is a best estimate based on what we expect the impact of the policy to be, that's all any Government department produces. I believe it is a robust best estimate. My friend knows his Liberal Democrat colleagues did express concern about this measure when it went through this House and the other House and it was changed as a result of some of those concerns, but does he accept that there are still concerns that the messages as to the facts are not getting  some pensioners are worried? But, also, that there are  such as those with disbeabilities, those who have to be having separate rooms, those with teenage or university children and with service children, who I hope he will still address because I don't believe their needs are being adequately met so far SNP  Mr Deputy Speaker, my right honourable friend has some credibility on the issue of bell  He's been prepared to vote for difficult decisions on public spending.

I will say more in my remarks about how we want to ensure that that system works. I thank my honourable friend very much for giving way. Does he agree that the question, which both the proposer of the motion, which she wouldn't allow me to ask, and the  must actually ask is: do they support any restrictions, whatsoever on the size and accommodation for social tenants or the amount of housing benefit? Do they support either of those in anyway form whatsoever? Indeed. We know that the housing benefit bill doubled in a decade, 50% up in real terms and nothing was done by the party opposite to tackle this. We were essentially, particularly in - in a moment - with a collapse in house-building under the last  it is not surprising that private rents soared and housing benefit bills soared. I'm happy to give way. I'm gritful to the minister. I know he doesn't want to deliberately mislead the House so I know it'll correct the record and say it was Labour who introduced housing allowance and limits on housing benefit and he will acknowledge, too, in our manifesto we set out plans for a cap on benefits, including housing  I think that's very  The right honourable gentleman and his party were in office for 13 years, and decided in their 2010 manifesto - that was the manifesto he was referring to, to do something to control housing  In office they don't do  but when they are heading out of Government, they choose to do  I give way to his honourable friend. Could he explain to his honourable friend, the member for Southwark that MoD officers have admitted that Armed Forces families could be affected, some will be affected by this change and why does he think that prisoners should have an exemption, the families of prisoners should be exempted and not Armed Forces the armed forces is unaffected. One bedroom and the standard is  Young serviceman or woman living in barracks,  Many personnel who live with parents not affected. Young  living in social accommodation, not affected. We are narrowing down the number of people we are talking to to probably a  very small number of people.  let me explain to the honourable lady that when a young serviceman or woman leaves social accommodation, where the parents are on house be benefit, their housing benefit goes up. It goes up. If she knows it, I don't know why she raises the question. What  the young person on a wage is deemed to be making a substantial contribution to the rent of the household, say £70 or  When they've been away for 13  that deduction doesn't apply, so the benefit will go up. There will be a charge for under-  which might be £14 or something a week. The young person instead of paying £70 to the household costs doesn't have to pay anything to the household housing  so if they value that room  they can still pay £2 a day to mum and dad and be over £50 a week better off. In fact, rather than seeing mum and dad's benefits fall, they'll see it  We've dealt with that  Moving on, there are - perhaps if I make a little more  The issue about the private sector tenants and the relative position of social house  we spend more housing benefit on social housing tenants than we do on private sector tenants and we pay for the subsidy for the rent, so it's quite wrong to say we subsidise private tenants more than we do social housing  But what we do, do, if someone is in private, rented accommodation, broadly speaking we don't allow them an extra bedroom. Why is it fair to have a street with two houses next door to each  one of which is privately  one is socially rented, where we give a spare bedroom to the person on social accommodation, which is benefiting from better rent and we don't give it to the  rented accommodation?Why doesn't he tell the House the full  Department has lost its case in the Court of Appeal and it's plcy of discriminating against disabled people and not giving -- policy of discriminating against disabled people and not giving way, has been struck down by the courts.

I want to address this point. I'll say more in a moment, about the specific way we'll address the position of disabled people, because it's an important issue. Roughly two thirds of all social tenants have a DDA based on the measure used on the impact assessment. That's a similar proportion of those affected. It's not disproportionate. If you take the stock of tenants, around two thirds of people are in that group and that's true of our specific  He will know from the lengthy correspondence I have had with his colleague Lord Freud of my concerns particularly in regard to very remote and rural areas, of which there are quite a considerable number in my constituency.

I can assure people, that we have said that we will do is undertake a rolling two-year research programme into the impact of these and other changes and the impact on rural households will be one of the factors to look at. Wales and Scotland are included in the scope of that research. One of the things that we are very happy to look at is for example the allocation of discessionary housing payments. -- discretionary housing payments. I'll give way. He's going to research the impact of that, regardless to what it will do to people in the meantime. It's  And the suggestion that we have transition, means we end up with this at the end of the day. It's ridiculous.That was helpful. You can't research the impact of a policy that hasn't happened. We are implementing the change which is designed to save half a billion a year and we have heard nothing about where people would find that  but what we have said we'll do is as the policy is implemented being we'll research and look at the implementation, because there are things to change going along and one is the allocation of discretionary housing  I'm grateful. As you know, I believe that this policy could be made to work if people were offered an alternative before the penalty  but people in remote  the nearest might be on the mainland or 20 or 30 miles away in my constituency. Could he look at the formula for allocating discretionary housing payments to councils to put in a rural factor so councils in the Highlands and islands get more because of the problems? He's very welcome to join our honourable friend in this conversation that I'm looking  but he raises important  They have credibility, because they've been willing to take difficult decisions on public  whereas the party opposite have said no to everything, and disowning both their responsibility for the deficit and any willingness to say where it would come from. I want to make a little progress, as I haven't turned past page one of my remarks and the House would like to hear from a few other people. The cost of housing benefit increased in real terms by 50% in a decade. £23  Given that we have said we would ring-fence the state pension, if we looking at people of working  you cannot look at housing benefit if we are looking at saving  For social sector tenants the bill totalled £14 billion. That is why we have had to look at this area of spending. Now, the system of tenants in the private sector has already been tightened in a number of ways. I think there's a fundamental fairness issue here, which is to say is it right to squeeze private sector tenants' housing benefit and make no change in the social sector, where rents are subsidised and people already have an advantage? That is what we are trying to do. In terms of the scale of what we are talking about, we at the moment have a spare bedroom subsidy. We subsidise one million spare bedrooms in social tenants through housing benefit. At  we have a situation where two households next door to each other can be treated  We heard talk from the honourable lady about fairness. We have to be fair. Those living in social sector benefit from a subsidised rent. Should they benefit from a subs dieded spare room? When we have one million spare bedrooms and 250,000 people in overcrowded accommodation, we must do better. We have to regard the spare bedrooms of the social housing stock as a precious resource that we can make better What can he say to people who do wish to go down from larger homes to smaller homes, but they simply do not exist or they do not exist in an area like mine, which is largely rural. They exist in the communities in which they currently live and they could be offered another home many miles a from where they have grown up and where they work and have their friends. It's ridiculous.Just to stress, there will be a range of responses to the underoccupation charge. Some people will move, but some people who are in work and one in six of the households we are talking about  so there are options for people who are in work. There are people who could take work and people often say there are no jobs. There are more people working in this country than in the whole of human history, so it's important - approaching 30 million people in work in this country - so for some people it will be working or working more hours and it will be an option for some. Let me address  before he replies to my reply, which is there has to be better use of the social housing stock and I pay tribute to the housing associations in the Liverpool area, 20 of which have come together along with local authorities to pool the stock.

It will be very difficult for people to make  so in effect they are -- their choices are limited. Many will be forced to move by financial necessity when this comes in.

Some people in the social housing sector will do the same thing. In my constituency the choice is between staying put in a two-bedroom property, of which there is a spur lust, or moving to a one-bedroom property which is in the private sector. That costs more, so how is this a saving? I think it's a common misconception that there's a one-way flow of people. If someone moves from social property to the private sector as  that frees up a socially rented accommodation. Into which someone who is previously perhaps in overcrowded accommodation, temporary accommodation, B&amp;B accommodation, moves in. There will be flows in both directions. We have taken account of those sorts of moves in our estimates of the  Will he not recognise that the largest single driver for the increase is rent increases? It's not just private, but in England it's the social and affordable sector because of the policies of his colleagues in the Communities and Local Government Department, who are pushing higher rents up. If a tenant moves out of a secure council tenancy, into a new, affordable rent tenancy it will be at a higher rent and if they're on benefit the bill will rise. This counterproductive. Why is he doing this? I know that the right honourable gentleman is very knowledgeable about housing matters and he will know that the period of the last Labour Government was not a good one when it came to building affordable homes, which is part of Members opposite who left us with a  My honourable friend is right much these are Labour's cuts because of Labour's deficit. Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me make more progress and I will give way  We recognise that this is a time for change that will present challenges for tenants and for landlords and we have to support  One of the positive things out of the change is local authority tenants and social housing tenants, their landlords getting to know them far better than in the past. All too often housing associations didn't know their tenants well enough and there has been an important process of getting to know the individual tenants and their needs. As a result of which - as a result of  for example, Some of the more creative housing associations have found schemes where half a dozen people move accommodations so there is a better fit. This is a precious resource to vulnerable people in our communities and I will not have it said that those who stand up for the vulnerable are on this side of the House. We are on this side of the House. We want those bedrooms filled. I'm very grateful. Wouldn't it be better than a approximatelycy of evicting people because their children grow up, to offer them cash incentives to move to smaller housing as I did as leader of  on Croydon Council, when we offered them cash incentives by moving rather than evicting him. THE SPEAKER: I don't know who the minister had given way to. He got it the right one, as it were. We are all in favour of incentives to make better use of the housing  I welcome any measures he took to that effect. But they haven't worked. We have 1 million spare bedrooms for people on housing benefit. They have not worked on the scale... They haven't worked on the scale, on the scale that is necessary. I have given way three times to the right honourable  I want to make further  Before I do, I haven't given way to the honourable lady. The minister seems to be hell bent on introducing this policy. Can he perhaps protect some people? I think he accepts there will be people who will not be able to move because there will not be suitable property and they will not be able to afford the short fall. They will fall into housing, rent arrears and could find themselves being evicted. At that stage they become intentionally homeless, and end up being at the bottom of any housing  Will the minister look at that and see if there is he can do to ensure someone in that position is not seemed as intentionally homeless because of that housing debt and therefore, would never stand of chance of getting social housing again? I'm grateful to the honourable lady. The point of the policy is not for people to be  which raises a whole not only cost for the individual but also cost for the exchequer. That's not the point of the exercise. We are trying it make sure the housing stock that is there is fully  Where somebody has a  Let me address this  There were two ways we could have approached this: one was blanket exemptions, and that's what we did for pensioners and I'm grateful to the honourable lady for moving the debate making it clear that people who are pensions are not covered by this change. -- pensioners. There is clearly another set of people where we wanted to protect them. Let me give an example of foster children, that was mentioned. The position of foster families, I sthi shared across the House. If people need a spare bedroom for a foster child, we want to make sure we have one and support people who are fosterers. The question whether it is done by blanket exception or whether as we have done, we've costed what it would take to meet the short fall for those families and given it to local authorities so that a foster family for whom that is an issue and it may not be  can approach that local authority and have the short fall  We, my right honourable friend and I are open to have a discussion about whether that was' the most effective way of delivering that support. Our judgment was disdiscretionry housing payments would give local authorities the discretion we want  If that isn't getting through or causing an zits for foster families who don't know about DHP ors if local authorities haven't communicated well enough, we're happy tolike at whether that's the most effective way. Where there is a short fall, disregsry housing payments are  and -- discretionry housing payments are available. And we want to use those where they are  I'm really grateful. That  I want to pursue the question from the honourable lady from Aberdeen. The minister said whether he was willing to look at whether disregsry funds could meet certain problems or not. -- discretionry. Can I take it he can look also at the categories of who is defined as needing a bedroom could be looked at, so that categories where I think they ought to be counted, in but currently  might be included? I can see the attraction of that approach. There is a billion on that, I think. The attraction of that approach, for example, in foster families would be that you define the size criteria and added to the list of a  teenage children and so on, you say a bedroom used for a foster child is a bedroom, therefore no deduction applies and you doipbt have to go to the council for D HPs. And DWP meets the challenge. The 458 eng is defining in Whitehall all the categories of people who ought to have a room. -- the  Even where there might be foster carers for whom this is less or more of an issue. It may vary from case-to-case, the judgment we have to make is where we make a blanket exception or where we say we give local authorities money and discretion. Each argument has attractions. I will reply to the point. What we have to make sure is the money we have given to local authorities is  That people know it is  For example, I have been interviewed on various television programmes and they featured case studies of people who were obviously distressed and I don't doubt people are distressed by this  who obviously, if they approached their local authority, would nobt affected. And -- would not be affected. That's the issue. They would go to their local authority. The local authority has been given money to help them and would help them and they wouldn't be affected. He and the honourable lady is right. We have to make sure people are not unduly alarmed by this, because in  there is money to help the most vulnerable. I give way to my honourable friend and then the honourable gentleman. I thank my honourable friend for giving way. Can I ask him, does he think the guidance given to local authorities, as to how they should target the discretionry fund and the discretionry housing payments, has been sufficient? I think my honourable friend raises an important point. We've allocated funds to local authorities with two particular groups in mind - foster families and where there has been a substantial adaptation to a the  because moving someone somewhere else and adapting again isn't a good use of public funds. We have endicated that to local authorities. I do agree, webl probably do more and will be doing more to make sure local authorities are aware of the needs of those  -- we will be doing more. Will he confirm the total amount of money available in digs cessionary funds to Wales will be £6.1 million and the Welsh Government last week estimated the total cost to Wales in the bedroom tax at £25 million? Does he concede there is a significant short fall, or is he proposing to increase the amount of money to Wales and the rest of the country where the short fall will also apply? Well, the reason I started my remarks by talking about deficit reduction is that this measure is intended to save money. Short fall he refers to is the saving to the exchequer. If we  we don't save any money. We might as well not do the policy. I have to say, if Wales is getting one-fifth of the short fall it is doing exceptionally well, relative to the rest of the country, I have to say.  Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to come back further and respond to the Chir of the Select Committee, who raised an important point about those who are unintentionally  -- the Chair. Whilst it is for local authorities tow make decisions on homelessness applications as they do now, under current statutory homelessness legislation, if the only vn something outside their control, they should not be considered intentionally homeless by the local  I can put that on the  I hope that is clear. Will he also confirges he says Wales is doing -- confirm. He says Wales is doing well. His own impact assessment demonstrates in black and white 46% of claimants will be affected in Wales, vrsts a UK average of 31%. -- verses a UK  Does he want to reconsider his remarks that Wales is doing well out of the bedroom tax.The impact of ending the spareroom subsidy that we currently pay is the average loss in Wales is below the national average it is £12 a  against £14. The same as  They have below average  He asks about the size of discretionry housing payments? To  across trias a whole we've allocated £-- across the country as a whole. We've allocated £30 million on top of the £20 million that local authorities already get in DHPs so, there is £50 million in DHPs available to local authorities in all. So, £00 million of savings, £30 million on top of the £20 local authorities  If Wales are getting a bigger proportion of that, they are getting a bigger proportion of the  I will make some progress and then very happy to respond further. We have engaged actively with a range of advice organisations, including the chartered institute  to develop guidance for social landlords. We have already come across many examples of social landlords working with tenants to prepare for this change. But we do recognise that there will be particular individuals who face issues and this is why, on top of the £20 million of DHPs local authorities already get, we've allocated an extra £30 million, giving them a total of £50 million available to help people affected by the policy. The two groups I have mentioned are those disabled people in significantly adapted accommodation and foster carers, including those need to retain an extra room when they are between fostering placements. I believe this should be able to help around 000 foster carers and around 000 wheelchair houses where houses have been adapted. Now there has been some discussion of the position of disabled people and obviously the definition of disability used in our impact assessment is a self-assessment, based on a household survey. Of the people affected by this policy, less than one-third are receiving disability living allowance, so the majority aren't receiving DLA. We have also touched on the position of service personnel. I think I have given reassurances to the House about that. I'm happy to give  Before the haub gentleman leaves disability, he has made it - - the honourable gentleman, he has made it clear he is looking at the discretionary housing payment last week the BBC was reporting that the Secretary of State had instructed officials to look into the definition of disability and the way the bedroom tax would be applied to disability. Is the minister saying that the Secretary of State was wrong and that no instruction was been given to officials? Or is he detracting from what the Secretary of State said?  we keep this and all policiesnd constant review. We are looking at whether the use of the DHP to target vulnerable groups which I think is what the whole House wants to us do is being effective in protects the people we within the  We are continuing to  to ensure it achieves what we want. Bearing in mind what the minister said about DLV. Will he then today agree to exempt people on DLA from this bedroom snacks how the Prime Minister possibly say that he is putting disabled first, without doing that?  at the risk of straying on to other legislation, we have, for  when we have had it make Dee difficult decisions which she of course opposed on benefit rates, specifically exempted DLA and attendance allowance as a sign of our support to disabled people. She will underthat this is a measure partly about reducing the deficit, partly about making better use of the housing stock. Receipt of DLA is not synonymous with needing a spare bedroom. If somebody needs that they can approach the local authority and we have given them find but a blanket exemption of people on DLA isn't correlated with needing another bedroom. As it was announced last year, these measures will be monitored and evaluaited over a two-year period from April. Initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report in  it will it will include - this evaluation will..., yes, yes. Further to that last point in relation to the disabled person in a bungalow or a house they'll have to try to advocate. Account minister confirm what criteria would be used for the person to justify a spare bedroom? A doctor's note to say they are disabled and need a bedroom of their own? Is that the criteria the Government What we'd said is that if someone has a particular need, they approached the local authority, who has discretion. So there is no set white water of and raw. In individual can approach their local authority who can judge whether this is a house in particular need who they can help. There is no rigid blueprint. The whole point is to give local authorities the discretion to meet the needs if they think that is a priority. Thank you for pointing out it is for discretion. Actually, I think it stands for draconian. He is trying to give the sense that people don't need to worry because they can just go get this extra  But the amount of extra money is a pittance in comparison to the amount that is needed. This is an ideological attack on social  An astonishing suggestion, trying to get rid of social housing. We have built more affordable housing in the past year than in the prior 10 under Labour. I entirely understand that the honourable lady opposes everything, but it is not a credible option for a credible government. The research we will be undertaking involves small scale research with a range of local authorities, social landlords and a voluntary organisations, it will look at supply issues and people unable to share rooms. Where possible, it will also consider the effect on vulnerable individuals and family  picking up on the. The honourable lady made. -- the point. Can you explain to his government why he is taking to court situations where a disabled child is unable to share with his sibling?There is a limit to what I can say what these cases are in  We have been given permission to appeal to the Supreme  We are Uplyme the current ruling and we have issued local authority guidance on how to treat  That is a case in flux at the moment, I don't want to say  What we're trying to do through this policy, and this sums up what we're trying to achieve a - we're trying to tackle a massive structural deficit. We have taken action on public sector pay with little support from the opposition, and also on benefits. We have protected the state pension. When we're trying to find £12 billion from public spending, housing benefit is one of the biggest working-age benefits. We have to look at the social sector. The most valuable way we can look at social sector housing benefit costs is to look at the millions of spare bedrooms we currently subsidised and ask if that is their to the people who don't get that subsidy. -- that is fair.Thank you. I think most people on this side of the House will have been pretty disappointed by this minister this  Ferrar range of important arguments that have been put this afternoon and there have been no answers whatsoever. Mr  I want to start by it congratulating the Green Party and the SNP for using their time this afternoon to table this motion. We support this motion, we will support it in the division lobbies  Since the where Fairbrother -- the Welfare Reform Bill first saw the light of day, we have warned of the flaws that have loomed large this afternoon. The reality of this Bill is that the people hit by it had no way to hide. They just have to pay up. The discretionary housing fund is in no way going to cover the costs and consequences of this policy when it is introduced. I'm afraid everything we there this afternoon has merely confirmed what my right honourable friends have said. That is why in divisions in this House and in committee we have tried to put in place safeguards which would have stopped the horror show that is about to begin in April. As the weeks up on by, the bolts -- the faults and the floors set out have become very clear. -- flaws. First, we learnt that someone who is handed a 12 month sentence will actually be exempt from this policy. And in 2011 A he we have this list of offences which have attracted an under 12 months sentence. There are something like 43 people who were convicted of conspiracy to murder and today 12 months or less  They will be exempt! 273 people convicted sexual offences and it a less than 12 months  they will be exempt. -- and did a less than 12 months  Yet mothers of men in the Armed Forces will be hit. Families with children up serving in the Armed Forces on servers will actually be exempt. I know that you would never want to it unwittingly mislead the House. He's said that if someone is convicted, they would  That is not true. It is only if they are on remand. Basle Straw's great comfort from the fact that people who are on remand for sexual offences, murder, robbery and public disorder... I'm very happy to accept the Secretary of State's correction! Secretary of  just one second! You can't they be standing up at the same  I am sure he would have given  The House draws little comfort from the back that people on remand for these offences will be exempt from the implications of this  I just want to establish  It has been a very good principle in this country, going down the ages, that you are innocent until proven guilty, not guilty and Tell You are proven  The reality is, we stick to the existing structure. He is opposed to this measure, but he is now saying that as soon as someone is accused of something they should immediately be exempt.What the Secretary of State cannot defend his how families of serving soldiers will be hit by this policy. That is not something that the Secretary of State will want to  He should be speaking to his honourable friends and to the Prime Minister, whom I understand is the chair of the Committee on the military government, and he should be bringing to this House safeguards for the families of armed personnel on service. He is clearly not going to bring forward those safeguards for families of people serving on the phone line. Bauhaus will be disappointed. It is not just these families. It is also foster-parents. -- this house will be disappointed. I listened closely to what he said, and he said nothing today they account of man's what he sent out earlier, which says Anne house that has a spare bedroom for a foster child will be treated as and occupied. So families in that position will be  Then we are that, under universal credit, a couple where someone is a pension and someone is not will also be hit. Two birds of the people hit by this tax will be  -- two thirds. 200,000 people who will be hit by this bedroom taxed are on DLA. The National Housing Federation estimate that if you spend all the discretionary housing fund helping those people, it would help 73,000  So there would be 127,000 people in receipt of delayed who would get absolutely no help  That leaves nothing but foster-parents. I'm afraid the Minister cannot simply plead that the discretionary housing fund is going to help the disabled, the foster-parents, because the trick is something very different. Much has been said about particular groups who are hit by this, and I think the right honourable member is a right to talk about the impact on disabled people and foster  But there are also lots of people like one of my  who have children who are expected to share the same  sometimes with a big age  I would not ask my children to  Is there hypocrisy here? I of course there is. Mr Deputy  this is a policy which is unique in its cruelty. It has set out to tackle a problem of under  and the Minister made much of the one million that spare bedrooms that he wants to somehow bring onto the housing market. But, as he knows, the only way this policy will save the money chalked up in the Treasury's account, is if  That is the reality of it. About £400 million is earmarked to be saved from this. That is that the cost of families. That is are those savings are delivered. So this is not about bringing his spare bedrooms onto the market. This is about hurting vulnerable people and asking them to pay extra. I'd been what is particularly troubling for many on this side of the House is his refusal to acknowledge that in many parts of the country there will simply not be the houses that are small are the people to meet in two. Again, the National Housing Federation has been clear about this. In large parts of the country, there is simply not a housing stock for people to move into. So what has happened here is the government has removed any shelter in which vulnerable people can take cover before then opening fire. So I suggest to the House this is a policy of unique cruelty. The government is not seeking to solve under occupancy, it is simply seeking to make the poorest and most honourable even poorer. The Secretary of State once cared about  Perhaps he would like to justify that. Can he explain why, when he was in government, two important things? Firstly, under their changes they introduced and  Same-sex children were subject to exactly the same criteria the we are now introducing to the social  And secondly, why is the crumbling -- groaning about the number of social housing in existence when he was the one, his  who left the housing situation in such a state?

For the last year it -- that records were available, housing stocks have fallen by 11%. That is the reality of what this government has delivered. This is not simply a cruel punishment. This is a cruel and unusual punishment. It is a cruel and unusual punishment because frankly it is  it is not usual in a  advanced and civilised  to reward the rich in quite the way this government is proposing while punishing the poor. It beggars belief that next month, but the month in which those on not £1 million a year will get a £2,000 a week tax cut, those with a spare bedroom at a being asked for a £14 a week rent rise.

That's in stark contrast to the Deputy Prime Minister on the fact they cut capital too far and too fast.Would my haub friend accept that the -- honourable friend accept that the savings that are projected are gross savings, not net, many local authorities will end up with voids, without rents, and will make losses and not able to do will he pairs at a time when private sector rents will be pressed up by excess demand giving returns to buy-to-let and increasing housing benefit costs, it doesn't add up? My honourable friend is right. I will, in a  It may be, Mr Deputy, speaker that the Secretary of State truly believes that this is a policy that is going to save his department £490 million a year. I have to say that the minister was rather less than forthcoming in swearing that would be the figure. It maybe that the Secretary of State believes that this is a policy that is going to save £2 billion over the forecast period. It maybe that the Secretary of State genuinely believes this. But if the Secretary of State genuinely believes that this policy is going to save the money set out by the Treasury in budgets gone by, he is deluding himself. Because the evidence is now staring him in the face. This is a policy that is going to cost more than it savings. -- it saves.

Would he like to apologise and explain to the nationalists one of the reasons why we are in this predicament is that their house building collapsed under his Government It did not collapse. In the final years of our Government we brought forward serious new investment for housing and it is actually this party that is proposing serious investment in social housing, and in new housing  It seems to be a position that is shared by the Deputy Prime  It is his Government presiding over an 11% collapse on the houses building built. I thank my honourable friend for giving way. Does he not agree it is hypocritical for the Secretary of State to talk about investment in housing when as my honourable friend has just pointed out... THE SPEAKER: I'm sure he didn't mean to use the word "hypocritical" and carry on asking the question.  it is extraordinary for him to be talking about this when he is putting many of our housing associations and registered landlords at risks. Moody's have downgraded housing associations  which means they will not be able to invest in the houses they have and building new ones. My honourable friend is right. We are to thank the National Housing Federation for the estimates they have produced for the amount of arrears which housing associations now say are going to grow. In fact some estimates I have seen show that housing associations are looking at up to one quarter of a billion wear the of arrears because of this policy and other changes the Secretary of State is making.  at a time when the country's debt rating has been downgraded, that is going to make things incredibly difficult for housing associations, to deliver on future bills of social housing. And this bedroom tax is only going to make  I give way. I thank the honourable gentleman. He has moved on from the point he was making about the so-called millionaire's  But given it is a certainty that members of the Opposition will come back to it  Can he explain, as he is particularly well-placed to  given he was in the Treasury it was only in the last,  37 days of the last Labour Government that in fact any measure was taken to increase taxes on the richest people in this country? He is going to continually refer to  he should be, being a former Treasury Minster, be prepared to explain that. It will not have escaped her notice that the fiscal circumstances of today are somewhat different to the fiscal circumstances of the 13 years of the last Labour Government. She  I will answer her  as soon as her front bench has simmered down slightly. The truth is that this Government has delivered a double-dip recession and perhaps worse. It's just presided over a downgrade in the nation's debt rating. We have had growth that has been flatlining for the last couple of years. That has made the deficit position far  Government is going to borrow more in this Parliament than Labour did in 13 years. And so, the question now has to be: how is the pain of paying down the deficit shared? And Labour has always said there has got to be a mixture of  of sensible public spending cuts and that is how you get the deficit down. What you don't do is give a £3 billion tax give-away to Britain's richest citizens while you ask 000 people to pay an extra £14  How would she justify that to her constituents? That is not good enough from the right honourable gentleman. The financial crash happened in 2008. There was  by independent agreement, there was a structural deficit at  In order to not to bequeath either to their own incoming next Government or the  as it turned out, the  in order not to bequeath a rising debt surely he can not just fight fact no action was taken in the immediate years of the aftermath of the financial crash. Mr Deputy Speaker, if we are going togl become over history, first, she will know at the time the Conservative Party supported Labour's spending limits, the announcement made by the then Shadow Chancellor at the party  I think at the time. The question that confronts the country now is how do we bring the deficit down. Once upon a time we were told we are all in it together. Now we know the opposite is the truement once upon the time the Chancellor said he wasn't going to balt books on the backs of the poor. Now we know the truth. He  Starting with £14 &amp; extra a week for 660,000 people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm afraid the evidence now, that this policy is going to cost more, is staring the Secretary of State in the face, just as I can see it clearly, too. He will have read the reports, from all over the country... He will have read the reports from all over the country, and perhaps he can confirm it from a sedentary  he will have read the reports that have gone to Cabinet that have set out the impact of his changes it communities up and down  He will have read them,  And they could not be clearer: they confirm the substance of the letter leaked by the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State  That up to £20,000 people will be made homeless as a result of these changes. Not including the impact of the Benn benefit cut. And they are councils like Hull City Council that says 6,700 tenants will be hit -- 4,7 under. Yet in Hull there are just 73 one bedroom and two bedroom properties  There is a short fall of 700 properties for tenants. If they are to move into the private rented sector, or if they are to become homeless, it is going to cost the taxpayer aer if tune. This is a policy that is going to cost more than it saves -- a fortune. We have heard powerful arguments today along the same lines. So, - and I'm not surprised that the minister is no longer prepared to swear by the savings that this policy is supposed to deliver. So here we  Mr Deputy Speaker, a department at the height of its  A department that has brought us a work programme that is worse than doing nothing. A department preside overing a Universial Credit system that I understand is on the brink of collapsing into chaos. -- presiding over. Now we have a policy that will cost more than it savings. Why is this? Because we have a Secretary of State who has been rolled over by a downgraded Chancellor. And he has not had the strength to resist him.  we now have, Mr Deputy Speaker, the worst of all worlds, we have a department bedeviled by an excess of stupidity and an absence of  The cost is not paid by the  it is paid by the £1 million children plunged into poverty by his department and the 4 million disabled people that will be 49 by his striver's tax. Instead he should be bringing a tax that will bring the welfare bill down by actually getting more people into work. And we now have nearly 1 million young people out of work. We now have nearly 1 million people out of  long-term, and that is costing us a fortune. He knows,  that the housing benefit bill is set to rise by £8 billion over the course of this Parliament because of his failure to get people back into jobs. And that is with why he should be arguing back. He should -- that is why he should be arguing bak. He should find some spine and say it the Chancellor - it is a time we had tax on bankers' bonuss to build new homes, get people into work. Say it people in this country - you cannot spend more than two years on the dole. At that stage you have got to work. That would be a proper plan for welfare reform. It would be a proper plan for welfare-to-work and it would be a real alternative to this policy which is a cruel and unusual punishment from a cruel and useless Government.  here. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this really important issue. As a former Chairman of housing in Bradford and Chair of the regional housing board for Yorkshire and Humberside, I know the importance of social housing and housing benefit and how it plays in providing housing needs. I say that because my own family, extended family have used it and do use it now. In my district alone there are tens of thousands on waiting lists at the moment trying to gain access to social housing. It was the last Government's fillure to build sufficient social housing and I have to say the record of the former Prime Minister, who raided the regional housing boards funding allocation of some tens of millions  which could have been spent on addressing this housing shortage. I have to say, he did give some of  redressed or repackaged as new money in the months leading up to the next general election but the reality is the last Labour Government robbed, out of the regional housing fund allocations, millions of pounds which could have been spent on social housing, which was allocated for social housing, which could have addressed some of the issues we would have been facing or are facing today. The present housing bill of £23 billion a year is costing each individual familyeds 900 just to sustain. And -- family £900 just to sustain. That is unsustainable. This Government is attempting to put fairness back into social housing, bringing the social housing sector in line with the private sector rental sector. I have to say, I would like to  I would like facilitate the building of more social housing, it is really important, particularly in the housing market that we have at this moment in time, to get people on to that property ladder, if that's their opportunity and gi get them in stable housing. I would like to encourage the Housing Minister to spend his efforts and his limited money, some £300 million that our Government has allocated for developing social housing and putting that money into areas like Bradford's canal corridor and the excellent communities scheme in Springbank in Keithly where this Government is delivering social housing, where the previous Government has failed. Much has been spoken in the last hour or so about adopted accommodation. And for the disabled. As I put on record what the Government has actually said it is going to do, as opposed to the somewhat misleading conversations that have been coming out from the benches opposite. If you live in accommodation which has been significantly adapted for someone who is disabled, you will be entitled to a discretionary housing payment. That will make up - that has the opportunity - you may gain access to that discretionary payment and that will hopefully address some of the short fall. And for issues, on issues relating to foster caring, £30 million of the Government's discretionary payment has been specifically aimed at foster carers and disabled people who have made changes to their home and where the disability means that the household has a need for an extra room, local authorities have been allocated a further £150 million to make discretionary payments in those circumstances. I think we need to publicise this  A family came to see me recently in my surgery. He is profoundly deaf and she has an open, permanent wound in their intestines. They need separate bedrooms but nobody told them that this fund was  therefore, they are very  I think we need to have some more education so that disabled and vulnerable people actually are better-informed on We need to make sure vulnerable people are not misled by some of the interesting conversations being the interesting conversations being put about. This change is coming in  Is he satisfied with the way the government has publicised the point he is making now? I think we have an opportunity today to put that forward. I think the presentation given by the Minister was excellent. But it is appropriate we him -- we use all rabbits to put this into the public  -- all methods. During my time as a minister I visited many  and I have to say many were in very poor condition. Some were sold for as little as £1 because people could not live in them. So we move to actually transfer all our housing stock... By all means I will give way. We have been talking to councils for some time about  We are urging them to get talking to their residents and they are doing up. It isn't helped when other people go out telling things that are untrue. There been lots of scare stories about pensioners, for  Pensioners will not be affected by this. We are doing our best to get the information across. The truth is, as a Conservative, I care about is a disabled -- I care about the disabled. We should not allow the opposition to brand us as that nasty party. Lots of our councillors out there up a working really hard for those vulnerable people in our society, and I know the people on our benches care about those people. I want to address the point I was making  We wanted to transfer our housing stock into a not-for-profit  We read -- renovated bit you 000 houses into decent quality  -- week renovated 30,000  We also started a maintenance scheme to sustain them. It is successful. But I would like to point out that a local Labour  our trade unions, voted against all that package. They actively campaigned against it. I listen to this corner coming from the opposition benches. When it comes to real action, you don't want to do it. Those Labour representatives were prepared to allow people to live in slums rather than pert those interventions in place. Does the honourable member accept that some county councils kept the whole of their housing stock in house and have done an excellent job renovating section after section after section of it? He should not be saying that because the council chooses to keep it in house or to give it to another authority that is the deciding factor.Well, I don't know whether taxpayers of Brad Bird were going to find £1 billion over 30 years to actually renovate those houses. -- Bradford. And those people living in social housing were betrayed by the Labour  I want quality homes, and I'm going to work to make sure that  The reality is, the housing benefit budget has doubled  That is on the back of the economic failure of the last government to address this. We have to spend with a non- means. The public rightly expects that we get a grip on our benefit regime. A regime which the Labour Party allowed to get out of control. They failed to build the social housing, they failed to manage the economy, and they have therefore clearly failed those in social housing and those who need access to it. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. I welcome today's debate on this very serious  Last week, like many  I spent time in my constituency, and every conversation I had with  local managers, banks, post offices, housing associations and credit unions were centred around the so-called bed room tax. I listened carefully to the Minister's Commons today. He took great pleasure in referring to the spare room at subsidy and to the question of equity. It reminded me of the debate over the poll tax in the early 1990s, when it was considered equitable that the poor should take a heavier burden. It resonates today right across this  But what struck me about those conversations last week was how unprepared we are for possibly the most dramatic setback for a housing sector and a local communities in decades. Firstly, amongst the tenants. Housing providers understandably earnestly hoped until the end of last year that they could persuade the government to change its mind. Then they started to write to their  and in turn many tenants put those letters in a safe place and hoped it would goal weight --  It is only since this year that and it's a woken up to the true horror as housing associations have started to not at their doors. -- that tenants have woken up.

The impact on a housing associations cannot be underestimated. Earlier this month, I raced with the Minister State for Scotland, who is not here today, the impact on their credit rating. This is not just a technical point. Many experts are quietly talking about the need for wholesale accommodation of local social landlord so they can avoid bankruptcy as they face a huge hike in arrears and their administration costs would only very small reserves in many cases to buffer  That impact is to be worsened by the introduction of universal credit from later this  I was interested to note that even the chief secretary of the Treasury is now beginning to voice concerns about the impact of taking rental directly to tenants. I'm happy to give way. On a point, would my honourable friend that some of the opportunities available to local authorities consist of thirsty taking the hit on arrears, secondly cutting the amount of repairs and maintenance to make  and thirdly knocking down walls in people's houses to convert two bedrooms into one- bedroom? That is what is being actively done. I was a former housing chair myself. Unfortunately, I represent a seat in Glasgow and all socially representative -- rented properties are in the hands of housing associations. And they  so they do not have the resources that a local council does. For some of the smaller local  they will be pressed to be able to cope adequately. If I could refer to the responses after  the Minister of State assured me he had met with local produce in Scotland and with housing associations, had discussed concerns about credit ratings, and that they were, in his words,  Funnily enough, the following week, a representative of the housing associations in Scotland it wrote to him to put him perhaps in a different position of their own views.

Considerable concern  Perhaps the Minister today in his response can confirm when his honourable colleague intends to actually meet with local authorities in Scotland to discuss with them what they are actually going to do about the impact of this change what happens in just a matter of weeks. Mr Speaker, today, my honourable friend made a number of suggestions for changes which could happen in Scotland. I think, unfortunately, her colleagues in the Scottish government have placed -- pressed the pause button. We need to wait for the war -- Davis and starts to shine and they get independence. -- the sun to start  We need to start having a serious debate about how to resolve these issues. The Coalition talks about the ever-rising cost of housing benefit over the past 10  Yes, it is a problem that we are subsidising landlords when rent increases well above the rate of  There is not one suggestion or proposal from the government's side that we need to address this problem. The systematic failures in the housing market as a whole have changed permanently since the banking crisis in 2007. They are not going to bounce back to where they were around 2005. So, here are some suggestions about what we could do to deal with housing as a whole. It is not just people currently on housing benefit, it is the whole market which has suffered a major How much land is held by building companies as part of their land backs? We believe it is quarter of a million houses which are still to  which have planning  Where is the audit of where those properties are. -- are? I believe in many cases, builders are waiting for the day when they could actually just get more money for the land on which they sit. Could we control private rentals? The Honourable Member for Banff and Buchan quite rightly commented that rental levels in the private sector  as in many other parts of the United Kingdom, are in excess of that in the socially rented sector. Shelter Scotland states that on average in Edinburgh, the taxpayer would pay more than £1 and -- £100 extra in local housing allowance each month, compared with the private sector. The same would be true in Glasgow and Inverness. In Aberdeen, one part which is enjoying a bit of an economic boom, you would pay £200 extra per month. She did state that she thought those increases in rentals were a phenomenon which only applied in the Greater London area. I think on  she is quite incorrect.  there is a shortage of  and people cannot have fired -- afford to buy a house, so they are moving into the private rented sector, and rentals are being pushed ever upwards. That brings me to a point which was commented on by the Leader of the Opposition last month, and which I think age to be looked at in  which is the reform of the law on residential leases. It was last altered back in the early 1980s to create for the first time a -- for the first time short term assured tenancies. That has now become the default. Although there is clearly a market for short-term assured tenancies, it is not suitable for an increasing number  who are looking for security and stability and to put down roots in a community. Does she not recall that many years ago, we have the rent officer regulating rents in the private sector - does she think that is a possibility? The Honourable Member refers to something which I am not an expert on in England, but it still remains in Scotland that if you have a long term secured rental, it is subject to regulated rents. There are a tiny percentage of these are still left in the United Kingdom. The average age of the racetrack is probably 85 -plus. Frankly speaking, there were not attractive to the market at the time. -- the average age of the residents. What we are seeing increasingly in urban  and London is the most  but it happening in Glasgow as well, we're getting increasing intransigence in our local communities, with people having to move house over more  not because of choice, not necessarily because of work, but simply because their landlord thinks he can find another tenant, who is prepared to pay a higher  We need to find a way to stabilise the market, to get rentals back down again, and we can only do that by improving  and I think that is something which the Scottish Government should start an urgent debate about. There is no reason why Scotland should not lead the  I am happy to give way. Can she confirm that should the Labour Party find themselves in government following the next Westminster election, the Labour Party will introduce rate caps for  He raises a good point. But I would point out that the Leader of the Opposition has already stated on the record that we would reform the law of leases in England to create longer term leases of about five years plus, which I think would be a good measure in trying to stabilise the  I think we also need to provide much better systems to register social landlords. In  we have many small housing associations, as I have  These associations need to be much more proactive in seeing how they are going to be able to cope with the additional cost which will  undoubtedly. They also need to look at whether we need to move towards a planned consolidation of housing associations. Because the consequences for local communities - Housing Association is not just simply your landlord, it is often the body which acts as the hub of your community, providing community  arranging contact with other bodies, such as the local police or schools, and is very much in control of local tenants. It is a representation of what they think the community reflects. So, it is really vital that should there be a need to consolidate housing associations, it is done in a planned way, and that they are fully supported throughout that  I also believe in Scotland that we need to look at the local authority powers under Social Work  and how these can be  As other members have commented today, Mr Deputy Speaker, the cost of eviction, the cost of trying to house people under the homelessness legislation, is a high cost to be born. In many cases, it is much easier and cheaper to the public purse that the person remains in their house. Finally, I think we need to look at increasing the council tax balance, to find out whether we can levy the additional £50 million per annum which is estimated, roughly, that it will cost social landlords and  in order that we can have a buffer zone. I do believe that those with the broadest shoulders should take most of the burden. Doing nothing, Mr Deputy Speaker, is simply not an option. Dropping the bedroom tax and working to reduce housing benefit costs in a sensible and co-ordinated way, with  housing associations, local authorities and devolved administrations, which does not kill our communities, is and should be the only option which should be on the table of whatever government door you enter. I urge the Government to reconsider, as a matter of urgency.  Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a policy which clearly has led to a lot of debate and a lot of concern. Some of that concern has been based on misunderstanding and misinformation, but some of that concern is based on the fears that people have about the changes that they will have to face in April this year. Mr Deputy  I don't think anyone in this house could argue with the principle -- House -- behind this piece of legislation, which is to deal with the fact that there are people in social housing with more rooms than they need. But I think the problem here, and the reason we have had the level of concern that  is that this is a disagreement on what is actually the reality of those rooms. A can of course have said that there are a million spare bedrooms which therefore are having to be subsidised by other taxpayers. But  the nub of this issue  are all of those million bedrooms really spare rooms? My  which I am going to express today, is that Sunset the Government has currently got it  I am asking them to look at this compassionately, and with common sense, to deal with those, not only through the application of discretionary housing, which is clearly essential, but actually to face up to the reality that there should indeed be further exemptions of certain categories. I will come on to describe those. I welcome the approach that the Honourable Member  but he appears to be proceeding on the basis that this measure is about making better use of housing in a planned way. But  and I think his front bench spokesman made it very clear, this is about saving money. It is clearly about both things at the  Were it not about each of those things, then the Government would not be issuing  which is absolutely clear. Were it not for the fact that this measure will save money, then it simply would not have been put  and none of us on this side of the house would have been asked to vote for it in any shape  It is in great contrast to  It is in great contrast to I have to say, there is still some  As the Honourable Gentleman has clearly heard, it is  which he refers to. I hope that is clear. But the simple reality is that the social housing sector does have a exemption in this regard, that the private rented sector does not. And it is important to go back to April 2008, when I was sitting on that side of  when the local housing allowance was introduced. I was a member of the Work and Pensions Committee at that time. It was not an entirely controversial measure, as members opposite will remember. We scrutinised that and raised concerns about it at the time. But the then Labour government was absolutely clear that housing allowance would depend not only on the maximum rent allowed for properties in that area, but also specifically on the number of rooms that you would need. So, again, I say that the principle behind this, to bring this into the social housing sector, is a reasonable one. I think it would be helpful for the opposition to at least acknowledge  to say that we do wish to assist and encourage people who are currently over-occupying, who have more bedrooms than they need for the family, to seek to find alternative accommodation to free  Because we all have huge  and we can blame the previous government, or the government before that, for simply not buying enough. Or the absurdity of allowing the right to buy a council house without building council houses in return. These are things which this government has committed to finally addressing. I thanks the Honourable Gentleman. The previous Labour government always had difficulty with the issues that he has just mentioned, but the difference is that the way it is being proposed now is a  I'm not sure how that relates to the point are was making. But I have to say that his own front bench were committed to benefit cuts in the 2010 manifesto, which they seem to have conveniently forgotten since then. But as I have already said, I do not believe that currently, the Government has got this policy  And I do believe, and I have expressed this to my colleague, the Honourable Gentleman, and other ministers and colleagues, that I  as well as the exemptions which currently are in there, for people of pensionable age, those in shared-ownership, local housing, temporary housing, the recently  and people who have an unpaid carer providing overnight  I firmly believe that there are other exemptions which should be included. I said this at the time of the passage of the bill. Of  we were not successful in achieving any of those amendments, which is why I did not support this  I made clear that I could not support the policy then, and as it stands now, I cannot  The exemptions that I believe should be included - first  very clearly, if two partners have to sleep in separate rooms due to medical reasons, due to disability, I believe that is a clear exemption, if it is deemed that they have to do so. Similarly, if a child with a disability, whose disability means that they are deemed to require a separate room, they also should be exempt. Because social housing does play a different role in the housing mix, and particularly, it is there to support families in that sort of  at the same time as having a low income. Of course, that would help with the current issue and the Court of Appeal  I think the easiest thing for the Government to do would be to accept that those exemptions Does he agree that foster-parents should also be examined? I've had foster-parents in my constituency saying that this is potentially putting them of continuing to  Would it not be better if foster-parents who runs their bedrooms -- had spare bedrooms which are used to bolster children are exempt from this as well?Well, he has pre-empted me. The next thing on my list is foster-parents between children to be cared for, which is the point. A lot of the criticism of the government has been party political and unfair, which is within the nature of democratic policies. But the principle behind this is a reasonable one. We do need to try to address the issue because of the housing crisis that we face and to enable the families in overcrowded accommodation to get appropriate  But another key objective is obviously to see more children placed within Hotspur -- foster  and to encourage more people to Boston. Without that  I do believe that they will be threatened. And the other category which I believe should be there is the very difficult issue of separated parents. Families who  sadly, split up. That is always a very difficult thing every member of that family. In the majority of cases, we are talking about the father, not all, but the  we are talking about the father being the non-resident  And that non-resident parent has the job that three days or two days a week for a month.

But the reality is that parent wants that child to feel like this is also the home. -- the non resident  It is therefore perfectly reasonable for the non resident parent to maintain the bedroom and he bit as the child's bedroom, with the child's things in it. -- and  I think that is very  When you look at the fact that the child benefit is paid to the parent with care, there are significant financial pressures on the non resident parent, he still has to feed the child, possibly three times a week, and wants to provide things for them. So our request that they look at these things again. My honourable friend is right there must be room for this discretion, and some of that is rightly exercised locally. I will give way. Thank you. Does the honourable gentleman agree with me that the outrageous advice given by the government, the front bench, that vulnerable people, disabled  should take in lodgers, people of the streets, is a good idea? Vulnerable people will be expected to take people and it simply to remain in their own There are some cases where people do have the tries to take on a larger, to have someone from their family living there. The point I'm making is there should be clear exemptions based on clear medical need a for a separate room. If you have those then we don't get into that discussion. It no longer becomes necessary. Going back to the local discretion, where it should be used - and the whole thrust of what I'm saying is if we have those exemptions there, then discretion becomes discretion, rather than a set of difficult choices - the discretion should be used for properties that have been adapted a on the basis of need and on the basis of adaption... Very  I want to make some  Thank you. Does he share my concern that the discretionary payment is for people who have properties that are adapted, and many disabled people do not live in properties which have been adapted and are excluded. I have made clear what I bit is the exemption. That needs to be clear and straightforward, for people who need a separate bedroom for their  If that is the case, we don't need to have that discussion, then we have to look at the reality of the adaption and whether that should qualify. Similarly, there is local discretion if a bedroom is clearly needed for storage of medical equipment which, for  a child with a particularly severe disability.  there is discretion that can then be applied to people with certain mental health conditions. That is something that can be far better assessed locally Bennett could ever be through legislation. -- than it could ever be. The people who know best about the problems with housing stock our local our authorities and housing associations. We do have a problem where in some areas - and we know local authorities and housing associations have been keen to place people in accommodation that has been hard to let - often they will manage to boat people in who are under occupying.

And it then becomes ironic that someone has to her move away from that area which will then be lying empty. -- has to then move  Given this list that he has identified - and I can do nothing but agree with the thrust of his argument - does he think that the discretionary payment allocated by the government is adequate to meet even his list of discretions, which of course is not exclusive?The  we do need to have the further exclusions I've mentioned so there we are clear that discretion is for discretion, rather than dealing with large categories of people who many of us believe should be exempted in the first place. You can take the amount put forward by the  and divide it, that really needs to be targeted on the kinds of issues that I have  It has to be discretion, that is why I do think it is essential we have the further  I will give way. I  just on a point about  he would accept that many are worried because they will not be able to apply for the discretion until the scheme kicks  and by the time that they are assessed they will potentially have built up a rent arrears? That is not my understanding. Certainly, I am encouraging people to contact their councils now. That is the message each and every one of us  So I think there's a clear information problem there that needs to be dealt with. People clearly now what should be applying for those exemptions. I'm encouraging people to do so. People in my area already have. To ensure this policy does succeed in its two  its twin objectives of bringing down the cost of the welfare budget and also freeing up  which is what it is there to  I do also think it is important to allow the discretion so that people should only be subject to pay the additional sum actually if they have turned down reasonable smaller accommodation, because in  there are simply not enough one-bedroom properties  Also, we have heard from members of Euro-constituencies about the issue of being moved about the issue of being moved great distance as potentially. -- rural constituencies about the issues of being moved great  If somebody doesn't have  it will be difficult to get -- for them to get to work.

I do fully support the thrust to make sure that our welfare system is properly focused on those who most  The same should apply to a social housing sector, and there are difficult decisions for all parties going forward to deal with  to make sure our social housing is being used by the most honourable and by the poorest in  At the moment, it is  So we have to do that. But on this occasion I have to say to my honourable friend that I will be abstaining on the motion today because I still as this policy stands feel that it does not pass all the tests the Government has rightly set itself. I urge my honourable friend and the Secretary of State and colleagues to look at  to look very seriously at what serious -- further exemptions could be brought forward to deal with some of the issues that are still there, and to make sure they come forward with a full and proper programme of a review, to make sure that as this goes forward it can be reviewed to see if it is doing what it is set out to do and not leading to unfair and unforeseen consequences. If that is  they must make changes further down the line. I do urge they look at this again now before it comes in to see what they can do to reassure people and to improve  to show that really it is a way to bring down the cost of the welfare budget and positively try to deal with the problem of overcrowding that many families find themselves in.Thank you. I want to start my contribution by talking about the impact on Wales and my local area. I note the bedroom tax has been renamed the spare room subsidy debate. That sounds a lot better! I'm sure it will be of great comfort to those facing this in April. My honourable friend mentioned as part of their contribution earlier on the cumulative effect of welfare reform. This is just part of a cumulative effect that deserting the  I just want to mention the case of a couple I met. This was a couple who had worked all of their lives.

But on top of  his wife had been diagnosed with a condition and will now have to work another three years due to the government's changes to the women's pensions. Because of their experiences with the work capability assessment, they are now absolutely terrified of the personal independence payments, particularly the mobility component, which may lead to them losing their mobility vehicle. I hope the ministers do in no way underestimate the palpable fear and anxiety out there amongst the disabled community. This is a couple who have worked all of their lives until illness hear them later in life and they find themselves attacked on all fronts when they need a safety net. Also, the anxiety felt by advice services, housing associations and local  who in my experience are working extremely hard to deal  that rises to 46%, with the DWP estimating that 40,000 tenants will be affected.

My Honourable Friend is exactly right, that the cost of private rents will  which it will come on to. In terms of the discretionary housing payments, Monmouthshire is getting £121,000, although they forecast their rent arrears to be around 200 and put £5,000. The Government has just set a budget without knowing whether it will be  -- £225,000. It is as callous as the bedroom tax itself. If there is no social housing, renting privately might be your  and an expensive one. Given that the Government do not seem to care about the human impact of this policy, a cursory look at these issues... I will carry on. The Government might at least look at this issue. A cursory look at the property in my area illustrates  It is more expensive, even with a reduced local housing  Every single property in one area was found to be more expensive than the housing association properties.

This was illustrated to me graphically by two local cases, the divorced father in the two-bedroom house, who has his kids to stay at the  As he is under 35, he might be expected to share accommodation, with all of the child protection issues that raises. And the mother of four who was we howls after turmoil due to domestic violence having to uproot herself and her children, who have now got settled in school. The two youngest would have to share one room. I presume that would be a box room, a spare room. So far, the Government's response has been to shrug its shoulders and tell housing associations to be creative. In my experience, unlike the  they have spoken to their tenants and they know the reality, and alongside local authorities and the Welsh Assembly Government, they are being creative. But all the creativity in the world cannot alleviate the basic problem - there is no social housing, and payments to local authorities will not even begin to touch it. This is about saving money, and if it is, it is surely going to fail. It is a pleasure to have a chance to contribute to this debate. I think some of the contributions have been characterised by exaggeration so far. I don't think that has been very helpful. The contribution from the Honourable Lady has put before me, and the lead we have had from the Labour  I shall certainly be expecting the Labour frontbench spokesman later to commit the Labour Party to... Well, I will put it to Labour members who will be speaking later, in that case - what are they calling upon their front bench spokesmen to commit to, in any possible Labour manifesto, such that this measure would be reversed? I think all speakers from the Labour Party who come after in this debate really must say where they are standing. We are now closer to the next general lection there we are to the last one. It becomes inadequate for the Labour Party to say on everything... To be  the Nationalists, yes, .. With all due respect, it is quite easy to say, because you're not likely to be forming a  The Labour Party aspire to be the next government of this  and they claim they are credible on economic matters, in terms of balancing the budget and addressing the deficit - the moment of truth is fast approaching, where the Labour Party must say what they would do about some of these  I am going to develop this point a bit further. Unless the Honourable Gentleman wishes to confirm that he will be calling upon his front bench to make a manifesto commitment on this point. I thank her for giving way. I appreciate she came to this House  but can I tell her something she may not be aware of? The minister who opened for the coalition government today, when he was in opposition, along with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he condemned the Labour government time after time, when we were looking at welfare reform, and said we were not doing enough. They have completely flipped over, both of  and they are worse than any of her Conservative colleagues. With due respect, that was not in any sense a response to the challenge that I put out to opposition members. If I just quote something which the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said last year - has an benefit alone is costing the UK over £20 billion a year. That is simply too high. Beveridge would have wanted determined action from  not least to bring down the benefits bill and to help pay down the national debt. He would have wanted reform which was tough minded and asked everyone to work hard to find a job. Do you agree with the Shadow Secretary of State? I very much agree with My Honourable Friend. It underlines the problem that the Official Opposition have on this issue. To  I think the running total is something like £83 billion of deficit-reduction measures which the party opposite has voted  As we move closer to the next general election, and some comes a point where, to be credible, people have to start to say what they would do. That is not to say that everything... I don't think anyone would claim that all the Government's measures are perfect.  some thoughtful contributions have been made in this debate about certain areas which might need to be addressed. I welcomed the minister's reference to the rolling review. That was a sensible thing to say. But that is not the same as saying just a blanket opposition to these  The Labour Party strikes me over the last couple of years, as a new member, as the Honourable Gentleman said, as relishing the opportunity to oppose everything. But it is not credible, especially when one goes off to make speeches trying to re-establish some kind of economic credibility, but then coming here to this House week  month after month, opposing everything. And so will come a point where, and it would give way in a moment, where backbench Labour MPs in particular will have to accept that they will have to make some difficult  My suspicion is that reality will dawn on the front  as we approach the election, and they will begin to make speeches which begin to reflect something like the economic reality that Britain faces, and at that  all of those Labour backbenchers who sit here week after week, relishing the opportunity to oppose everything, to say it is dreadful to say things  we are killing communities - that was actually said in this debate! That level of exaggeration The problem she faces is that, despite all these cuts, the hardship that is being carried out, there is no growth, and in fact debt is now going to rise more than the Chancellor predicted. So despite all these cuts, or is  it is not working. -- all this hurting. It was always predicted that debt would rise. That is not a surprise. The structural deficit is being reduced. Going back to the intervention I made on the front bench, the financial crisis hit in 2008. It Labour had begun to address some of the structural deficit problems  we might not be having to take some of the very difficult decisions we have to take now. Why did they not start to take the benefit down in 2000 and made? -- in 2008? In my constituency, there will be over 2000 families unable to pay their rent. If that is not destroying communities at the same time they councils such as Wandsworth and Hammersmith are refusing to sell houses, how do they do than that? -- defend that? Wandsworth council tax has just been set at the lowest rate in the  The difference between a council tax in that bar compared to some others is an enormous difference and it illustrates the benefit of leaving people with more of their own money to spend on what  I'm glad he gave me that opportunity to pay tribute to Wandsworth Council's low-tax  Let's talk about is  I also have some people  -- about this measure.

One particular thing are wanted to say was on behalf of people you come to see me who are over  Nobody is claiming this policy will free up all of those one million rooms, but it might well encourage people to look at being in appropriate sized accommodation. Many housing directors a bin done this country would tell you that if they could put the people who want accommodation in the correct sized accommodation, they could resolve much of the waiting list. That is certainly what I've been told by experienced people. It this is a measure that starts to get people thinking and gives them encourage ment -- encouragement... Of course I will give way. Many councils encourage people to move. They enable them to move, they give the money to move. This will be part of that package. It is not draconian, it brings it to the fore. I think it is write a book on record that many councils are responding sensibly and imaginatively to the measures the government has taken. -- it is right to put on record. But there is no solution in social housing for young, single people. They are a group who attract absolutely no points, as we know. If some of the people affected by the removal of this subsidy choose to rent a Room out, are particularly would welcome that, because the particular group that are likely to benefit from that are some of these young, single people in areas like mine, where they are doing much-needed jobs, started  -- starter jobs. The honourable lady is questioning whether anyone will do that - people used to do that all the time.  there is exaggeration. People used to do this all the time  Raising people's fears is not productive. I've checked with my council and it is the case that council tenants, as long as they don't overcrowd or sub-let the  are able to taking a lodger if they so choose. For some people, that may be a sensible solution. For those single young people I see who I can give no suggestions to about where they might has -- where they might find socially subsidised  that might help them. If they are the winners in this  there would be a good  because currently they are the losers. I just want in particular to draw attention to some of the practical things councils are doing. We do have the extra £30 million of discretionary housing allowance, and some of that in my council certainly has led to a significant rise in the discretionary amount making use. They are put together a co- ordinated action plan, they have contacted all potentially affected recipients and customers, they are beginning to confirm that their benefit details, they have set up a helpline to discuss options to  They are in direct contact with some of those households as well as some of the social house -- social and works that will -- social landlords. There are quite a few sensible thing is that local council's planning ahead can do about this. Some people will choose other  But I think my plea from this debate - and referred it on so many welfare changes, in particularly from the Labour Party - when people come to opposition Members with particular cases of specific difficulties, especially associated with disability, that the first recourse is not to think, this will be an ideal opportunity to read out a story at Prime Minister's Questions, but to say, you may well be covered by the discretionary payment and I'm going to make inquiries about that and exercise my influence to say that you should be. The honourable lady did say a lot of people want to  and they do. I would like to say that after the next Speaker, there will be a time limit introduced which is less than the duration that she has taken, so I would ask now for some self restraint on the time in order the week can make progress. -- in order that we can make progress. I do wonder about the issue, the idea that you can take in a larger tax free - do the Labour not won this cash our communities? Is there a real problem with people taking control of their lives? Are they are only allowed to have top down roles? What is wrong with taking in a lodger? It might be like going down to the fifties, but we had real communities then. I think it is an excellent idea. I will wind  My principal point is this - these debates are not well served by exaggeration and panic mongering. There are undoubtedly difficult  We've all got them.

In Brighton and Hove houses affected will also be affected by the proposed cut to the council tax budget. And changes to disability living allowance.

The policy will not solve our housing  The local authority in Brighton estimates the total cost of an election process including temporary accommodation is around 000 per eviction.

The Government has given a pot of just over £1 million to Brighton and  It covers about 8% of the cuts that people will face. The Government try and justify these cuts on the ground they are making work pay but when ministers use that phrase it is a code for punishing people for being poor. Of course work should have pay. It should make a decent living wages  not poverty pay. But in the housing -- the one way to cut the housing budget would be to pay decent wages in the first place. There will be a potential push to move people from social housing to private housing. What the Government should be doing is increasing the supply of affordable decent homes and legislating for greater security of tenure, which would go some way to holding rents  It will take time but we need to find a real programme of sustainable mass council housing. Yet this Government is going in the opposite direction. This policy will lead to bad debts and undermined the stability of the social housing market.

I agree with her if she is urging the Government to do more than they are currently doing to get more mortgages  That would be welcome. I know the ministers are desperate to get more mortgages made available. They are working away with the banks to try to do this. That is part of the solution. But it is all very well for Labour to go into fits of hysterics but they really should try to take a serious interest because lots of Conservatives want better housing solutions for many constituents and people in other parts of the  Does the honourable gentleman not accept that in the past there was a very different view of social housing. It was not seen as something that was a precious resource. In 1951, in the election the Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 new homes. It was a view across the political divide that we wanted to build council housing to improve social conditions. The Conservative Government did indeed meet that pledge and that is many more homes than the Labour Government was building each year. They needed to do it because we were short of  The Germans had remodelled a lot of our housing estates and there was a big problem trying to recreate the housing people needed. Under occupation is a big problem and the Government has come up with part of the answer. The positive way of doing this is through  It is the encouragement, persuasion, through making available a better answer to people and the answer they currently have, which may be the larger property which may not be suitable. If we look at the proposals, the Government has excluded anyone of pension age from these proposals. I welcome back. That is smart politics and very sensitive to the elderly population but in my  where most people own their own home and where the elderly people tend to own it without a mortgage and younger people tend to end it with a Robert big and difficult mortgage, a lot of my elderly residents and constituents decide to sell the former family home and buy a smaller property and quite often they go on to sell again when they are getting more frail and they moved into semi sheltered or supported accommodation. It is a natural process in the private sector of trading down. There is sometimes too much of an obstacle for elderly people living in social housing to do that. Maybe they are not enough available. Maybe they are not offered properties in the  But I think it is perfectly acceptable have to try to create an atmosphere in which we can have the same sensible inability in public sector housing, as naturally occurs in areas with rather more private sector housing, so that elderly people can have housing more suited to their needs. I had my honourable friends on the front bench will look at the question of elderly under occupation but do it in a positive way which encourages and promotes and helps rather than removes benefit or imposes a tax. I do which the opposition would understand the meaning of the word  Imposing a tax actually means taking money off people who are earning it for themselves, and not paying less benefit. I hope the front bench work out an answer to the soundbite because I have seen the sound bite arguments beforehand I congratulate the Labour Party. It is better it says are than the sound bites we have got from this side of the House. I urge I honourable friends to come up with a soundbite which represents the  This is not a bedroom tax.

We need to look at the disabled and that is why I approached this debate with  because I wish us to be more generous to the disabled, not less a generous, and we feel nervous about how far we should go. I am pleased to see thereat different definitions of disability. I am interested in the people who are seriously disabled and that is reflected in disability benefit. I would urge my friends to be as generous as possible. I do not think it is a good idea to presume there is an easy solution and surely the best way he is there are issues that need to be sorted out is by support and persuasion and offering them something better. Surely that must be the end. Why would somebody move if it was going to be worse? But if you can show there would be better and more appropriate accommodation I might be more willing to accept this as a course to go that I would urge my ministerial friends to be extremely careful where it comes to the It is a misunderstanding of the  this is not Prime errors that -- primarily a spending cut  this is a policy designed to get more people into public sector housing that is suitable for  Surely that is the bigger picture we are talking about? And inadequate housing stock. Some people have got more about that they strictly need and other people don't have as much of it as they do on that needs definition. We are arguing about the balance of those groups of people and how feasible it is to solve the overall shortage by producing more housing. Even the party opposite must understand that if you were going for the Big Phil  it takes several years for that to come through. That big  I think Ministers are feeling very frustrating in this government that they have identified places the building and means for finance, but it is taking a very long time to get the housebuilding to come through so we can start to tackle the problem. Which brings me to my third point, about how you tackle the problem of insufficient housing and how you tackle the problem of excess welfare spending, and I think that is the issue of eligibility. When I talked to my constituents, they feel much more inclined to pay taxes to make sure that people who have been settled in this country for many years, born and brought up  can get access to proper  and if they feel their tax money is going to provide housing for people who have only just arrived don't seem to know how the system works well to get access --  That is somewhere well the Government could predictably concentrate its mind. I am sure there will be European Union rules in all this but we need to try and negotiate this with our European  or make a stand, because I think there is a strong feeling in our country that, yes, public housing will be limited, more limited than some would like, and  surely the priority must be for those who have been here a long time and have made a contribution and are part of the settled community, if we have to make choices, and that doesn't always seemed to be the case. So I hope Ministers will have a look at that as a proper avenue for considering excess benefit expenditure and the shortage of property available. So these are difficult waters, and anyone who looks at it rationally will agree that they raced under occupation that we need to tackle sensitively. They will agree that we beat more housing provision and we need to do what we can to tackle its -- that we need more. And I hope people will agree is -- that the best answer of all is to work away so that everyone can enjoy what every MP takes for granted, a well-paid job and we can afford to buy a  I would imagine everyone here owns a property, some more  and it has become a matter of comment sometimes, but it is normal for an MP to be an owner- occupier and enjoy that income and  I am sure, M Ps own pace their room for two.

That is certainly the view of the Scottish government as well, that it will have an appalling impact on families throughout Scotland and throughout the rest of the UK. That assessment also shows that eight out of 10 households in Scotland, as we have heard before, the ones who are set to be hit, have an adult with a recognised disability  Which is just extraordinary. Eight out of 10. 79%,  of the households in Scotland who are said to be hit by this contain an adult we they have recognised disability. -- with a recognised disability. This is as punitive as you can get. The Minister is muttering, do they need a spare bedroom? He is using a robotic mantra again that somehow it is able to have a spare bedroom. There are very good reasons to have spare bedrooms -- that it is evil to. The housing welfare Minister in the Scottish government has warned the UK government of the impact of this and highlighted the disproportionate effect on disabled people to this government, and ask them to rethink the policy. We did understand before the start of this debate that the Secretary of State had in fact instructed a rethink of part of this policy, and that is to be welcomed of course, but we found out that we are going to have a rolling review after it starts, of which went report for perhaps two years at the commencement -- which will not report.

I don't think the Government actually understand the appalling impact this tax is actually going to have, but I go back to what was said  The fact that eight out of 10 households will be hit, including an adult with a  is compelling evidence that the UK government must look again at this and do it quickly. As I said earlier, it wasn't just disabled people and Foster carers,  many others and two specific cases I would like to raise with the Minister. The first is that off a woman, a pensioner, who will not be affected herself but cares for her severely disabled  He is in his own  it has two bedrooms.

However, if he is also forced to move and manages to get rid that episode, because his mother, who has the caring responsibilities, also has medical conditions of around, she will not be able to carry out her caring responsibilities if her son is forced to move even a few streets away. So the real life impact on that family in that part of that community will be horrendous. And I am deeply disturbed that the Government have The thing is that the mother who cares is not permanently their  She is there during the  She may be their occasionally in the evening but she is not a permanent overnight care and this goes back to the discretion rather than the proper expansion -- of exemption of the people who have real disability. Have we any idea whether your constituent needs the criteria for disability? It is not at all clear whether that particular constituent could meet the criteria for the discretionary  -- criteria for the discretionary payment. And even so it depends whether there is any money left in the pop. I wanted to concentrate in the final three minutes of what is happening in Dundee the specifically. With figures from the council they tell us that there are 3,300 of this, 583 it will lose 25 % of their housing benefit. That is a loss which will have the impact of a tax. The other 2804 will want to lose 14 % of their housing benefit. Tenants it -- tenants in a two-bedroom property could lose £9 IG3 a week. £516 a year. Those with two so- called spare rooms will lose an entitlement of £20.70 a week, over seven -- over £1,000 a year. Does in Mr understand what the loss of 000 a year means -- Does the Minister understand, to families are struggling to make ends meet and doesn't he understand the consequence of that level of indebtedness. Legitimate lenders will not lend to people in these circumstances. Credit unions will only do so much. The consequences will be picked up by social work and health services and the police and the cause to the public purse for a policy which is unlikely to save this Government any money in the first place. The anger within communities, if the honourable gentleman is Arif -- brief. I attended a meeting with officers of Dundee council who said discretionary payments run the very limited because they do not have the funds for it. I also asked if they had smaller houses to good people willing to move and they  He sums it up quite nicely. The discretionary pot is small. And by quite like discretion in general. It is helpful.

It is a great pleasure to follow the honourable gentleman the Member for Dundee East and to listen to this debate. When the nationalists have their day it is always a reassurance for those of us who are unionists because by their presence in the chamber we -- they show how much better off we are together than being a separate so I would like to thank them and hope they will stay  But I am very pleased to ever to speak in support of the Government's position today, a Government which has a position  measured and just. My right honourable friend the Member for Wokingham put it absolutely right when he said we have to think about those people, those constituents are asked to come to us and want social housing because they have got a family and because they have an extra bedroom and whom we cannot help because there is a house and being lived in by one person who has too many rooms and there is no pressure on that person  So we here a lot from the other side about one side of the equation but nothing about the  That side of it is avoided.

Those with larger families living in smaller accommodation or in the private rented sector find that they cannot get into social housing, into council houses, because there is his problem of underoccupancy which we have discovered a from the Government is actually one million  Just think how many of our constituents could have better housing if only those bedrooms were  But the Government is also measured. It is measured because it has put in discretionary powers to look after people who are going to be in particularly difficult circumstances, and discretion is very important. I think the Government has got this absolutely spot on, that if you were to say that every house that had been adapted in every way for a disabled person were to be exempt, you would find that a property that had a Little Rock brought to it or one hand rail was suddenly exempt, -- a little room. So refined the policy was removed but the way it has been done -- is being and you will get the overwhelming benefit of the policy without casting a very heavy burden on the small number of people who genuinely ought to be exempt and ought to be  The same applies to the £5 million that has been made available to families who foster.

Whereas if it is done by a discussion it has to be a reasonable case that is brought forward to encourage those that have the discretion to except you ought to be allowed to receive the extra funding to allow you to maintain your current position. But it is also just. It is just because you have to ask yourself what are benefits for? Bar benefits they're to allow people perpetually to remain dependent on the state? All are they there are... It is always a pleasure to give way. He is displaying a total ignorance of this policy area and I am sorry. First of all, the bedroom tax applies to people in work as well as out of work. Second, it applies to people on benefits who cannot  Are I am grateful that even if you cannot work you can taking a larger and get £20 coming in without any effect on your benefits, so people can actually be better on because the average somebody would lose for having one room is £14 so actually the Government has a policy that makes people not in work potentially better off, and those who are in work can also be  because they similarly it will be able to take in lodgers, but they make the end of to move, they may be able to move to cheaper housing -- they may be able to move. They may be able to move to housing they can pay for themselves rather than being dependent. As usual, he makes an excellent series of points. Would he also agree with me that for those people who can work and are in some want, the sums involved are only allowed in many cases to two hours of minimum wage per week to make the difference up, as well as the option, of course, for those who cannot work, of taking a lodger? I am very sympathetic. But I think people need to take responsibility for themselves and they need to be able to make choices for themselves. And the choice that they have is to maintain the benefit that they need for the housing that they need, or to stay in housing where they have an extra room and adjust their behaviour accordingly. It is not for the state putting its expenditure on the backs of hard- pressed taxpayers to fund indefinitely people's lifestyle  And it is a choice for people East they decide to have one extra room -- if they decide to have one extra room which they are not actually using. They have a choice of moving to an extra property or under this new policy they have a choice of whether they find a way of getting the extra income that they need. I thank my honourable friend.

I have raised an intervention against the Movement for Dundee East on this point and it is important because when you free up a three or four bedroomed social housing property, that may well be Phil by somebody who is in the more expensive private rented  That doesn't go into the cheek the social housing sector but perhaps the person in that property goes back into the private sector.

I am extremely grateful to the honourable lady but it was not my intention to tell you and it dates. But in my house in London I have four bedrooms with seven people living in it.

We should be proud of this Government and proud of a look Dem Minister for doing We have had a number of very powerful speeches from all of those concerned about this bedroom tax, who have outlined very, very fully the implications it is going to have on many of the groups that are going to get adversely affected. I represent a constituency which is going to be very strongly affected by this particular policy. We have 700 households which are likely to be affected by 1st April, and many of those constituents already know they are going to be  They are waiting to see how the local council and the Scottish government react to what the coalition government has done that at the moment, we have around 700 tenants that will be affected by these new rules. That is just over 51% of the tenants in receipt of housing benefit in the area. That is because of the type of the accommodation we have in North a  The reality is, like in many parts of the country, there are many fewer one-bedroom properties. -- very few. A recent the commission report said that across  62% need a one-bedroom property but only 34% occupy one. There is this mismatch, the types of accommodation that art reality - - in reality available and the people who are living in those accommodations. I think we are facing a crisis on the 1st April. Irrespective of the strength of some of the points that might be made about some people that might be living in properties that are too big for them, the reality is that this mismatch means that on the 1st April are going to be looking for two-bedroom properties. Those people are going to pay the price of this government's moral and economic policies. Only in the last few days, this country has lost its triple A rating from the credit agency. The response we should have seen from this government is an understanding that what we need to do is invest to need -- gain growth and one of the most important places we could do  given the housing crisis we have in this country, is to put money into housing, particularly House -- social housing and council  Thereby, I think it is tragic that the nationalists have chosen this debate today, because it is the right debate to have  because so many of our constituents are affected, but we should be having that debate about what we do to get growth in this country and what we do to make sure that we invest so that our people have decent living standards. Because the reality is that council housing was created in the first place to provide decent housing for those that did not have it. The whole ethos of council housing was to build properties that were of a higher standard than had been available to ordinary working people previously, so it wasn't about whether you had a spare  because the idea that you had a figure living room, more space in your property, was actually part of what the whole project was about -- a figure  As I made the pointed the intervention, that was a policy that was quoted to cross the political divide across -- after the Second World War, and I think it is tragic that we have got ourselves into a position that we are now not seem the type of social housing being built in recent decades that is needed for ordinary people in this country. We know that many people are simply not going to be in a position to move on 1st April, and as we have already had from the interventions that were made from the honourable member from Dundee, the reality is the discretionary funds that are available to councils now simply are nowhere near enough to be able to implement the kind of discretion that the kind -- the honourable member for North East Somerset would like to see, because the reality is the money is simply not  We now that people in adapted properties in all of ice constituencies are going to have deductions made from their housing benefit on the 1st April.

Not necessarily one, it may be a  You don't there are many bedrooms You are going to need and the whole idea is you have a household that is able to take those children. We know that that disabled people are going to be at the forefront of this policy and the honourable member for Dundee East has already highlighted that 75% of those affected in Scotland will be in a household that contains a disabled person. But the figures for the rest of the UK, 63% will be affected. So even though the figures may be more extreme in Scotland and in particular parts of the country, the reality is, I  this is going to become a significant problem in all of the  even in wealthier parts, because even in wealthier parts of  if you have some poor people there will be facing the kind of predicament that many of us see perhaps on a more regular basis  are a regular basis. But what I would say to the Government, this is a policy that is going to have massive impact up-and-down the country and on government, particularly on local government. It is estimated that if this policy works as the coalition government expected to work, it will take £50 million out of the Scottish economy. That is going to have implications. A lot of that is taking money out of the pockets of individuals and out of the pockets because there are communities, as we all know, where significant numbers of people are reliant on the benefit system, whether they work or whether they  Because they work and live in areas which are low range  Some areas with glorious industrial past, if you go that the  14,000 people were employed in my constriction say that constituency.

That is not the position we want to be in, that is the challenge we all face collectively. What I would say to this government is taking money out of those communities, taking money out of the pockets of individuals that live in those communities, is simply going to grind those communities even further down. What we should be talking about today is the kinds of economic and welfare policies that would be putting money back into communities, that would be investing for growth, that would be putting job creation at the centre of all of our policies. The reality instead is we are faced with a policy that is going to end  that is going to cause misery to literally hundreds of thousands of people up and down the  and I believe it is a policy that the Ministers sitting opposite will wish they had never been involved in.Thank you for calling me to speak in this debate.

The reality is that most of these so-called spare bedrooms are not spare, but are actually needed by people who are living in them. There, I say this not because of any party politics but because of what my constituents have come to speak to me about in my surgery and the letters I have received from my constituents. Virtually every one of those people who have written to the or contacted me, I can honestly  cannot fall into the criteria in the way the Government is presenting its policy. I share with the Ministers and other members of the House some of their constituents that has spoken to me and their situation. I have had a number of constituents who are single parents, who have children visiting them who do not live with them for the whole seven days a week but may be three days, two  depending on the court  All of these people who are currently living in a two- bedroomed place will be severely affected by this provision, so what do you say to those parents who do not have the money to be able to go into private rented accommodation or buy a home with a double bedroom?

We are also talking about people, the honourable gentleman for Somerset north-east was saying you can have apart outside the home described as  but the people who come to be our elderly people, people who are very unwell, whose homes have been adapted substantially and thousands of pounds have been spent altering them on often quite small  They may have one small bedroom which may be counted as a bedroom but it is at tiny space, enough to put their wheelchairs, they commode, as in the frame, all of the other implements that disabled and unwell people have. Often these people tend to be in social homes, and everybody here knows about social housing, certainly in my constituency, they are small homes. They may be one- bedroomed flat but they tend to be very small or if they are two-  they are very small  where a person will need space to be able to manoeuvre. So what do I say to those constituents to write to me about them, who are being told they have to find somewhere else? And who have not  £800 per year to be able to pay for that. What about the situation where you have a parent, perhaps a parent who has two children of the same gender? Then they have three bedrooms but they are tiny bedrooms. Trying to put the children in one tiny little room where they cannot actually do anything apart from maybe have camp bed some bunk bed -- or bunk beds, to tell those people you have to go and you cannot stay in this House, and if you do, you have got to pay  These are the kind of reality is on the ground and we are putting a tax on foster-parents.

You have to go to high levels of  training and red tape which takes place over the course  Even years, and then you are assessed as a person who is suitable to be a Foster carers. So suggesting that you can somehow just become a foster carer to avoid having to move out of your home and claim for your extra bedroom does not really fit the realities of what actually happens in these circumstances. I now many members have already touched on these particular groups of people -- I  I a gain ask the Ministers to reconsider this. -- I again.

Even the £30 million set aside for this, what happens when the money finishers? Is there going to be more money put into the fund so that people can still continue on benefit? Would it not be better to have a policy where you actually, instead of making this statutory, actually work with councils and housing organisations, and housing associations, and say let's try first and foremost to work out if you can read organise housing needs and place people appropriately in homes -- reorganised.

The majority of  98% of the people, will go into different categories. And there is the issue and a need to address people who are waiting to be housed in proper homes or accommodation that fits and meets  I get constituents who are in a similar situation as well. But the way to tackle this, and it is an unusual idea, is actually to consider the question of home building programmes. It is all right everybody here saying what  but we are at this moment  Instead of looking back at what could have happened, why don't we deal with the current problem we  which is acute housing shortage? And it is not the case that this will be subsidised. Everybody knows in reality that the cost of building a house on a piece of land is not as much as the actual value of the property of the value when it is put up for sale. We know that the bricks-and-mortar has do not cost as much as the value of the House, because that is over inflated values. When you are talking about realities, when groups of people get together and start building homes or associations volunteer to, if they can pay for those houses and they are not subsidised, what we must do is encourage local authorities and groups to invest and allow these housebuilding programmes to take place which will provide housing Think about it instead of amazing - - making this compulsory, encouraging people instead.

It's the housing benefit bill would fall by 300 million into his 1012-13 and by £400 million for each financial year for the next two years. It is now projecting an increase of £700 million for 2013-14. There is a multitude of reasons for this up by far one of the key factors is the spiralling cost of rent. As rent  more and more working people are faced with falls in wages have met the eligibility criteria for housing support.

Rent caps have been a fixture in New York since the 1940s, and New York is the home of global capitalism. Rather than targeting social housing tenants, the UK Government and devolved governments if they have the competence should intervene in the private rented sector and the social sector. The other long-term solution as we have heard from other members he is to address supply and demand issued by building more affordable housing. The recovery in the UK after the Great Depression was in court -- in part thanks to the massive house building plan. It will create construction jobs, driving demand in the economy, and as far as this debate is concerned, it will reduce direct costs in the private sector and are thus the housing benefit  My constituency offices have already been approached by worried social tenants surrounding the technicalities of the new rules.

I also caught on the Scottish government to act to alleviate the burden of this tax on the people of Scotland. Across  local authorities are already suffering as a direct result of severe cuts to their budgets and finding it impossible to minimise the impact the bedroom tax will have on many constituents across Scotland. I will give way. One of the most important thing perhaps is the classification of houses and the reclassification of bedrooms which might be used for other purposes and are not bedrooms  It is an option, but as I have already said, the difficulty in my own constituency is we have limited accommodation and the reclassification of other bedrooms as if not bedrooms is not an option  I have been working with many agencies in my constituency who have been offering advice to those who feel they did not get affected by this tax -- who will get affected by this tax and feel they will fill -- fall foul of this tax and lose their home. Again, I think the Scottish government could offer more help to local authorities about how to cope with the impact we all know is coming. Mr Deputy Speaker, the bedroom taxes not a West Minster attack on Scotland alone. As we have heard  it is an attack on many constituencies across the UK -- Westminster. I join with others here today and will end on this  I would again call on the Government to abandon this unjust, unfair and very unnecessary tax. I'm going to leave the chamber to help launch this document, that links between speech, language and communication needs and social disadvantage. The reason I mention this in the context of this particular debate is that one of the key findings is that when you test children at the age of 22  if you take the top 25% of cognitive ability in children from working-class backgrounds and compare them with the bottom 25% of children from upper middle class  by the age of 10, the upper middle-class children have overtaken the working-class children because of issues surrounding speech and language  What I would suggest... I will give way in a moment but if I could make this point, I would suggest the dislocation of communities and working class families caused by this particular housing benefit move, which is basically to evict parents after the children grow up, which will be to -- will be targeting again the working class and people who could do so much better in life and at so much more in terms of tax revenue,  hardest.Would he agree with me that based on the speeches we have had from the Government benches today, we do not have a selection of those people from the middle classes who have overtaken the working classes. It certainly is the case that it is very disappointing and eliminating that we have empty green benches  People simply don't care about this group of people they believe will not vote. They just think they are people who have failed in life, they won't go out  and we can treat them  And that is what they  Isn't it also indicative of this debate that when people are encouraged to take lodgers, it is usually lower income people? There is no great push by the Government to ask the middle-class and the upper middle-class and indeed the upper class to take lodgers into their mansions all their castles or whatever? It is the bottom end of  it is shameful. I am very grateful indeed for that particular intervention. The reason is that the Government is quite falsely claiming that the problem is under occupancy in the social sector. That is the reason it is a terrible  isn't it awful? I have asked the figures from the House of Commons library about occupancy rates and the level, I am told, according to the bedroom standard is that in the social rate of -- social rented sector is 10.2% and in the private sector is 7.2% and in the owner-occupied sector, 49%. So it is all very well, if you own  you have five times the amount of under lock up in say, but if you are poor, you are in the social sector and the market is betting you down, you are not allowed an empty room. Why should you have an empty room? We have heard about people with disabilities and chronic problems, but what about normal people, people who just want their friends to come and visit? They chill -- their children to come and visit. Who would want a one-bedroom house? Let's have a look at the evolution of social housing. I have been chair of housing for Croydon and the London boroughs authority, and how do social housing work? What happens is we build two and three- bedroom houses for families in need, they come along with their children, their children grow up, they go off and they get a job, maybe go to  get married, move  whatever and we end up with a situation where a couple are in that and occupied House. What happens then? They die and be recycle those houses. So it is no surprise that the level of under occupancy in the social sector is  it naturally refreshes  These people did not live  In Croydon, we set of incentives of thousands of pounds, saying you are either old man or an old lady living in a three-bedroom  will give you a few 1,000 that you can go to a two-bedroom. There is still room for the grandchildren. Times are tough, and  It is all well for the Minister to say it didn't work, he hasn't tried it out. Why doesn't he put these models side by side and see if they work? Instead of looking at the so-called savings and the benefits, why not look at the cost? The cost in terms of community breakdown, in terms of family breakdown. What does this differ people's capability of getting a job? Apparently, the Government wants people to get a  get some training, get some  Well, it is absolutely  For social and economic and practical impact of this are completely unthought out and the  they don't care, and they did get because they don't think these people vote. Why is it that people over the age of 60 are included? Because they vote. So they are saying do not have any children and Tony Watt 40, because if you do not and they are about to  you are world going to be hit -- until you are 40. It  What does it mean in terms of the practical implications of managing the housing revenue. It is claimed we are going to save money, the sort of money we are going to allegedly saved is lost by local authorities. I have run housing revenue council, what will happen? The number of people will stop a war of events by the margin that is  and the local authority had all of these two or three- bedroomed houses, hardly anyone bedroomed houses and they say to the people who are not paying their  we will the big chip, there are no one bedroomed houses, so they get into the private sector -- we will achieve. The prices escalate the private sector and it costs be more as a manager. So people in the private sector to build -- cannot build money to save a deposit and buy a house. It is absolutely hopeless. A friend of mine in Fort William this -- has tweeted me to say his parents to five years to downsize. That is an example of have difficult this is. This was at the time when there was no imperative to do so, just choice. They were saying that -- they were in the same code for five years. Why should somebody who has grown up in the same street, they know the neighbours, the schools, the local pub and have worked locally or whatever, why should they be dislocated and thrown into the community or another 10 or even another nation, for that matter? --  The answer is they do not count because they are poor and they are in social housing and we are the Tories and the liberals and we are going to sort them out! It is disgusting. Going back to the manager or the director of housing, you have less money so you cut down  So we have more damp, more problems, more associated health problems with bad housing that we have already seen. What about other local authorities. People in Swansea are thinking about looking down walls. -- knocking down walls. If you have a two-bedroom flat, not their the walls and you have a large living  That reminds us of the window  Some stupid Tory. They are blocking of the windows, what a surprise! We will see that again. It is ridiculous and farcical and if it wasn't so sad, we would all be laughing at this. Private rents will go up so the mates of the Tories who have the buy-to-let and all of this, their incomes will  People buying other houses and we will see empty houses  People. NT houses on the public side and if you have empty houses on the public side, it is costing much more than this shortfall that is being cut in this  I would give way others, because I'm going to run out of  I might at the end. -- I will not give way. We are going to see major problems. As was mentioned by the Shadow Secretary of Wales, the Union Act of Wales, one of the poorer areas of the country, 46% of households were affected and 31% in  so it is almost 50% more,  Again, this is taking a part of the strategy, taking money out of the poorest communities and for people obviously spend more. If you want to growth strategy, you want to give money to poor people instead of rich people who hide it away in savings account and offshore  People who have got no money have no choice but to spend  Again, we are deluding local authorities before populations -- with poor populations.
