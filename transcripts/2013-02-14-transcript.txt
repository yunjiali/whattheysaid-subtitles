Number one Mr Speaker.  this being Valentine's  I'm sure you won't find it inappropriate for me to wish you a very happy Valentine's Day! Though I'm sure I'm not the first person to have done that this morning.  the Government is clear about our commitment to delivering legacy over the next ten years. We have made substantial progress across the five core areas of sport and healthy living, economic, community and regeneration of East London and the Paralympic. I wish the same to the Secretary of State. Chris white? Thank you Mr Speaker, you took the words right out of my mouth! 20126 fantastic year for sport in our country. -- 20126 fantastic year for sport in our  It is vitally important to follow up the next few years, particularly with the young people we have the potential to influence. In my constituency a charity called scat kids Run Free is charity to get kids passionate about exercise, and has groups in pre-school and  These races have spread across the West Midlands and the charity is keen to do more. Can the minister tell the House what support they are given to charities  and how we can ensure they get the resource they need to build a long-lasting Olympic legacy. My honourable friend is right to pay tribute to organisations like the one he has mentioned in his own  It is organisations like that can inspire young people to get involved, and stay involved in  It is those sorts of organisations that we, as a  are supporting through our youth and community sports  and a billion pound is being invested in this, over the next five years. That, plus the work of Sport England, makes us well placed to capitalise on the momentum we have seen coming out of the lick ims and Paralympic Games. - Olympics and Paralympic Games. The Government initially tried to scrap school sports partnerships, and then changed the mind and put funding back in. Account Secretary of State tell the House how much of the targets for schools sports participation are being met by children in school these days? I'm sure as the honourable member will have read in the press, Ofsted has taken a special report on this issue and found there is an improvement of school sports since  That is something we can all applaud in the House. Clearly there is more we want to do and build on the momentum on the Olympics and Paralympics, that is why we are continuing to put forward investment for the school games  which we think is an important legacy project. We will he will still be looking at how we make sure teachers in schools are able to provide just the sort of physical literacy we know young people need. May I commend my honourable friend of the work of the Government to achieve lastinging willcy. Can I ask her to focus on the financial legacy. In particular -- lasting legacy, can I ask her to focus of the financial  and the money not spent. There is a lottery campaign supported by over 3 ,300 charities for the money to be returned. I know it is her intension to do so, can she give an indication of when that will occur. My honourable friend is right to bring it up, the role of the lottery in many organisation's lives is pivitol. It is not yet possible for us to finalise the accounts, and therefore it is a bit premature for me to give any indications of, it is also premature for me to give any indication as to when that will  Certainly I understand the point he's making and organisations want to know how this is going to be working as we move forward. I thank the minister for the statement so far. Northern Ireland played a very significant and important part in both participation and medal-winning for Team GB at the Olympic, can the minister indicate what discussion she has had with an equivalent minuteser in Northern Ireland to -- minister in Northern Ireland, about the legacy there and the chances for young people who want to be an olympian there. The honourable gentleman is right, every corner of this great nation pulled together and supported the Olympics in a fantastic way. My right honourable friend has a cabinet committee that looks particularly at the issue of sports participation, and particularly the Olympic Committee that I chair as well is looking at how we can make sure that participation continues to groi grow over time in every part of the country -- grow over time in every part of the country. There are local organisations that are looking at this in his part of the  Number two Mr Speaker.Mr  the London 2012 games put women's sport on the map, and we are committed to maintaining that very important momentum.Will the minister join me in welcoming the news that Korians rugby club recently received �50,000 National Lottery funding a club keen on increasing women's membership. I know my honourable friend is a very keen sportsman himself, and I'm not surprised that he raises the important role that women play in  And I applaud the work that is going on in his constituency to make sure that happens. He may well already be aware that as a result of the Olympics and the Paralympics, we have seen more than 600,000 more women participating regularly in  I think we can see no finer  in terms of the contribution of women in sport in this country, in the women's Six  which are going on at the  I'm sure every member in the House will be supporting their home team. The Secretary of State is quite right in the achievements of women during the Olympics. The fact is, that the figures show that 30%, sorry 36% of medals won at the Olympics were actually won by women.  in terms of sponsorship, actually get less than 1% of  Will she do something to try to redress that significant imbalance.  the honourable gentleman is absolutely right to raise the fact that sponsorship can be a critical way that we not only increase the prominence of women's sport, but also enable more women to go to an even higher level within their  It's something that I have been particularly looking at, with people who are setting up support systems in that area. And recently  I think importantly, a Round Table with the press, and with governing bodies. Because we also need to create the demand for that  and that's all about creating increased profile for women in their sporting areas. One of the issues very important to girls in participation sport is the prominence of role models. Could the Secretary of State actually update the House on the timetable for improving the broadcasting, and indeed the reporting of women's sport? Clearly the improvements around the broadcasting and coverage of women's sport in either broadcasting, indeed, the press  is really down to the editorial control of those organisations. But what I absolutely believe is the Government can have an important role in voicing the belief of the  which is that there is great women's sport going out there, it needs to have support, certainly, I have been working with the press organisations and the broadcast organisations to highlight the great work that they are already  and also building on that  Last night a packed meeting here heard from the inspirational Claire Lomas and Martine Wright, they had overcome extreme difficulties to take part  They found their own  But there are many bar  sir to girls and women's participation in sport. What is the Government going to do to encourage the 87 women in pal -- 87% of women in Salford not participating in The honourable lady is right, it is important we reach out to women and help increase participation further, I I have already cite the really dramatic impact that hosting the Olympic and Paralympics has done in terms of racing participation amongst women. But I think there are some specific sports that are having a really successful track record in this  Netball is one of the fastest-growing women's participation sports in this  and participation has increased from 1 10,000 in 2005, to 000 just last year. There are examples in cycling and hockey as  There is good success there, but we need to make sure it is echoed in other areas too. Three Mr Speaker?We are investing some �380 million in urban and rural  when you take into account local authority funding, and private sector investment, that is more than a �1 billion going to roll out broadband. I pay tribute to the minister at Government for prioritising the rollout of broadband and significant sums of public money it has been completed. OpenReach has been successful in many of the contracts to extending the broadband participation. They can be inaccurate. Some of my constituents have switched from fibre to the cables but doesn't get the speeds that were promised. Based on the inaccurate service, can the minister make sure they don't come back looking for different money. I note the average speed has gone up from 7.5 megabits to 12 megabits, we are investing �12 million inle rolling out  I have note what he says about speeds, it is important customers understand the speeds they will be getting. Several organisations, including the ones that are involved in the delivery of the project have said that the Government won't now meet the target of 90% of households having access to superfast broadband by  What does he say to the 2.6 million households, who will have to wait between three and five years extra to access basic broadband?What I say to the country as a whole is BT is undertaking the most ambitious rollout of broadband than anywhere in the world. We have the most ambitious rural broadband of any country in Europe. We are set on delivering superfast broadband to the vast majority of people in this  which is a world-beating internet nation. Thank you I tribute to the Government rolling out internet to rural areas and areas of outstanding natural beauty. But the growth and fra structure  some provisions in it -- infrastructure bill will take away some areas -- Is it necessary to put these areas in jeopardy to achieve rural broadband. It is right at the strike a balance between protecting the rural environment and removing obstacles that slow down the rollout of broadband so it can be laid cheaply and more efficiently it is right to strike a balance, I note what the honourable gentleman says.The House knows by now that it was Labour's policy to rollout broadband across the nation by 20  The Government put the target back to 2015, and BT now say that it will not be achieved until 2017. Could the minister tell the House what the impact will be of the decision the Prime Minister took to agree the 09% cut in the European broadband -- 90% cut in the European broadband budget last week. We wouldn't expect any impact on our proposals, we are well on the way of rolling out superfast  Awful Europe sees us as a leader in that respect. I'm delighted we didn't introduce Labour' telephone tax on hard working people, and instead we are delivering superfast broadband to the vast majority of people in this  Villages in my constituency, including Birt, are desrate to have the same standard of broadband as the urban centres in my constituency. Can the minister guarantee that every possible effort will be undertaken to secure private and public investment to get the right levels of connections across my constituency? I can absolutely guarantee that I will strain every  particularly as her constituents are so ablely  and I know she will continue to hold me to account. Mr Mr Speaker w your permission I would like to take this question with question ten. Local authorities do have a statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service and fund  My department monitors the local departments for library changes in England. And the annual statistics from detail provided by local authorities are published towards the end of the year. Some how I wasn't expecting the minister to admit the grave situation his Government has created in the library sector. He should know many councils across the country are facing the prospect of closing down the bulk of library buildings in the community as Government cuts  How does it help the minister to fulfil the statutory duty to promote the library service. And what message is he sending to young people in the communities about the importance of reading and What kind of message is the honourable gentleman thinking when he talking down our library  Local authorities have always paid for and provided  they fund libraries to more than �800 million a year. There are thousands of libraries opening up and down the country, and new libraries opening, our library service is in good health.  the minister doesn't have to shout when he gets in a bit of a corner. And I wish him the very happy Valentine's Day! The fact is on this side we don't believe there should be no change in the library service, we have to move with the times. But the library is the centre of a civilised community. They should be  so they are havens where people can go, kids from poorer homes can do their homework. We should look at them being set in the community. It is the Government's job it lead on this important issue. I thank the honourable gentleman for that point. I wish him a happy Valentine's Day and note his Valentine's tie Mr Speaker, I agreed with everything he has said, that is why we have appointed a specialist libraries' adviser and set autopsy fund with the Arts Council to support libraries with  I would go on but I don't want to take up too much time. Is my honourable friend aware that Devon County Council has chosen to keep all of its libraries o. Isn't that the point, that despite is facing the same pressures as every other council, it has made a political choice to support the library service, isn't that the way forward? My honourable friend is absolutely right, we will see thousands of Conservative councils up and down the country taking the tough decisions to continue to provide frontline services for their residents. I welcome the Government's decision to fund six libraries becoming business incubators, but it comes at a time when unfair local Government funding solutions moon that since 2010, 640 libraries have either closed, are under threat, or have been left to volunteers. So why is the Government not developing a survival strategy to support local authorities. Why is the Government not recommending alternatives for the delivery of  Where's the vision, where's the leadership? I sometimes wonder if the Labour spokesman looks at a single thing I'm doing. We gave responsibility of libraries to the Arts Council, we have set aside a �6 million fund. We have published the statisticss, and piloting automatic membership for schoolchildren. The honourable gentleman roll over when Newcastle proposes to cut culture and libraries and says he backs  Number five Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker the Prime Minister has established the cabinet committee on Olympic and Paralympic legacy through which all Government departments are working together to deliver a tangible and lasting legacy from London 2012, sport is at the heart of that process. It's growing evidence that sport has a vital role to play in improving behaviour in schools, health outcomes and also in preventing reoffending and youth offending as I have seen in ashfield young offenders institute in my constituency. Will minister pledge to work with colleagues across departments to make sure interventions like this are available to young people to turn their lives around. Absolutely, I believe that is a process that is already happening, if you look at the work that the Department of Health is doing through Change For  if you look at the work done in the national centre for sport and excellence in medicine. The cross-departmental funding that has supported games is very evident there. The minister will be aware of that have central to the betting shops, business model has been betting on  But we now have the development of these fixed-odds betting terminals. The high stakes and speed of play of which have led them to be described as the crack cocaine of gambling. In my constituency there are over 50 of these terminals can I ask the minister what they intend to do about the problem? Mr Speaker, I'm not entirely sure what that's got to do with advancing the role of  But the answer on f -- what appears in this subject, is they are subject to the review of the state and prizes, the responsible gambling trust is launching the largest research ever into the effect of fob tees, if they show a problem to be addressed I'm sure it will be impressed.The minister rightly implies it was an elastic sense of sport. Today's report from Ofsted of sport in schools calls on the Government to devise a new national strategy for PE and school sport that build on the successes of schools sports partnerships. Partnerships which this Government has totally undermined. It is unacceptable that six months after the Olympics we are still waiting for the Government to deliver a coherent sports strategy. If they continue to delay, they will fail the generation we should be  How many more damning reports need to be published before the minister gets it, and gets it Government to deliver the sporting legacy that our children deserve.  the first thing is that the opposition spokesman should not conflate sports legacy with a schools sports policy S he's well aware that the sport legacy is going extraordinarily well. 1.75 million people that he never, ever tends to mention playing sport, who were not playing sport at the time of the bid. Plus a range of international events, and 14 million extra children touched around the globe. As far as the Ofsted report is concerned, if he's going to criticise sport provision on the back of it, he should wake up to the fact that it covers the  to 2012, so throughout the period that the schools sport partnerships were operating. If he wishes to see them reintroduced, he has to explain to this House and  how they are going to be  about which we have heard not a jot from the opposition since the election. Number seven Mr Speaker.  we have been clear, alongside the DCMS Select Committee, that we expect the Football Association to reform governance of the game as a top priority. As part of this we expect the FA to show representative, accountable and strategic leadership, and help develop football across all levels, including the grassroots, non- league and professional parts of the game. Thank you minister as a director of Warrington Town Football Club I declare an interest, it is a club that wouldn't exist if it were not for dozens of donors and dozens of unpaid volunteer. Other non-league clubs are going bust, yet 50% of the money from our national team continues to be diverted into the professional game, which is really very wealthy. I think the Select Committee has mentioned this is a  cot minister update us as to progress and fixing this allegation? Mr Speaker rer, yes, there is a fine dividing line here. It is not for Government to tell sport how to allocate money it raise theself, any more than it would be for us to allocate the ECB's broadcasting or the RFU's income from Twickenham. However, he's absolutely right to high loyalty the issue. If we can get the reforms at the FA that we and the Select Committee are pushing  part of that would be to empower the board to make precise low the sort of decisions that he's  instead of relying on a very abitary 50% split. Non-league football is the bedrock of our beautiful game. As the honourable gentleman says, many community clubs are facing extinction, like Bellington  a community club in my institutecy facing extinction. How will the Government engage with the Premier League to ensure the vast riches trickle down to assist the survival of non-league, community Well the Government is doing a number of things, and I entirely take the point that he's just  Absolute owe this is one of the key things we discuss -- absolutely this is one of the key things we discuss with the Premier League and the FA. The FA is in receipt of one of the largest whole sport funding awards, over �30 million which is there precisely for the development of the game and encourage more people to play  He makes a good point and we will address that in the reform process. Number eight. My department will have cut its original administration sex pendure in real teams between 2010-2015, from �50 million to �27 million, whilst continuing to deliver across the full range of activities, including a successful Olympic and Paralympic  Its actual administration budget will have risen from �50 million in 2010, to �55 million of  as a result of transfer of functions from other departments. In these tough times, private and volumity organisations in the Kettering constituency have to do more with less. Will my right honourable friend confirm she's needs to look at spending to give the best deal to the taxpayer. I give that absolute insurance, across the board in the DCMS functions and the new responsibility we have in our department from GEO and telecoms responsibility from the department for industry, all of those areas are expected to make the sort of savings I know that my honourable friend and his constituents would depebgt us to do. Including reducing -- expect us to do including reducing accommodation costs. Question number nine.The department al policy to pay at least national minimum wage to all  including interns.The BFI is due to redo you its policy on internships at the beginning of  Will the Secretary of State commit to writing to them to encourage them to pay their interns, so that all the opportunities this publicly funded body provides are available to all without financial The important thing the honourable lady needs to recognise is work experience and internships really is an incredibly helpful way of young people to be able to get into employment. I think the evidence is there to back that up from the work that's happening in the Department for Work and  The honourable lady will know that BFI want to make sure that work experience is available to people from across section of  and they have made sure -- a cross section of society and they have made sure they advertise the internships in that way to make sure it happens. Thank you Mr Speaker. Only 0.3% of the UK population is not served by any of the mobile network operators. The mobile infratruckure project is addressing up to 60,000 promiess and hot spots plus that announced in the 2012 putting. And 4g. Should go to 90% of phones. Mobile 4G will increasingly be very important in rural communities, such as those around Salisbury. Could the minister clarify the latest thinking on securing better access to BT networks by mobile operators, as this will be vital to the cost and speed of 4G mobile internet  experienced across the  particularly in rural Well, we look across the piece to make sure we can remove any regulatory obstacles to the rollout of mobile phone frain  as my honourable friend points out getting mobile phone masts is incredibly important. I would be happy to hear his concerns. We work constructively with Ofcom and BT to ensure that is effective. I am I'm pleased at the progress the Government is making and the minister's commitment. In a vastly spread out area like mine, many communities don't have access to mobile phone coverage. Can the minister tell us when we will appoint a supply for the mobile infrastructure project. My understand something we have gone out to tender for the procurement for the mobile infrastructure  We should hear some good All these appointments are paid under strong guidelines that can be  I would point out that in the appointments for which I have been responsible, we have worked extensively across  we appointed the former Olympics minister, I kept on form of Sports Minister as a trustee of the football foundation, neither of those two things were extended to this party in opposition. Topical  Question number one. I'm sure it is not escaping your notice that today is Local Digital Radio Switchover Day, in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and bed forshire. Better local radio services for local residents, including those in your own constituency. I would welcome the One Billion Rising  highlighting violence on women and girls around the country. And the Valentine's Day theme, is we are very proud of those who achieved success in the Grammys, with Adele and Mumford and skop  and Daniel Day-Lewis who triumphed at the awards ceremonies. Why is BBC radio Humberside axing jobs at the bottom, while nationally the BBC are continuing to employ many executives which many are paid more than the Prime  The honourable gentleman is right to highlight the importance of local radio in our constituents lives. But it is for the BBC to make the decisions around how it uses its money. But I'm sure they will have heard particularly cloudly the comments you have made today. Perhaps he will be welcoming the appointment of his previously honourable friend, James Purnell, in a prominent position in the BBC and perhaps he will be listening to the comments  News that in January that the athletics track and fitness centre has been awarded. Bell dear and the sports club, and pend Dell vale sports club. Will my Right Honourable friend join me in congratulating all the volunteers for securing their part of the Olympic legacy. With pleasure, and I would just add to my honourable friend's excellent question by saying that there have now been over 1,000 local community sports club that is have benefited for funding under places people  funding made available by the reforms to the lottery introduced by this Government, and opposed by the party opposite. With the Arts Council cut by 30%, Regional Development Agencies, who did so much to support the arts in  arts abolished, arts  smeared as tax dodgers, the Education Secretary trying to squeeze arts out of the curriculum, and local Government, especially in hard-pressed areas, who do so much to support arts in their local  facing the biggest cuts in a generation, doesn't she realise that it is her job to fight  for everyone. So will she withdraw her shameful assertion, that the arts community is disingenious, and their fears are pure fiction. And the honourable lady will know that the arts and culture of this country are absolutely at the heart  not just making us a great place to live, but at the heart of the growth strategy for this  that is the work that our department is doing. I think it is important work to show that it is not just a something that is on the  but something on the heart of making this a great  Perhaps she could, I'm very glad that the honourable lady has decided to show an interest in  I welcome that. I hope that she will underline the importance of accepteding messages to local authorities like those in  that the arts are important. I welcome her intervention on that area.Would my Right Honourable friend join me in congratulating Devon and Somerset County Councils on recently signing up for super-fast broadband, the new contract signed at the end of  But could I urge her to bring forward whatever announcements there are going to be about future funding and remaining funding available as soon as  so the momentum may be  We were delighted with the procurement for Devon and  one the largest programmes under the rural broadband scheme, and certainly we hear what my honourable friend says, we will do anything we can to help him in any way he wishes. A middle- aged constituent of mine, with no previous history of gambling, lost her family's life savings after being seduced by clever marketing by television gamj programmes. There is a new high-speed, high stakes gambling, which has cost my constituents at least �2 million. What can the Government do to stop this? I think the honourable gentleman raises concerns felt by a number of people across the House. The Responsible Gambling Trust has primacy in this I can't remember, it is in the process of conducting the largest piece of academic research ever undertaken. If the consequence of that is further action needs to be taken, and he and many other members have made this point very powerfully, the Government will take that action. I hear from many constituents who are subjected to a barrage of unsolicited telephone calls on a  despite the fact they are registered with the foal phone preference service. Will my Right Honourable friend undertake to look very carefully into this situation. It is caution great deal of stress,  particularly to my elderly constituents. I completely understand my honourable friend's  if he wants to come to the meeting aranged earlier I would be delighted to have him. -- arranged earlier, I would be delighted to have him. We need to crack down on this. As an Essex girl born and bred, I would urge the minister not to be swayed by the honourable members for Colchester and southend. But,  can I invite him to come and taste the delights and look at the art world and culture we have  I would be delighted and I have visited Plymouth theatre in the past. Will my Right Honourable friend visit the Jubilee Room on the 4th of March, when she will see at first hand just how wonderful Southend is, and she will learn that the only way is Essex in terms of culture, media and sport! My honourable friend is a very persuasive member of parliament, and I'm sure as many Members of Parliament will be there as can be. Tomorrow marks the start of London Fashion Week, I wonder if the Government would be willing to work with the British Fashion Council, which will be announcing a mapping exercise of manufacturing in this  in order to help support jobs and growth for all our constituents. I understand the honourable lady led a very important debate this week on  We certainly support the British Fashion Council's plans to carry out this mapping exercise, I'm working as hard as I can to see what Government support I can draw  The minister will be aware of the work of the Magna Carta cities of Salisbury and Lincoln to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta.

I would be delighted to meet my honourable  the anniversary of the Magna Carta will be extremely  May I recall with great fondless to the one of the libraries in one of my friend's constituencies, I'm so pleased that the libraries there are thriving. On many remote rural communities in  without sack access to any form of broadband, far less  Can the minister say what discussion he has had recently with the Scottish Government in order to ensure that particular issue is tackled effectively? Mr  we have made a very large allocation of fund to go the Scottish Government, and the Scottish Government is in the lead on procuring broadband, but should there be any issues arise, we would be delighted to have discussions What discussions has his department had with the Department of Transport regarding rail links to seaside resorts in order to fulfil the coalition's pledge in its tourism strategy.  accessed resorts and particularly seaside resorts is one of the key issues that will be a driver of domestic tourism, and one of the great challenges facing domestic tourism, where the numbers are increasing considerably is to get more tourists out of London and into coast resorts, that is absolutely one of the issues we are seeking to address. I'm sure that the Secretary of State will share my disappointment that libraries have become a political football between national and local  Would she agree with me that perhaps the best way of ensuring libraries' safeguarding in  is to define more clearly what institutes a national library service. We have issued clear guidelines to local authorities based on the chart's  I would agree with the honourable gentleman, I don't think libraries should be a political  it is important that local authorities are free to make decisions about the future of their library service. Decisions taken by a Labour council in Brent, but based on proposals six or seven years old and not related to cuts. Does the minister for tourism have a view on recent proposals by British airports authorities to raise the passenger charges at Heathrow? And has he plans to make representations to other Whitehall departments to try to address the potential effect on the tourism industry.  As my honourable friend is  If money is raised in one area and the thing is cut it has to be found from somewhere else. Raising these duties has the perverse effect of encouraging people to remain and take their holidays in this country. There is a balance here, it is one we are trying to address. Next week is the Brit Awards, where we will celebrate the massive success of our music industry, I'm sure the minister will be in his usual place. He will know that there is the usual challenges that we have for the music industry, particularly with the illegal downloading and  When can we expect to see the provisions agreed in the act passed here?The act is a good example of a rushed piece of legislation that wasn't scrutinised, we are doing our best to get it back on track with a number of bumps on the road. We continue to work with the music and IP industries to crackdown on piracy and payments to sites. I don't believe I have an interest to  anyone wish to call over my register of interests and come to a different conclusion, I'm happy for them to do so. Can the minister tell us if the Government's plans are to introduce a regulation of the gambling  and a taxation of the gambling industry on a point of consumption basis, what steps he will be taking to make sure that the Gambling Commission, prevented from empire building and news that they are planning to hike up the fees they charge. The point of the legislation, as my honourable friend is well aware is around consumer protection. The point of the legislation is entirely that, there are no plans at the moment for the Gambling Commission to increase that? My apologise, but demand has exceeded supply. Questions for the Minister for Women and equalities.  Mr Speaker, we now have more women in work than ever before, using their skills to gain economic independence, to see sustainable economic growth we need to ensure that working mothers can take full advantage of the full range of opportunities available in the work  And we are continuing to tackle the barriers that might prevent them from reaching their The Secretary of State speak speaks very warm words, but the reality is, in Newcastle alone, 768 women will be affected by this Government's mummy tax. Low- paid work and drop in maternity pay, 300 in terms of this Government's cuts to benefits and  We know life is hard enough for working mums, in too  too many women return  And we use their skills and contribution. Why is this Government making life even harder. I would really have tole challenge the honourable lady's assertions  What we are doing as a  and it is clear to see, is that we are giving women the tools and support to become economically independent. The facts speak very loudly. We have taken over one million women out of tax all together by this year. This is the sort of action we want to see, women coming out of tax, being lifted out of poverty, and being given the tools to actually be economically independent themselves. What working mothers need from employers most of all is  but employers find it very difficult to be flexible when lots of working mothers are thren  through no fault of  when schools are closed during snowy weather. As a nation, I don't think we're tackling this problem nearly enough. Can my Right Honourable friend have discussions with the education department to see if we can nail this problem once and for all. My honourable friend make as really important  as working parents we rely on certain tee, whether in childcare or schools. Decisions on whether or not schools are open is down to head teachers, they can assess things better on the ground. But I'm sure his point has been  and certainly I will make sure it is brought to the attention of my honourable friend in the Department for Education. Yesterday six mothers wrote to the Guardian to object to real-term maternity pay and other child related benefits. Having babies  but low-paid mothers are set to lose �1300 during pregnancy and baby as first year, from the real terms cut to statutory maternity pay, cuts to other pregnancy support and cuts to  The real term cuts to SNP alone is the cost of 24 nappies a week to a low-paid money. This Government said they would be the family-friendliest ever, doesn't that sound hollow now when the Government is helping millionaires more than mums? I think my honourable friend has to realise that in a time of difficult economic circumstances and certainly that is what we have inherited as a coalition Government,  we have had to make some tough decisions the. The tough decisions we have made are about helping women into work and helping women to have the skills they have to make sure their families are financially independent. Of course, the honourable lady will be absolute aware of the fact that back in April 2011, the child element of the Working Tax Credit was up-rated by �180 above  And that the reforms in the tax system, as I have said  have already led us on a path to take a million women out of  Surely she should be supporting those changes. Yes number two. I routinely meet my colleagues in Government to discuss the impact of policies on disabled  and before Christmas I met the Lord Chancellor about areas of common interest. I thank the minister for that reply, but could I draw attention to a chronic lack of funding that has led to crisis in social care, particularly affecting working-age disabled people. I would draw attention to a report of the care crisis by five leading charities. Particularly the fact we have had a colossal 45% increase in application for judicial reviews against local authorities social care policies. Does the minister think it is acceptable to undermine the judicial review process for disabled people, when they are simply trying to get the social care requirements they need?Thank  there is no undermining of the judicial review process. What's happened from 1974, 160 applications were made, last year alone over 11,000 applications were  and fewer still were  What we are ensuring is the right legal process, appeals  and those unmer to us ones  This is about ensuring the integrity of the judicial review system and the smooth running of the legal process. A phenomenon I see in my constituency, is private landlords are saying no housing benefit. She knows it is illegal to say no  no Irish and so on, but actually disabled people are more likely to be dependant on housing benefit than other people. Will she tell the House whether she believes that what private landlords are doing is legal or illegal, if it is  will she enable organisations of disabled people to take cases through judicial review to stop landlords doing it. Good local authorities work with good local landlords, what we will ensure that the correct cases go  We want to ensure the ining at thety of the system, and those people who need to take cases will be able to take cases. We are on the side of disabled people, and we will make sure their views are heard. Number 4. There have been a number of recent discussions involving ministerial colleagues in the Department of Education on issues in relation to ending violence against women and  These include a Round Table with police and crime commissioners and the Local Government Association on local commissioning, and a Round Table also last month on ending female genital mutilation. Thank you Mr Speaker, the Secretary of State has already welcomed the fact that one billion women are rising today, does the minister recognise though that the campaign wants the Government to do a lot  And will he in particular make sure's working with the Education Secretary to make prevention of violence against women and girls an intergrel part of education policy, delivered in every single school as part of a statutory curriculum, will she vote yes in today's important debate?We welcome the campaign, and we welcome the opportunity the House will have to debate these issues at greater length later today. Schools are free to teach about issues like sexual consent within PSHE or other  and children can benefit enormously from high-quality education that helps them make safe and informed decisions and choices. The DFE has conducted a review of PSHE education and will published outcome of the review later this year. Account minister clarify, is there a cross-departmental, multi-agency strategy in tackling the horrific practice of honour violence, can the minister clarify how effective this strategy is? My honourable friend is quite right to draw the House's attention to this abhorrent  Although of course he is the commonly received expression, I would urge everybody to stop using that expression, there is nothing honourable at all about this form of criminal activity. It is part of the overall approach we are taking as a Government to try to combat violence against women and girls and my honourable friend will know the Government has ring-fenced �40 million of stable funding up to  for a range of tasks of this  including the I can't remember he raises this morning. --The area he raises this morning. It is one billion rising today, and the minister's response to the member for Brighton simply wasn't  We have had too much warm words and waffle from ministers on this subject. It is no good saying that schools are free to teach about sexual consent, all schools should be teaching our children and young people not to harm each other, to have respect for themselves, and that sexual violence is not normal. That education -- the education zept has blocked any movement on legislation to introduce compulsory sex and relationship education with "zero tolerance" of violence, in schools, for three years now. They have been looking at this for three years and done nothing. They have to act. Will he now support the action and the debate today on introducing compulsory sex and relationship in schools to protect our children. Well as our Right Honourable friends behind me are saying "what  the idea that this is a social problem that began in May 2010 is to enject an unnecessary partisan tone into what should be an area that is beyond party  Of course these matters are taught in schools right across the country, and I'm pleased as well that the teenage relationship abuse campaign, which has been effective and welcomed by people of all political persuasions is also being relaunched today, and will focus on what institutes controlling and coercive behaviour, I hope it will have a compelling impact on boys in particular, but teenagers of both sexes, when they see that campaign. I'm sure the minister recognising the importance of cross-border co-operation in tackling organised crime like traffic of women and girls, will he do everything in his power to ensure that Britain continues to co-operate with our European partners on this important issue. My honourable friend make as very important point by the need to combat all forms of crime including the crime he brings to our attention this morning and co- operation in that. The Government is committed to working with other Governments right around the world to reduce serious and organised crime and the impact on the UK, and that very much applies to other European countries as well.

Can I thank the honourable gentleman for that statement?

I am glad they are investigating concerns about horse meat entering the food chain. I first raised these concerns last  Action must be taken against any criminal activity. I raise this problem with him last month. What action did he take with the FSA to reassure himself after I raise my concerns? Was he aware of Bute contamination before that day?

Has the FSA conducted tests on these products? Which other countries are testing a lasagne? We here in the media that this went to 16 countries. Why has it only been withdrawn in at six countries?

They don't like hearing get, but they are all keen on it now. I am afraid you have exceeded your time. Isn't there a danger that the most high- risk products will be withdrawn over the next three weeks and dispose of? It seems that he and his colleagues are totally clueless. Listening to the honourable lady, you would fail to understand, I  that we have probably the biggest investigation that has ever been conducted across Europe into criminal behaviour going on at the instigation of this Government. First of all, the meeting of the affected countries was called by us. We are also pushing for bringing forward that the labelling of food products as an emergency item. Exchanging data at a speed that has never done -- that was never done under the Government that she  Bringing forward an emergency meeting. Getting this matter on the agenda of Council on 25th February. I think that is quite a remarkable achievement. This Government is committed to proper investigations based on  One point that she raised, if she would stop shouting at me I will give her the answer, one point she raised about the criminal investigations following her assertions and this House about phenyl tutors on. She was repeatedly asked by the food standards agency to share the information she reported to have. She refused it to do so. I think every citizen in this country has a duty to provide evidence were there is such evidence. There can be a point of order later. Is not the right honourable lady's difficulty that it was under the last Labour government in 2006 that changes were made that led to there being no daily inspection presence in meat cutting premises? Isn't the reality that the public are becoming convinced that this fury is about shock-horror headlines rather than contributing responsibly to the sovereign of this problem two I have to say that when I hear from the opposition front bench are critical analysis of the very arrangements they put in place as odd was something that was invented over the last few  I find it difficult to take some of their criticism seriously. My concern is that this current scandal is just the tip of the iceberg and there is more to be uncovered about what is going into our food and what is and the meat supply chain. Can the Minister assure me that they will learn lessons from this epazote? -- We do need to get to the bottom of some of the supply issues in the fitting. Then we need to take a long and hard look at some of the practices. Retailers and processors across Europe need to look at the way they operate. I'm not convinced at the moment that they can be as convinced as they ought to be of the provenance of some of their goods. A can I ask my right honourable friend to consider  2012 committed declaration that horse passports of any horse treated by this chemical should declare and is appropriately signed that this horse cannot enter the food chain? Is it the case that some vet are still prescribing this chemical without checking the passport or ensuring that the horse subsequently is signed out of the food chain? She raises a very important point. It is absolutely clear that the horse passport should show that the horse has been  That horse is then not put into the food chain. I, as I have looked at the situation, have become more and more convinced that the horse passport system introduced by the EU and implemented by the last government in this country is actually not as effective as it should be by a long  Once we have dealt with his initial problem, we got to look at the Horse passport situation again.

Some sourced in the UK, some sourced  My concern to put directly to the Minister, where is the testing facility going to be? Is it can acquit? Will the Minister give the House and assurance that there will be adequate testing investment in this country? -- will it be adequate. I am concerned there is a third country importing into the European Union. We have to secure an agreement right across Europe that there will be testing for this chemical right across  The Chief Medical Officer advised that at low levels there is am very low risk indeed that it would cause any harm to health. Nevertheless, we need to eliminate There is very little time and so far exchanges have been too long. We require a model of brevity. I hope we can agree that the Secretary of State has put together one of the biggest operations of its type in the European Union ever to assure a result across the whole of the European Union. Can he confirm that the use of this chemical is grossly exaggerated, it  but not so much as it is  It should not be present in a horsemeat that is presented for human consumption. I honourable friend is absolutely right in saying that the actions that have now been put in place, my right honourable friend is at the moment with Interpol and in the cage securing cord nation in this matter. It is extremely welcome that European authorities are getting to grips with this. It is interesting that the attitude of the Minister has changed since Monday when he was at pains to say there was no risk to public health. It was an issue of Miss labelling and fraud. It is an issue of public health. Given that a very small percentage of carcasses were tested, shouldn't the Minister give an apology to the House? Do what I have repeatedly said is there is no evidence of material which is harmful to human health being put on sale in this  That is still the case. I am very glad that is the case. We are testing for it. That is the prime responsibility of the Food Standards Agency. What worries me at times is that people seem to think food safety is a secondary responsibility, it is not. The Food Standards Agency have been able to contact all the businesses and the retailers affected. One of the raided places was in my constituency. We are examining the paperwork from those companies and I understand some of the paperwork is difficult to interpret. I cannot give a categorical assurance that that is the case. Some of the meet present appeared to be a labelled and therefore destination unknown. The police are taking every action  Does the Minister share my astonishment that Tim Smith, who used to be be chief executive of the food services authority and is now the technical director of Food Standards at Tesco is not only still in his job but on the board of the Food Standards Agency? What I am impressed by is the degree of co-operation we are now receiving from the industry, from all food businesses in this testing regime which we have put in place. We hope to have meaningful results from bat  Who works for which company is not a matter for ministers at this dispatch box but whether we have the results that will assure the public is. The aim -- given the importance of this issue with the Minister join me in calling upon Her Majesty's opposition to walk with the Government in the national interest to sort this issue rather than making cheap party political points? I think that would be a The beef and lamb sourcing system in the United Kingdom is significant. Can the Minister confirm that the costs accrued as regards this horsemeat scandal will not be passed on to farmers or similar organisations? He makes an very serious point which is about the assurance schemes we have in this country, in terms of the traceability of meat and also be the his assurances on top of that through schemes. I think we have every reason to be proud of the  particularly of cut meat in this country, which is the best in this world. Farmers in his region of the country have a leading role to pay in providing  -- the role to play. In 2006 a task force identified the potential problem and made 32 recommendations to deal with  Can the Minister explain to the House caught the last Government did do implement those recommendations? I think it is forbidden for me to give an opinion on the performance of the previous Government in response. He will draw his Honour conclusions from the actions for a lack of actions that took place at that time. In answer to the question from the chair of the Select Committee, the Minister said there was a problem with horse passports and sought to blame the last Labour Government. Did he remember that in January he said to the House the honourable lady thought there was some difficulty with horse passports and I do not think that is the case. Isn't that symptomatic of his rather high-handed attitude which has really irritated people and explains the flat fitness of the Government in this crisis? I do apologise if he is irritated. We are continuing to do the work that are continuing to do the work that  -- flat-footedness. I have been consistent.

Following earlier comments from another member, to the Minister now confirm what action he had taken to deal with this chemical before the member of Wakefield raised this issue on in 24th January? It is an issue which is well-known and which is one of the things that is look for at the point of slaughter. I have also said I think there may be deficiencies in the horse Baz board system which we need to address --  I do not think she is being helpful to a serious discussion on this subject.With all the cheering I did not here. Thank you very much. LAUGHTER. Does the Minister agree with me that what this is all about his exposure of a very significant occasion where the rule of law has been broken? The important thing is to make sure he has discussions with his European colleagues to make sure we bring in mechanisms to stop this happening again, especially making sure the supply train is properly transparent? He summarises the whole position very well. The most important thing is to have effective investigation, find the  and on the basis of that,  Can I ask for a simple answer to a simple question, when is the order that horse carcasses should only be released from abattoirs after they have been found to be clear of this chemical? My honourable friend says helpfully it is in the folder. We have rather a lot of dates in our heads on this unfolding situation. I make no apologies on not being able to give. I cannot find the date on here and I am not going to give the honourable lady a wrong answer and find it later in the session. Looking to the future we have really got to put the consumer at the heart of the food safety. When we bring forward these EU labelling  can we ensure that my constituents can actually understand what is in their food and that they do not need a degree in food science to know what they are eating? I think she raises a really important point which is that food labelling is supposed to help the consumer, not confuse. This is wide what we are trying to do is make sure we have a food labelling system which is accurate and also gives people information which is useful to them and not information which is simply  That is why sometimes there will be talk about excluding information which, frankly, will simply confuse the consumer.

We have requested that, as have France. That is why that is now proceeding. That will at co-ordination to an otherwise fragmented police investigation. It has been reported in the press today that the FSA in Ireland told the UK about concerns in November last year. When were ministers first told about this problem? Perhaps it isn't his fault or if he would care to look.We have said all along that there has co-ordination between the Food Standards Authority N Ireland and  We have also said that the Irish were not operating on the basis of an intelligence led  Therefore it was not prior information.

Confidence in the food supply chain  Retailers bear the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the food they sell. What assurances has see-sawed from retailers about the integrity of the food chain? That is very much the basis of the discussions we have been having of a row last month with them.

He has indicated what is being done at the European  Does he agree with me that it is deeply ironic, in fact profoundly worrying, that at the very time the Government is considering Hamas opt out from European issues? -- a mass opt out. My right honourable friend is leading the request today. Will make sure that on a pan-European basis we deal with what is a pan- European issue. The date in question is Monday 11 February. What my constituents want to know is whether it is safe to eat any processed beef products that are currently on sale. The honourable member for Wakefield has spread huge fears by saying that she would not eat current products on sale. What is the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and independent Food Standards Agency on this matter? The advice is very clear that all the testing that has so far taken place has failed to find evidence of food which is dangerous to human health. Therefore the clear advice is that there is no reason to change shopping habits on the basis of being concerned about  I prefer people to take their own decisions on these matters on the basis of evidence and information. It is an individual decision. I don't think it is helpful for people to pretend there is a massive food scare in terms of health issues if there is  nor to give reassurances that are not supported by evidence. And money is he cannot remember what happened at three days ago. I would like to ask them about a large number of horses in the last year at that were slaughtered in the UK abattoirs for meat.

He asked for that on Monday. The FSA receive the information on  I have here the e-mail exchange between the director of operations at the FSA and the honourable lady were he repeatedly request further information and evidence based on the comments she made in the House. Her reply is that she is anxious to protect her source from any repercussions. She seeks to bargain with the FSA for further information before releasing information. I am happy to put this in the public domain if  I think I comment are  I said that was that. You can pursue these matters him another forum if you wish.

One of the first actions of the Work and Pensions Secretary was to abolish the jobs fund. The Prime Minister said it was one of the most ineffective job schemes there has ever been but another publication by this Government said it was one of the most successful cost-effective schemes ever. Emergency regulations were rushed through the House after the Government's work programme was ruled illegal. For people looking for work what matters to them most is the Work and Pensions assessment of the work programme. It conceded the current scheme was worse than doing nothing.

She will have heard what the Minister for Women and equalities said earlier in questions. The debate this afternoon will be an opportunity to express support and welcome the debate and the focus it rightly gives to this very important issue. I was quite surprised that Harold Wilson was the subject of Channel 4's Valentine's Eve, it was not the obvious choice. But from my own personal point of view I remember him because in 1966 when I was at school there was a meeting addressed by Harold Wilson. That was the good old days. I was politically neutral and the 10 years old! I think we have got to be careful with all these Valentine's Day references. This morning I read the Guardian and an interview with the Leader of the Opposition who, I fear, in telling us about the nature of his Valentine's the evening with a Chinese takeaway and what he described later as a surprise, was providing us with too much information! The honourable lady, I was trying to detect questions about the business, I was not sure where they were.

They have as a party to recognise that if they left us in an economic mess, which is what the head of their economic Review says they have to start apologising for that, it is simply not going to allow them to participate in debates in future  Yesterday they could not participate with credibility.

She makes an important point relating to her constituency. In the midst of the necessity for us to make proper disposal of surplus land we ought to be able to do so in a way that recognises community interests.

The Wilson years give an example of someone who as Prime Minister kept us out of war. He also expanded higher education tremendously. He gave people a choice on Europe.

He will know the Secretary of State and I discussed this filly. It was one of the things I am sure we were right to institute the public inquiry.

But Leader of the House will have heard the chair of the Health Select Committee today talking about gagging orders and the way in which they have been used within the health service. Would he make time for a debate when the this House can discuss making it a criminal offence to put in a gagging order into a contract but is guaranteed to be against public safety?When the House has an opportunity to debate the Francis inquiry, that will be a relevant consideration. I made it very clear and the chief executive of the NHS made it clear that gagging clauses would not be put into NHS contracts.

The reason why this particular subject has been chosen by me to mark today's debate is because activists in the 1 billion rising campaign around the country have run workshops about what would make the most difference. Actually quite a lot of things have been done about domestic violence. We have better Prosecutions, refugees and things like that to help victims of domestic violence, but those workshops concluded that the most important thing to do was to make the next generation safe.

Of course there are schools which are doing this well. The problem is we do not have a comprehensive system, and I will go into the details  which guarantees excellent sex and relationships education, and it is unsafe not to have a The ONS estimates that over 500,000 people will be victims of sexual crimes in an average year, with 000 prosecutions. Does that not said that there needs to be wider education, so that people can protect themselves? Clearly this state is failing to protect them. The police response to this issue has improved, let's be honest. It is better than it used to be but it is not good enough. The honourable lady is right, that in any crime, usually the police only detect something like two or 3% of their crimes that occur, and even less lead to prosecutions. It is not completely unusual in that regard. The best response is to prevented him the first place. My argument is that taking on this challenge of teaching against violence is one of the ways of preventing it. I used to be an educator. I used to teach children in primary school, and then I'd talk about to be teachers. I know that good quality education transforms lives. I also know that  this subject is an afterthought into many schools. Let's look at this from first  Is it necessary to act? Will be action proposed make a difference? What will happen if this does not? The British crime Survey shows that one in 14 women and one in 20 men interviewed in 2011/12th had experienced domestic abuse by a partner or family member in the last year. Nearly one in three women and one in five men said they had experienced such abuse since the age of 16. Eight Freedom of Information request made by my right honourable friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford suggested that one third of 999 calls about domestic violence are from those who had been previous victims.

It is striking. One of the things that I have been doing in preparation is looking at research about whether sex and relationships education actually  One of the things that that research shows is that there is further to go with boys and girls. That is something we should take very seriously. We really need to address the level of tolerance which young boys seem to have towards violence, seeing it as relatively normal. We do not know  If I keep giving way I'm going to take up too much of his debates will I'm going to try to  If any member is really assertive I would give way, Halle about that? The research shows that young men have a higher tolerance of sexual violence than young women.

Of the lessons they observed which were  they noticed that the bed that was not so good was relationships education. What we have done is we have create its an education system which focuses much too much on the mechanics of sex, and not sufficiently on autonomy, on the right to say no, on positive relationships, on empowering young people in its way. -- in this way. I commend the evidence said to us by the PSHE Association, who recall something like 40% of students, 16- 18-year-old, could not remember information on sexual consent. Only 6% of respondents said that they got the information on relationships that they needed in  They point out that good quality PSHE teaching not only helps to raise young people's awareness of abuse, but supports awareness of those who experience abused to develop practical strategies and skills to stop it. It challenges prevailing negative attitudes towards women and girls.

I asked my local police commander whether there was the same problem of young girls being exploited by organised gangs, who seduce them with violence and bullying and presents and threats?

We need it to be able to allow boys to know that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable and the whole of society, even if it happens be closed doors. We need it to make sure that people who have been victims of violence know that it is not their fault. If we can make a society in which all of those things are real, which I believe excellent sex and relationships education based on zero-tolerance to environments will actually deliver, we are still miles behind. Zero tolerance to  Many groups reports students still facing sexual bullying and violence as a norm in colleges and universities. I think  was that implemented, could make a difference.

I figured is important that we hear the voices in this debate. I am welcoming the Minister to his position to take advantage of this particular session. I want to talk about what we have done already. I am very proud of the home secretary. I know that may not be a statement that receives wide cross-party support but we have taken some very important steps. We have provided stable funding for those who are supporting victims of violence.

It seems to me we are conducting a long-term experiment with our children, particularly our girls and young  in exposing them to the sorts of violent and degrading and often very sexual icon -- content in an online world. When young people are going to look at third party content on websites, and I may be classified as the new Mary  with the support of members across the House we have made extraordinarily good progress in bringing the internet service providers to a point where they are going to introduce filters that provide protection took all devices in the home. We are looking at dealing with protection for children and families with children  We have only four out of ten families with children using filters at the moment, six out of ten at live without filters. Public Wi-Fi will be in a situation where we have to filter off adult content by the end of this year, and the mobile phone providers are refreshing their own adult content. Then honourable lady for Slough has worked tirelessly on this. I recognise the excellent work she has been doing. It is she also concerned about the games consoles and the violence that is often depicted there? There is where going on to put age ratings on games and also online music videos. Maybe I am prudish, but some of the things one sees in the gym is not what I would want my children to  In terms of the third party  Britain will be leading the world in terms of the way we protect our families. However, there is us second bucket of problems often related to it as user generated content, basically young children exchanging imagery and content of been appropriate messages themselves.

They're often the kind of neglected children that Action for children talk about  Children that feels so lacking in self-esteem that they welcome at any attention, and have no understanding of what a caring relationship is because they have never seen one. Often these children's neglect goes undetected. You can see why they are vulnerable to sexual grooming, and how important it is to identify them in their early childhood. I am very impressed with Stockport's programme which enables referrals to all councils and other local services to be recorded on a single shared database, so that a complete picture of a child's life can be built up and they can be early detection of children who are  At the moment children have to reach certain threshold for services they are referred to, and often that threshold is reached far too late in a child's life.

Without them, I fear there would be more tragic  We want a better world, where victims are not afraid to  and where perpetrators cannot rely on the silence of their  It is very good to see the support from all sides of the House for this excellent motion from the Member for Slough. Each of us are trying to make a difference, and One Billion Rising cannot be wrong. It is tradition on these occasions to be a lone voice, but in fact it is customary in most debates for me to be a lone voice! I intend to continue that tradition today. We are all united in our opposition to any violence against women and  I would be a standard if any of us were not. By -- as standard. I am one of the most hardline people when it comes to matters of law and order and sentencing people. I find it strange when those people speak so passionately on many things I agree with, about how we should have a zero tolerance to any kind of violence against people, and then be the same people or argue that the perpetrators back -- of violence should do anything but be sent to prison. We are in the ridiculous situation that in this country people convicted of violence against a person, on the 35% of men a sent to prison and only 17% of women. If we want to send out a message of zero tolerance towards violence against  the first thing we ought to be doing it is pressing for much tougher sentences for people who are guilty of those things. It would be a better way than the Education route or the Member for Slough things will solve all of these problems. Is the honourable gentleman saying we should never try to prevent crime, or intervene and try to indicate an divert people from crime, but we should just wait to -- until they commit a crime and then lock them up as long as possible? Actually for many  the respite from the violence is when the perpetrator is sent to be present. But is one of the best deterrents to be violence  -- that is one. Sending people to prison is one of the best things we can do. It seems already that honourable members opposite or less than keen on zero tolerance to violence than they seem to save from their rhetoric. You could be forgiven for thinking that the main victims of violent crime of women  and that this does not of pride to women -- men or boys. I pointed out the Minister for justice that the reality of these matters is sometimes very different from the rhetoric which we hear  I asked him -- her whether she accepted my figures were  Her reply seemed to indicate she thought they were  Given that these but Ministry for justice's own figures, Does he understand that the vast majority of incidents is against women and girls do not get anywhere near the criminal-justice system? I do not disagree, but I want to quote the most recent by any of statistics on the representation of females and males in the criminal Justin's -- justice system. Men are twice as likely to be a victim of violent crime than women. 2% of women interviewed in the crime Survey for England and Wales reported been victims of violence compared to 4% of men. They also confirm that all incidents of violence reported in the survey, 62% of victims were male and 30%  I cannot give weight because time is limited and I have already given to interventions. There will be plenty of opportunity for intervention Slater. This also applies to children. According to the statistics, a smaller proportion of girls reported been victims of violence than boys. 5% of girls but the 11% of boys. Women accounted for between 27-32% of all recorded homicide victims between 2006/7 and 2010/11, while men were between 68 and 73% of cases, too. In terms of domestic violence, women are more likely to be victims.

I think they definitely are  To the total cost of domestic abuse services in the criminal justice system amounts to something in the order of £3.8 billion per year. It is clear that to prevent violence against women  we need to do more to ensure both young men and young women are educated to develop positive and equal relationships with their peers. This education will start in Scholes, statutory personal relationship education and early intervention will help change attitudes and behaviour towards domestic violence. Schools need to play a key role in educating both boys and girls, that violence in relationships is completely  I urge the Government to make sex and relationships education at statutory and standardise. I want to speak in that time left to an issue which is,  an absolute catastrophe. The issue of female genital  It is a scandal in my  Mr Deputy Speaker. The Government estimates that approximately 20,000 under 15-year- olds are at risk from this practice  That is more than 50 young female victims every day. It is important to point out that this is motivated only by the need to control women, bullying, the most grotesque abuse towards women. Female genital mutilation has been a criminal offence since 1985. But it is shocking in my view but we have not seen one single prosecution yet. We have seen some positive steps in recent months, with the CPS refocusing on this  and I welcome the publication of its action plan. But to eradicate this practice we need cross department work involving the Home Office, Department for  to partner for Health, the Foreign Office, and proper  We need to secure justice for these victims, and in my  prosecuting it will prevent future of victims of this despicable criminality.

I welcome the Home Secretary's commitment to looking very closely at Updating our data to make sure we are recording in the NHS. A I agree entirely with the honourable lady's comments she --. She has done a lot of work in this area. She chairs the all-party Parliamentary Group on this issue. One final point in that time I have left if I may. The Metropolitan Police project was set up to tackle this problem. But a Freedom of Information request showed that the team consists of just one full-time police officer and one part-time police officer to tackle the issue of female genital mutilation across the country. It simply is ridiculous to suggest that this is sufficient policing, and I welcome the work but the Home Secretary has done in that this  But we need more resources in my submission to police this most disgusting violence against women and young girls.

I will say that I think the initial point made was absolutely  I was about to finish before I gave way, I know colleagues want to speak so I will  As a former police victim of examiner I have seen women in the middle of the night who have been deeply traumatised in the immediate aftermath of horrific sexual violence. And also women in their eighties and nineties who are still suffering a lifetime of consequences. There is nothing new about sexual violence, but what has changed is the normalisation if you like and acceptance of sexual violence within our society. This is something we have to address. I am very proud to be a patron of the Devon and rape crisis, and I welcome the £40 million that has gone towards setting up and make work of rape crisis centres. When I was a victim Examiner, but was not  I pay tribute to... Very quickly, I am absolutely shocked that you suggest that it is a normalisation of violence. Could you define what you mean. I want to hear what the lady has to say. I will come on to that, but before I finished I would like to pay tribute to the 27 remarkable  skilled volunteer women working for Devon make crisis in my  -- rape crisis. By normalisation, I mean for example the fact that 18% -- 80% of 15 to 17-year-olds by now regularly accessing hard core pornography. To my mind that constitutes a normalisation, it it is being accessed by 80% of them. The issue being referred to by my honourable friend for Devizes about the extent to which we seek sexual texting, and the extent to which it is going  another example, when I go into the tea rooms in the House of Commons and icy colleagues having newspapers -- I see colleagues with newspapers with images that objectify women, a find  It is a normalisation that across the country young girls are sitting in households where they see this as a normal portrayal  People may find me  but I assured members there is nothing that makes me blush! It is not blushes, it is  That this is what I would turn up on normalisation. I hope I have answered my honourable friend's question. Thank you for explaining it! What I would say it I feel we need is three things. We need challenge, we need to challenge the normalisation of secularisation and violence towards  -- sex realisation. That has to be as part of education. But it has to be the right education, and I would ask the front bench to respond to the need to make much greater use of peer educators. It is no use having a teacher who is embarrassed and blushes about talking about sex and sexual  sometimes the best educators are peer educators which have often been victims who are prepared to talk about the impact this has had on their lives. And of course let us see the right people, which includes families. As my honourable friend points out, it is right for parents to be aware of what their children are accessing. Just have a look, and do not be embarrassed to talk to your children and talk and challenge We need to look at how we encourage women to report crimes. I know from direct experience, how brave women direct experience, how brave women have to be to come forward. What I found disappointing is the acceptance in some quarters that women should not be encouraged to report these crimes. But somehow, this amounts to a collusion with a process that says, don't report. We need to challenge, we need to  That support comes,  through the work of rape crisis and the professionals that work with them support services throughout the country. Let's see challenge, reporting and an end to normalisation and an improvement in support through the criminal justice system to make sure that those who perpetrate such a crimes against women absolutely no that they have to pay for these  On the day that we celebrate love and romance, I am glad to be taking part in this  which seeks to make sure that no one should ever be subject to a mentally or physically abusive relationship. Can I congratulate the backbench business committee on securing this debate.

A girl of nine has given birth in Mexico and was just eight years old when she became pregnant. 25 years ago, it was not considered an offence to rape within marriage. 603 million women currently live in countries where domestic violence is not considered a crime. In my own  which I hold weekly, one of my first cases was a girl who came to me and her mother, who were convinced her sister had died through domestic violence but it had not been recognised by police.

I am a practising barrister, practising for many years in the field of crime and domestic  I have seen many lives ruined by domestic violence. Early in 2011 I became aware of the limitations of the Protection from harassment Act, which gave rise to the parliamentary inquiry. The panel drew membership from a crossbow houses, and across the political spectrum. We looked into the adequacy of the law, and took written evidence during which we sought the views of legal experts, practitioners, campaign groups and  We concluded that the then nor was not fit for purpose, and recommended that practices should  Within one month of our report's publication, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would be implementing our recommendations, and that new clauses to this effect were passed by both houses in only 11 days.

What does he think about the Welsh Government's proposals to bring forward a Bill on domestic abuse, and whether he thought there was a lot of potential there for taking concrete action on this issue? The Welsh Government of very proactive on these issues, and I am delighted to hear they are taking action. As of November of last year, stalking is an named offensive in the Laws of England and Wales. The new law is split into sections which have been added to the protection of harassment Act, namely an offence punishable by up to 52 weeks in prison or a fine, as well as on a fence involving stocking which prompts fear of violence or alarm  -- stalking. This is punishable both by the Crown Court and Manchester's court. We thought it of the utmost importance for the law to take notice of the fact that threats to those suffering stalking or not almost physical. -- not always physical. I would have argued that violence itself is not always physical. The Oxford English Dictionary defines violence as treatment or usage, attending to cause bodily injury or forcibly interfering with personal freedom.

The honourable member for Walthamstow has been so passionate about bringing to our attention but One Billion Rising campaign. I have come our way a little bit jaundiced as a result of my experience about the ability to change things solely by education. In the 25 years that female genital mutilation has been illegal in this country, there have been virtually no referrals through the education system, and it is difficult to get people to talk about it through education. Recently a senior local Government leader admitted that when she went to train her teachers in her local authority about training on a female genital mutilation in  many point-blank refused to teach it was a crime and felt they were infringing on people's cultural values. I have a note of caution on whether we can rely solely on the idea that we have to do its through a multi-agency  As opposed whilst I will support the motion of course, my note of caution is, let us not give the message that we think that is the only answer. We know that there is so much more to it. It might be part of the answer, and I know the Minister will talk more about what is going on, but it is not a Silverburn it. There are lots of other things we need to do. -- our silver bullet. I also want to thank the Home Office because in November at 27 I spoke about the Dutch health passport and in less than one here -- November 2011, in less than a year they brought our own version of the Dutch health  our statement against female genital mutilation, vintages. I was speaking to a campaigner who is taking it to Germany to get their Government to adopt it. Popping -- hopefully this will have a ripple effect across Europe. People have said it is it really a passport? Are saying, no it is an empowerment document. I hope this document will empower some of the girls who have already been through female genital mutilation to help their little sister's, have to say to extended family members, you are not going to do to my little sister what you are going to do it to me. So I see this very much as a way of empowering Gells to help protect  which I think today is an appropriate thing to talk about. The honourable member referred to two constituents of mine, one was the tragic case of the lady who died in this terrible circumstances and with all this terrible sex  and the other incident, --  a little girl, I spoke to her mother this morning, and she be emphasised how horrendous to widespread this problem was of sexual texting and sexual imagery going on in schools.

Can I add my congratulations to the members whose secured today's debate and the lady member -- honourable lady from Slough. The One Billion Rising campaign reminds us that one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime. Today is an opportunity to commend the people who are refusing to accept the status Croll and a working to support the victims of sexual violence and working to change laws, attitudes and institutions which perpetuate these abuses of power board here and internationally. On a day when we celebrate nothing relationships. We should highlight how sexual violence blights our lives. Violence against women affects us all indirectly and directly, whatever our age or religion. I am sure that most of us will either have experienced agenda based violence or know a friend or relative who has full-stop -- gender are based violence.

In this subject of sexual and physical violence not equal and around the world, here also, but especially in the developing world, we live through and we are witnessing a shameful prevalence of violence against women and girls, which have a duty to tackle.

Of course it gives rise to a challenge for all of us to take responsibility for the other impacts of globalisation which are not so visible or so immediately and directly seem to be our responsibility. But we have to take both sides of it together. But, Mr Deputy speaker, my main point is here in the UK it is a serious  We have seen in recent decades an epidemic or sexual crime.

I congratulate the sponsors of this and those speaking this afternoon on this important topic. Thank you, Mr Deputy speaker for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I would like to congratulate those who secured this debate and so far those who have contributed into this debate. It's great to follow the member for Mid-Norfolk at this time. It is  which is close to the heart of many present here, those who are not present, they still support it. The incident in New Dellly unfortunately led to the -- New Delhi unfortunately led to the death of a 23-year-old woman, named by the people of India - the brave hearted daughter of India. She was brutally gang-raped by a group of men on a public bus. She suffered from various injuries which severely damaged both her brain and body and as a result of this inhuman act she died on 29th  2012. This particular act of violence has sparked much anger  Here in the UK and across the world and it is part of the reason why I stand here to discuss the subject of violence against women and girls. Over the last few  two vigils in my constituency, and outside the Indian High Commission, was able to witness the hundreds of people brought to hear their anger against the perpetrators of such a despicable act and which were all present this afternoon at the parliamentary square to support those people who were campaigning against the violence.

Too often our female colleagues are left and to have  I am pleased that a male colleague will answer on behalf of the Government today. I want to make some short comment on this debate.

I hope the issue of child pornography can be dealt with by taking action against the provider's. I also would like the curriculum to be updated for. I am grateful for inviting me to speak in this important debate. It shows the House at its best. As we make our voices count in this One Billion Rising Campaign, we recognise that we cannot achieve this without changing wider ideas in society. We need to educate and safe guards young people. Alongside this immediate need that has been discussed for those exposed to violence and abuse, attitudes are very prevalent in our society that need to be examined. As technology  so too does the measure and the means of sexual exploitation. Arrie young people are particularly at vulnerable. We know that recent cases of systematic child grooming involving violence and often sadistic  such as those in Rochdale  serve to show how necessary it is to give our young people the knowledge and resources to stop these situations happening  Many young and vulnerable teenage girls in particular are targeted and abused by offenders  Young people need to understand that they cannot consent to their own abuse and their own  The way to do this is to reflect consistently through law-enforcement agencies, support services and education services that is not the case.

She is absolutely  The models we grow up with reflect the way it we engage with the wider world. One of my concerns is that young people subjected to see in this kind of abuse in their own circumstances don't go on to perpetuate that violence in later life.

This education is needed across the  not simply targeted at a grip that we would, in other way, demon a vulnerable. I appreciate the views of members across this House who feel, just as I do, that sex is a spiritual as well as emotional and physical act. To deny young people to the education and the capacity to prevent themselves from finding themselves in that situation in the first place I conclude is a perverse outcome of  Education targeting the prevention of violence against women and girls is not only an issue for women and girls.

I would like to pay tribute to the Shadow Home Secretary for promoting and getting behind the One Billion Rising  Many members across the House today have spoken with passion about the importance of ending violence against women. When I was a new MP, I was told of a wonderful football team called Hull  I was told the capacity of their stadium would be felled with all the victims of domestic violence in the city. I thought that was quite a stark statistic to show that domestic violence is still so prevalent in all our The honourable member spoke about the Strength To Change campaign, which worked with perpetrators. It worked with the men. It worked with 250 perpetrators to try and get behaviour changed. Of course, those men had already engaged in domestic  I think all members of the House will agree it's better to stop that happening by getting in early and making sure that our young men and women understand what's acceptable in relationships and that violence is never, ever  The current position, as we have heard, is that the education that we give to young people in schools is very limited.

I actually have to say, I'm very respectful of the minister sitting on the front bench, but I am disappointed that the Home Secretary is not sitting there  The reason for that is because I understand she chairs the violence against women sub  I know that the Home Secretary has particularly spoken out against violence against women and girls on many occasions.

Since then, I have been chasing the Department for Education to see what they are going to do next. I have put in many parliamentary questions. I have asked lots of questions about, are the ministers meeting lots of groups and organisations to make sure they get this right? It seems very little has happened. The honourable member just spoke about who she thought should be on the  Is she disI pointed,  that none of those Education Ministers are sitting  One of the Education Ministers was just in and unfortunately is not here to hear the rest of the debate. I think the Department of Education are actually the villains in this actual event today because there is general acceptance across the house that PHSE being made statutory is not the complete answer, but it is part of the jigsaw. It fits very well with what the Government are saying in terms of the steps they have taken since they have come to power and the Labour Government  in trying to address violence against women and trying to equip our youngsters with the skills and knowledge they need to make good choices about the lives  I am disappointed that the Department for Education are not hear to list on the the debate.

I want to thank the leadership from members from  Walthamstow and compelling speeches from all sides of the  I was struck by the speeches from the member for Totnes and also from Mid-Norfolk. Notwithstanding  I share the disappointment which has been expressed about the lack of vigour from the Government front bench. When I asked my question to the minister about the importance of statutory education when it comes to PHSE and violence against women and girls - the response was, it's voluntary, schools can do it if they want to. Everything we have heard in this debate this afternoon suggests this approach is not enough. Does she agree with me that there's a problem in that PHSE is not part of the curriculum in academies and free schools. We've all agreed during the debate this is a problem across society. I would agree with those who mentioned earlier we need a whole-school approach. Yes, it is  but it has to be vital through all other parts of the education system. The figure are  60,000 women are raped  Two women a week are killed by a partner or ex-partner. This culture of violence I think is doing enormous damage to our young  For example, as the honourable member found this sexing is linked to coercion behaviour and bullying and has a disproportionate impact on girls. Over 70% of 16-18- year-old boys and girls said they heard sexual name-calling towards girls at schools. One in three girls said they experienced groping or other unwanted sexual touching  In a report published  entitled "I thought I was the only one," the commission found in six months, 16,000  mainly girls were at risk of sexual exploitation. We need to ask why so many males, young and old think it is acceptable to treat girls and boys as objects to be used and abused. That comes to the key point - violence does not happen in a vacuum. We have to recognise wider culture. Today, I want to focus on one aspect of that - the objectivefyation of women in  Women have been served up as sex objects in some of our daily newspapers for many years. These show images which would be prohibited on television and are sold without any age restriction in  often at a child's eye level. As a mother of two sons there are shops I would rather not go in to because of they-level material they  Every week we read cases of women killed by their partner or former partner. Everyone should cause an outcry, but rarely warrant a paragraph because they are becoming routine. The problem was highlighted by women's groups who gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and later published a  This shows how homicide cases are reported as tragic one- off incidents, rather than a well- understand palttern of behaviour. How rape -- pattern. Of how cases of rape are placed next to images of naked women. How those are explained in terms of culture,  but anything other than violence against women and girls.

The chief prosecution for London has expressed concern about the impact that the treatment of women in the media has on rape cases and jurors' decision makes. She believes they are coming to court with preconceptions about women. She says "If a girl goes out and gets drunk and falls over, they are demonised in the media. If they become a victim, you can see how jurors would bring their preconceptions to bear." Much- needed work is being done with detectives and prosecutors to dispel myths about women who have  She asked and I quote, "is There something more we should  so when people come on to jury service they are not challenged for the first time?" the answer is, of  yes. That is why our schools need to be taking a lead. That is why work to pro-vent violence must be an integral part of education, delivered in every  In 2010, 40% of 16-18-year- olds said either they did not receive lessons or information on sexual consent or they didn't know whether they did. While the education must now teach about  it needs to go further and include all forms of violence against women, including teenage relationship abuse, forced marriage and sexual exploitation. It should work on gender equality otherwise young women and men will never be exposed to education and designed to reduce gender violence and designed to counter cultural factors such as the media. The one billion women want a world to empower women. Work in our schools must allow young people to be more in control of their sexual identity. And cuerblgly, it must address harmful nations of masculinity and present boys with alternatives. The deputy children's commission has spoken out about the impacts of young men's sexual aggressive  While there is negative impacted of porn on their attitude  The domestic abuse charity Rise, is an existing good  It delivers a preventative programme on healthy relationships to schools across the  Our schools subscribe to the whole-school approach, recommended by the coalition, where heads take  teachers are trained on the issues and all students receive sexual education which deals with equality and respect.

Two wiment killed every week in the UK. -- women killed every week in the UK. Worldwide acts of violence against women and girls aged 15-44 cause more death and disability than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents and war combined. Over 53% of children five to 18 in India have been sexually abused. 57% of Australian women reported violence in their lifetime. 728,000 recorded by our police in 2010,  Only 8% of those cases ending successfully in prosecution. 45% of women in the UK have experienced  It's no wonder that one billion women are rising today, because as Kathi Letts said, women are always runners up in the human  The statistics are shocking and possibly challengable. It is not enough with those statistics to be horrified. We have to do  A study of boys to men, the study called Boys to Men, found among year nine pupils. 47% of boys thought it was already to hit their partners in certain circumstances T Girl Guide's attitude survey found 39% of girls and 49% of boys thought it was already to make you tell your boyfriend where you are all the time. 21% of girls and 39% of boys thought it is already to tell your girlfriend what to wear. 2% of girls and 1% of boys thought it was -- 11% of boys thought it was already to hit somebody if they spoke to someone at a party. Domestic violence is about power. It is about control of your partner and about how women are viewed in  Think back to those traditional marriage vows that start with who gives this woman to  And ends up with women proming to obey T vows have been updated N so many cases attitudes have not. If we want to change attitudes, we need good sex and relationship education in schools. We girls and boys to be confident, to have good  We need girls to be assertive and not accept that they have to do what they are told to by their partner. Think about where young people currently get much of their education about sex and relationships. OK, some may come from parents, but much more from peers and pornography. When I worked with young people I was horrified by the publications they were reading and the films they were watching. Porn does not talk about loving relationships, it does not talk about waiting until you are ready to have sex. It talks about taking women, rough sex, about women as sexual objects to be  I was shocked when one young woman told me about being with a girl of -- group of girls and boys in the bedroom. This boy was masturbating while in full view of  This was deemed to be appropriate behaviour. Perfectly  I have worked with many victims of domestic violence, including colleagues. Domestic violence robs the victim of confidence and self-esteem. Victims are told it is their fault, if they were a better cook, cleaner, this would not be happening to you. But this reality is, whatever they  however they behaved, the violence would still happen. Because in the end, that partner becomes the whipping boy. The outlet for frustration and anger.  I only do it because I study showed that 12% of year 11 and 12 pupils thinks that boy friends who hit girlfriends deserve a second chance. That is far too often the start of a journey into long-term domestic abuse. Abuse is psychological, threatening and  The perpetrator makes it impossible for the victim to maintain relationships with family and friends. The fear or of the perpetrator does not disappear if you manage to walk out. That is why refugees don't publish addressees and women often need to live many miles away from their support  Relationships are fundamental to our society. Too often we have relationships not built on equality, mutual trust and mutual respect. The very least we can do in a civilised society is to give young people information, skills and values to build positive and equal relationships. Thank you. I would like to thank the backbench business committee for selecting this important debate. And also congratulate my honourable friend for eloquently leading this debate. I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on domestic violence against women in  I have been dealing with the woman's aid project in my constituency. They tell me that domestic violence against women in our communities is still for the most part hidden away and never really openly spoken about. Why would this be? We have heard a mixture of reasons. Not least the fear of talking openly about it. And the shame that they feel, that somehow they have brought the violence on themselves, which is not the case. The real shame is that society still allows this to happen in their own homes. In my own part of the country, in  they tell me and domestic violence incident is recorded every  Imagine that in the time of this debate. No one deserves to be abused. No one should have to put up with abuse. Not even in their own home. Domestic abuse can affect any woman regardless of class, race or age. There is no typical abuser either. 82% of incidents involve men attacking women that they profess  Three women a-week are killed by a former or current  Many are not attacked for the first time. 33,000 victims have already experienced domestic abuse.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this important debate  I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Slough for initiating it. It is asked shocking statistic that last year the Government estimates 85,000 women were raped or sexually  Clearly, this violence takes place in a cultural context. I want to build on the remarks of the honourable member for Totnes for -- to suggest some concrete things we might do to shift this  which is betraying women in such a highly sexual lies way. It seems to me that in my adult life women have made lots of progress in many respects. Progress  progress in terms of education and public services, progress in terms of pensions and  We seem to have gone backwards in this India of the public portrayal of women and the impact that is having won our self- esteem and on the way men treat  The all-party group on body image looked at women's attitudes to their bodies.

I think we need to seriously take some concrete steps and move this Today we are seeing what is called a feminist tsunami around the world. And there are 160 events across the  203 countries around the world joining in to say "enough".

Women and men coming together to say they do not want to live in a world where one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime. In turning the 1 billion women who would be assaulted into 1 billion people calling for change. Has the British Parliament done justice to that court? I have to say, listening to the debate today, I think we have. We have had a range of contributions which affect women safety in British society and internationally. Many members, have talked about the prevalence of domestic violence in our society. About how we tackle that. Others have highlighted the issues within minority communities and addressing the concept that this is a control issue when gender violence, is gender violence. And I thank the members by highlighting this. We need to express the need for international solidarity. We have talked about forced marriage. But also about how we need to tackle the issues that a peer across the  It the member speaking out for people who we need to stand by. We can improve the way our criminal justice system works.

Also a member for Stockport who highlighted what we can go around the child protection system. The lack of awareness about sexual violence among still people. And the member from Liverpool Wavertree with the sobering statistics that one in five calls to the police are domestic violence calls. Something has to change in British society. We have covered the broader cultural issues. The impact of body  A member for Brighton Pavilion talking about the object of vocation of women in society.

The Member for devise as he made a fantastic contribution in telling the police that when you have so many people standing up in the UK Parliament saying they want change, you do not move them on. She has been a fantastic champion to tackle the needs for the way online technology is allowing change to  They are all examples of a broader issues. It is not about the technology or the practice about F  it is about living in a society that is an equal. And then that influences and impacts on the safety of women in our society. Even if the internet did not exist, women it would still skies this scale of violence unless you tackle the root cause of inequality. Unless we take the stand we are  every day, to say something has to change. That is what the smoke action speaks do. Can I tribute the Member for Slough who has championed this with the backbench committee. And the Member for Hastings, who has also been supportive of this. I want to say why we think this matters on our side of the House. We would like to help the Minister, if he is brave enough to stand up and listen to the arguments about compulsory sex and education is so intrinsic. Many members have talked about the impact her of quality sex and relationships education makes. We know from other work from the Brook Advisory Service about the impact of poor-quality teaching, it is and need for guidance in schools. I commend the work of Women's aid in this regard as well. Another member put her finger on it when she talked about education being no villains of the peace. I agreed. Somebody who like me as campaign to be education to be a key part of tackling debtor within our society. If we can teach our children about a compound interest, why can't we teach them about consent. It is a critical part of this process. The Member for Bolton West talked about youth work and she is right in the way in which we make sure it is not just in schools, but in a whole culture approach. I want to pick up what is a MEN -- well-meant attitude from other members, who seemed to suggest half of the debate for women. Let me tell them, it is not a response a deep of women to avoid violence. It is the responsibility of society to stamp  We welcome you hear too take part in this debate because it is a matter for everyone in society to tackle these issues. For everyone to say, it must not happen. I also hope those members will help to challenge not just those who tried to suggest this is about what  I would urge people to look again at the advice that is given on foreign Office website still see what message that sends out about rape. It is not acceptable to offer a caution as a challenge for a rape in our society will stop we have to tackle the way which we deal with rape.

It is also to go to this issue a group of members I talked about, about the importance of sex and relationship education in schools. We know children will get there by from some were. We note they will  We know the impact it has in not just baby at in terms to  but it with relationships. In how to have a respect for relationship. That it is how we cannot avoid this question. We must challenge those people who are looking to stop it. I would challenge the Secretary of State for Education when he seems to suggest that what we need to do is raise educational attainment. As though sexual behaviour is not happening in the schools that are attaining biased. This is not about  Let me be clear, the Secretary of State said to the Education Select Committee, one of the best ways we can get children not to indulge in risky behaviour is to educate them so well that they have hope in the future. He seems to think it is about raising standards in schools rather than taking on these aspects about what people think is acceptable.

There would be cross-party support to the Home Office Minister if he chooses to say he will take on those people in the education department, who could not be bothered to come here today to talk about this issues. Who are not willing to support it. It is key to tackling the root causes of these problems, to say it is enough,  We must not let these people get in the way of changing the attitudes, because at one is  1 billion rising is because 1 billion is too many.

To usual Twitter account in that way is fantastic. But we will hold to account every day of these issues do not become resolved. I am asking members to vote for this motion, to give the Home Office ministers the very clear support they need. I am going to wrap up because I know whether people want to speak. I am asking members across the House to give the Home Office the evidence they need that this has to change, to go to the Department of Education and to say we want to see sex and relationship education on the curriculum.

And so 1 billion rising is not just one  it is the start of something different in British society. Can I congratulate these members who bid for this debate. It is an excellent idea and well done to the backbench business committee for setting aside the time. Not just for this debate, but for the debate which follows along the same theme of sexual violence. The House will be able to hear shortly from the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon. I did just think the honourable lady opposite spoilt the debate. It had been a very good debate and I listen to speeches on bedsides of  some very powerful ones. From the opposition party and other benches as well. I thought her tone at the end soured what was an excellent debate. I am sorry the honourable lady, the Member for Kingston upon Hull North finds my presence disappointing. I did think that both she and the honourable lady opposite were churlish about the Department education. The Minister for children and families was here for part of the debate. He found the time to come and listened. We have spoken about these issues previously and have done so this  The idea there is somehow divide in the Government is an issue which I think they cling to  But it is a false one.

The references in the House about the importance of securing a prosecution in that area. That is something the CPS want to lead on with their action plan. The Home Office will continue to work with the DPP on removing barriers to get successful prosecutions. The declaration signed on behalf of the Home Office has also been signed by the Minister for families. Ministers from a number of government departments are focused on these issues and focus on delivering progress. The characterisation of the Department for Education is, I think, unfair. Another member spoke about destocking offences. They came into effect last November. Police and prosecutors have been given special guidance and training and I hope they will make a real impact in dealing with what can be a very serious offence which was previously not well dealt with in the criminal justice system. As my time comes rapidly to an end, I shall give way. There was a recent cross-party inquiry into unwanted  We called for statutory provision for or sex and relationships education. Will he comment on that? Let me answer that. I had not been aware of the particular inquiry she had been working on until she spoke. Now I am aware of it. Let me come back to  if I will be allowed to, as sex education is a statutory responsibility. Even in schools where sex and relationships education is taught, and where personal and social health education is taught, many members said it was not a high quality. It is not enough to focus on this being talked, but it is important this is well taught. There was a charity referenced in Brighton which works in partnership with  Some of the partnership working with schools and non- governmental organisations is very important with education. Let me give way and then I shall bring my remarks to conclusion. Sex and relationships education is not compulsory in schools and there is no requirement to teach zero- tolerance in schools. The legislation available before the last election that the current education secretary personally blocked would have made it possible for him to require to zero tolerance to be taught in schools. Can he give me any reason at all why he is a posing it today? Getting good teaching in schools is  I am not sure the Ritchie is setting out is valid.

I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to  It has been excellent. I am grateful to members for pointing out that sex and relationships education based on zero-tolerance to violence might be part of the  but is by no means all of the solution.

Male victims are even more chronically under reported and face extreme its  Almost non-existent access to services. It is almost impossible to estimate the scale of abuse which is still largely unreported and UN recorded. I hope the House will forgive me if I focus my remarks many issues relating to women in conflict. This is not to suggest that the abuse suffered by males are less grave, but it is not my area of expertise.

And into we start to see violence against women as the lawful, we won't be able to develop our development goals of prevention and stabilisation. I will give way. Indeed she deserves great credit for having tabled at this very important motion today. Not least because of the punchy is making that girls and women are at the forefront of violence in the areas she has identified. It is the reason many programmes around the world specifically combat violence against women. Does she agree it is a duty to the Government's -- due to the Government and the Foreign Secretary's credit they have but this item on the agenda for the G8 meeting in Britain later this year? And that helps build on the international agreements she has mentioned which tackle this subject? I do indeed. I thank him for his intervention and the points  I know he was a great champion of women's rights when he was in his role. I know when the Foreign Secretary does become he will update us on progress with the G8 on this issue. I would also like to emphasise another point in relation to this issue, and that is, even in face of statistics and stories which tell us that the women are the most vulnerable to the worst human rights abuses any of us can imagine, they are still more than that. The women I have met have included a Colombian journalist who won't stop challenging arms-dealing in her  despite being abducted, tortured and raped by paramilitaries, and then told there would be no prosecutions in her case budgie could have bodyguards or a ticket out of the country. Or another survivor who speaks are continually about the abuses in her  The story she told still haunts me and a demonstrates the practical solutions are not just Western follies that tinker at the  but they are exactly what those who survived sexual violence are calling for.

How do you stand being made to watch while someone rips your  mother or your sister? It is better to die than that. They use rape as a weapon. Now the women who raped are pregnant and they are unacceptable in their families. Most of them did not tell anyone they had been raped because of the stick enough. If there is no  if there is no law, then everything has collapsed. We cannot stop women's violence, we cannot  we cannot stop any kind of sexual violence towards women. We need justice. I am a representative of staff Orione women and we are looking for  These women who speak up after they have survived sexual violence and challenge it regardless of the risk, are not just victims. They're not even primarily victims. Many I have met have become exceptional human rights defenders and leaders in their own countries, calling for their right to live free from the fear from all kinds of violence, for the right to access services and for sustainable stabilisation. Calling for women to be considered and included in peace process has, so they can hold their own leaders  These women are agents  whose determination and strength of purpose is a resource for peace and security, that we can ill-afford to ignore.

But it is also a fact that there are certain countries in which the rule of law is entirely collapse, and where there is much more scope for capacity building and support. I think the G8 countries and the international community can offer support in a way which will make an extraordinary difference to those women's lives.

I hope we can hear an update from the Foreign Secretary's latest progress and the G8 and member-states, and his plan for taking it forward following the April foreign minister's meeting  The practical measures this offers has so far been the missing link in our international response to the risks women face in  A frequent problem is the failure to understand the risks they face in the first place.

It serves a dual purpose of ensuring women get the employment needed to prevent poverty and one ability, but ensuring they get access to those services. Both those outcomes offers the stability and security benefits in peace building efforts. I have looked at the support this country provides for policing internationally. The extent to which are department's work together in this area is much  I wonder if my honourable friend thinks there is further works to do in terms of the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office in terms of the policing support in making sure these work in the best possible way and are sufficiently funded, given the constraints on us to Mr?

And has she noticed in respect of Afghanistan, where training the police is important part how that greater co-ordination has had a bigger impact on the ground? My honourable friend, I am sure knows much more about this than I do, and he is speaking with experience. But what I would say in relation to the police in Afghanistan is one of the key target we should be pursuing is recruiting more women into the Afghan police and ensuring they can play a role in pursuing a more secure situations for the women who face extreme violence on a day-to- day based -- basis. Whatever role  these women are the women we need to be involved in making the police.

It is impossible not to conclude, that despite vocal support there has been negligible improvement in women's participation in peace building since 1325 was signed in  I hope the G8 agreements will recognise the protection of women from sexual violence and their participation in peace processes are two sides of the same coin.

The question is as on the order paper.

I am always struck by how we seem to accept that sexual violence is something which just happens, that it is a fact of life, both at home in the UK and also when it occurs in  I don't accept that. There is much more that can be done  In preparing for this  I am fortunate we stumbled across some truly horrifying discussion boards with comments which illustrated really appalling attitudes towards rape.

Investigation teams announced earlier this week were very welcome. I welcome the commitment from the Foreign Secretary on this issue.

How -- victims of these crimes are often marginalised  In too many cases, the rights of women have been sacrificed in attempt to secure former peace deals. In on 18th May of 300 existing peace agreements is there any mention of gender based sexual violence. Action Aid suggests this is due partly to the fact that women are not at the table in the discussions. I think it is a priority that we should be looking to guarantee places for women around these tables. Organisations like Amnesty and Oxfam are working around the globe to try to tackle these issues. I think we should be looking at how we harness their networks on the ground to make progress. Earlier today my right honourable friend made an important speech outlining his ideas for early intervention, outlining the need to work alongside need will colleagues in fragile States and to intervene where we can. The experience over the years show was the mistakes that have been made in foreign interventions which have cost women  For example, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. I feel it was an enormous step backwards that for the first half of this Parliament there was not one woman in either the foreign office or defence ministerial team. If we are arguing that women should be round the table in peace negotiations around  then they should be around the table in these  -- in these ministries were so many decisions are taken that affect women's lives. I suspect this has never been mentioned in a defence review. There are parts of the document were it would have absolutely been appropriate to raise this issue. Sexual violence is a weapon of war, it is about power, the abuse of power and how it is used to humiliate and degrade. It causes untold misery. It is an obvious example of where preventative work can be done. I want to mention Afghanistan before I finish, were Al-Jazeera have reported a 22% rise in reported crimes against women.

I congratulate my honourable friend on securing and launching this debate and welcome the words of the honourable member for West Dunbartonshire as well. I welcome the opportunity this gives to update the House one hour initiative on preventing sexual violence in conflict as well as to be able to take into account in developing that initiative the issues that have been raised and will be raised by honourable  We have set ourselves a very important and practical goal. That is to use the United Kingdom's diplomatic influence and resources to increase the number of perpetrators of sexual violence brought to justice and help build- up the legal and practical capability of other countries to tackle these crimes. We are determined to confront the culture  to overturn the age- old assumption that rate is somehow an inevitable by-product of  and to rally the world to do more to help survivors. I have made it my personal priority at during cover presidency of the G8 this year to ask all nations to make practical commitment to help us towards this goal. We have had representatives from the G8 here in London this week. I have met them in advance of the meeting in April. The agreements we reached at the G8 we will then take to the United  We are pursuing this for many reasons. In our lifetimes, millions of women, men and children have endured the horror of rape and sexual violence in conflict, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, south Sudan,  Afghanistan, Bosnia, Syria. The sad truth is that the perpetrators of these appalling crimes still far more often than not go unpunished. In many  survivors endure the fear and torment of the abusers living freely in their communities. This shocking culture of impunity is a moral issue. Survivors face emotional and psychological pain,  social ostracism. They have a right to support and to a dignified life. Tackling rate as a weapon of war is also central. -- it is also central to add just foreign policy.

Mr Douglas Alexander.Thank you, and I congratulate the Honourable Member of Parliament for securing this important and timely debate in the House today. It is timely, not least given developments at the United Nations and within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and represents a significant issue that deserves proper time, attention, debate and action. I welcome the personal interest shown by the Foreign Secretary in advancing work on this issue and recognised his personal efforts to raise the issue on the international agenda. Where there is agreement on all sides of  I think it is only right it be acknowledged, and on  the Foreign Secretary has our full support in his efforts to prioritise sexual violence and  both for the United Kingdom and wider international  His efforts have been rightly acknowledged and raised. This work builds on decades of  done by charities, non governmental organisations and human-rights activists. I'm sure the Foreign Secretary will agree with me that their unrelenting commitment is what has insured the issue today is becoming more of a focus for governments right around  These efforts today build on that work of many and it is only right we pay tribute to their contribution. In particular, we should single out the right -- sing aloud what Women's human rights activists do. They are often subjected grave threats and risks, intimidation, abduction, even killings by those opposing their  and why they do it is because they are there to do the right  Much more must be done to support these groups and promote their agenda, so there's is not a struggle they are facing alone. And I welcome the work already being done by the UN Secretary General's representative on sexual violence in conflict? Harris is a crucial and difficult task and that is why we fully support the pledge by Her Majesty's Government to offer financial support directly to fund  Given the degree of cross-party support -- fund higher  Given the degree of cross- party support, I want to echo comments given in this chamber, before turning to the measures the Foreign Secretary has set out. It is only right that, when debating policy responses, the first take time to acknowledge the sheer scale of the challenge and indeed the extent of the suffering that we are seeking to address. Over 75% of rapes and not reported to the police here in England, so we  of no surprise that we know little of the true extent of sexual violence committed in conflict. Despite this, what must not be in any doubt is that rape and sexual violence is used as a weapon of war, torture and mass persecution. Sexual violence has been rightly described by the UN Secretary  the most persuasive -- most pervasive violation of human rights across the globe. It is time to step up efforts to respond to this harrowing trip. The conflicts that have defined the last decades of war have themselves in part been divided -- been defined by use of sexual violence. During the 1994 Rwandan genocide, more than 250,000 women were raped. Many were raped during the Croatian war. Sexual violence was widespread in other  Some of them involving  What is -- these statistics cannot do justice to the scale of human suffering involved. It is personal accounts that come closer to even beginning to shed light on the scale of horror that the use of sexual violence in conflicts inflicts on victims and horror continues to the inner conflicts raging across the world. It is right the United Kingdom has made this a priority for presidency of the G8 and we welcome the steps the Government has taken to help direct efforts at both the UK and international level to addressing  The Foreign Secretary will have our continued support in his efforts to ensure that tackling the issue of sexual violence and conflict receives the attention and the resources that it rightly  But I am sure the Foreign Secretary would agree with me that the real challenge we face collectively is how to influence the facts on the ground in these conflict areas. The true measure of success and effectiveness of any steps agreed by the G8 will be their capacity to affect change and some of the most difficult and dangerous regions of the world. Let me turn to specific packages of measures the Foreign Secretary has  We welcome the preventing sexual violence initiative -- we welcome the camp -- we welcome the Preventing Sexual Violence  Sexual violence as a tool of war remains one of the least persecuted crimes. We need to do more to improve accountability more generally on the issue. That is why the market specialist teams, that will be deployed to conflict  is indeed welcomed. There were to gather evidence, help build local capacity and help build civil society to prosecute crimes, it will be vital. But demand will was a chip capacity of even these groups when documenting and prosecuting crimes and such a horrendous scale. -- demand will always exceed capacity. That is why we should focus on building capacity within the country's without leaving countries totally Duvall -- totally dependent on outside support. Also key UN efforts to improve international co-ordination to prevent sexual violence in conflicts on the ground. This level of co-ordination is best achieved through the United Nations, so it is vital and necessary resources are made available to relevant departments, so that well- meaning objectives can be turned into concrete outcomes. That is why we hope the Government will consider recent reports that the gender based violence of responsibility within the United Nations remains chronically  Effective prevention must also extend to regulations around a supply of arms and the trade in arms which are too often ultimately used in so many of the conflicts where sexual violence becomes prevalent. The response would chance their of military equipment across ponders effectively fuels gender based violence as well as being transferred outside of war zones and remaining in operation long after conflicts have ended. In that  we will encourage the Government to clarify their position in relation to the upcoming negotiations on the arms trade treaty at the United Nations. 6 of the draft text, which explicitly refers to agenda based violence, only requires states to consider taking measures to prevent arms sales from facilitating such abuses. Many did to argue this clause must be sent and if the duty is to hope to provide effective prevention and must stipulate all practical measures to ensure weapons are not used to bear a shade or facility at of June the violence within the the Prevention, Afghanistan still reels from the effects of recent  I would welcome that the government making this a clear priority for UK efforts on this priority for UK efforts on this  Any UK... And insuring everything possible is being done today to prevent its re-emergence in the future. Nobody can deny that  this issue we are debating today is a moral issue. The suffering and scale of the terror should be justification enough for the international community to act. The Foreign Secretary is right to say that this is also a foreign policy issue and therefore a strategic imperative for the United Kingdom. The use of sexual violence and conflict are not only makes the sexual conflicts themselves harder to resolve, but makes life even harder for local communities to overcome the type of insecurity that it is in our national interest to prevent. The best remedy to prevent the use of sexual violence in conflict is to put an end to those conflicts. That may seem straightforward common  but in reality, it should inform all of our efforts on the specific issue because it means that any approach to tackling the specific issue will always be embedded within a broader strategy of preventing conflict and protecting against insecurity. Where the government is taking steps to advance this type of  it will have our full  In order to accommodate the colleagues had been to  I have imposed a four minute limit. My main messages to express my pride that Britain is leading the world into -- in tackling this important issue. Given that so many conflicts around the world are ethnic in nature, it is not surprising that sexual violence as a weapon is becoming increasingly  I would encourage my honourable friend to make every effort to to take the rest of the world with him on his quest. We talked about some of the countries around the world where we are witnessing rate, and I would just like to remind the House that this is not limited to faraway land. --  It happened here in Europe. It is also shaming that people in Bosnia have been brought to justice for the many rates that took place  -- rapes. It was the intent to dehumanise that was really a weapon of war in that conflict. I heard a story from Kosovo. I had the privilege of visiting Kosovo some 18 months ago and I met a very inspirational lady. I just want to share some of the things she said. We can talk about sexual violence and talk about it in theoretical  but this is a story which really brings it to life. A woman named Flora is a well known Albanian the dumbest and poet and a member of parliament. By profession, she was a paediatrician. As the political situation in Kosovo deteriorated in the 1990s, Flora was one of the community leaders. She was rallying support from other  getting involved in giving health care to victims of the war and giving shelter to people who are becoming orphaned. As a consequence of that, she became quite high-profile as a target for the Serb paramilitaries. Sure  she has adopted in 1999. She was tortured and interrogated before being tried and convicted of terrorist activities, but  due to international  she was eventually  By now, her family had claimed asylum in the US. It was anticipated that she would follow  but I wasn't for her. She wanted to go back to Kosovo and help the women and children who had been victims of the war. She is doing a great deal of work to support the victims of sexual abuse from that conflict. She has told me in great detail about the impact it had on some of those women. The circumstances of the sexual abuse that took place are really  They have been well- documented and I went going to the  but it really does bring to life the horror we have. -- I won't go into it now. Flora also told me about how the family is treated the  Although this is the European Society not far from us, it is something which is very it  not as advanced as here. It is also obviously, because of the ethnic nature of the conflict, the Serbs knew how the Muslim faith would treat the victims and it was a very deliberate weapon. For the  afterwards, it is really very difficult for us sitting here enjoying the right we have in the UK to really get to grips with what the impact is from them. They are quite often ostracised. National people would look to their families  but often the families have witnessed the sexual abuse, so they have a double crime of being a  It is difficult for them to come to grips with what has happened to them. Really, to understand just how lonely the plight of these victims can be. She was very anxious that I highlighted the fate of these women and I'm very pleased to be able to do that  I'm also very humbled about it because all I'm doing is talking and the reality, the day- to-day suffering of these were men and some of the children born as a consequence is very real -- of  That is why I'm very proud of the initiative that my Right Honourable Friend is taking. We really must go out of the pub -- perpetrators. We must make sure we can do a bit for humanitarian work to give support to those victims so they are not left alone as they are  I cannot do adequate justice to the victims of sexual violence in Kosovo, but go ahead today I have done my bit to bring to life what it means in practice, and to perhaps really give added resolve to the government to ensure this issue it is central to our humanitarian and diplomatic  On the assumption of reasonable self discipline and the taking of interventions, I can up the limit to six-minute per member. I will show myself to be the mistress of self- discipline this evening! It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member, and I'm glad that she referred to the war in  The Amnesty International report which came out in October last year when everyone that really set out the scale of the challenge  in ensuring first of all that women feel they can come forward and tell their stories, and that justice will be done it if we find the bravery to do that. I would also like to congratulate the Honourable Member for Oxford for securing the debate today, but I'm sure she won't mind me mentioning that although the order paper doesn't reflect get, there was cross-party support for this debate. She shouldn't apologise for not mentioning violence against men because I remember following her when she gave her maiden speech in the chamber and she spoke with such passion about a project in her own constituency for men who were suffering domestic violence. I do want to mention just briefly that, particularly for men, although the problems isn't that great, the stigma for them if they suffer sexual violence, it is considerable. They can even find themselves being criminalised, imprisoned, because they are deemed by that nation to have taken part in an immoral crime. I'm also pleased to be speaking because as a member of the National Development Select Committee, we are currently undertaking a inquiry into violence against women and  I know the secretary of  the Foreign Secretary, said it was important that we realise we're talking specifically about sexual violence and the context of conflict -- in the context. The fact is that the debate we had earlier today, I don't feel we have had two separate debates. Every issue that was spoken about in that earlier debate actually affect our capacity to impact on sexual violence in conflict zones, because the reality is, if in that state women are not going to find that the justice system supports them, if they're going to return to communities where there are  they're not going to come forward and they're not going to see justice. I wrote to a minister in the foreign and Commonwealth Office about a woman who was raid in Egypt. -- raped. And the doctor couldn't find the correct implements for the swaps can and used a pair of scissors. The woman said that experience was worse than the sexual abuse. We need to be honest today and admit that that is the situation in many of these countries. While we may wish to support women, there's a lot of work to be done, not just by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but by the Ministry of Defence, to ensure that women, girls, boys and men who are victims of sexual violence will get that justice of that they seek when they come  I welcome the Foreign Secretary's statement and it is clear that this is an issue which he has real passion for. But I do have some questions. I hope we can get a bit more detail about how he intends to achieve this. I do welcome that he told the House that he will be working closely with  This is not to score party political points. What would the Foreign Secretary believe would be an indication of success? Does he have any numbers in mind? Does he have any particular areas that he wants to concentrate on? And Howell is the working with the Department for International Development? It is particularly important that the resources are given directly to projects in countries which support women and girls who were the victims of sexual violence. If we could get more detail on how the two departments are working together that would be really helpful. It is also important that we try to get inside the minds of the men who carry out these dread fought violent crimes and to understand that when he soldier comes from a country where there is no respect  where they have no  where they are excluded in  it is so much easier to take that final step to commit an act of sexual violence. That is why I think it is vital that the work  that we tried to effect change in those countries. If we don't change the situation of sexual violence against women and  in peace, in conflict, at home and in developing countries, then we are not going to achieve the very laudable aims that the Foreign Secretary has set out for  I will give way. I thank her for giving way. Without wishing to compromise the focus of the Foreign Secretary's initiative, which I am wholeheartedly supportive of, I do agree with her that it is women's unequal status, in misogyny which exists in so many of these societies, that is both a cause and consequence of the sexual violence but we are discussing this  I would go even further. We are far more likely to see  Countries that have this kind of attitude to women are far more likely to be involved in conflict in the first place. Today, let us call for swift and just international response to sexual violence against women, girls, boys  We have to acknowledge that the most effective way we can improve the lives of women and girls so that they can live free from fear of violence and its devastating effect is to work to bring about change across a whole range of issues. Education,  employment, access to  health care and justice. Those other ways that we will protect women and that is what will make it possible for them to come forward to tell their stories, so that we can deliver justice and so that their daughters will have a There are two major areas in which women are repeatedly discriminated  First is the refusal of  This is against the rights to health care. Second, the failure to treat rape and the transmission of HIV as a prohibited weapon of war. The denial of all abortions to women and girls raped during conflict was subject of debate in the House of Lords recently and also Parliamentary  It is consider that girls and women rate in armed conflict are wounded and sick. Then they should be entitled to  And international humanitarian law is the legal framework that must be obeyed in the provision of humanitarian aid, but these acknowledgements are not sufficient without concrete actions to ensure this right is actually granted to wounded women who needed. What would be concrete action is the right to abortion for girls and women raped in an conflict is protected under humanitarian law and not subject to national laws on  This should be explicitly included in all relevant Government  including DFID's safe and unsafe abortion paper. Second, the deliberate transmission of HIV is acknowledged as a weapon of war, but not treated as a prohibited weapon of warfare.

These violate core international humanitarian law principles of  As such, those should be treated as prohibited weapons of  This failure to treat war rate, like other illegal weapons, stops victims from being entitled to  -- war rape.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank my colleague for this debate and also the One Billion Rising campaign which has really set the scene for today's action. The campaign was continues to drive the global movement to end violence against women and girls has a strong  In 2009, I joined a campaign to in sexual violence in the Congo and arched the G20 to take steps to stop the war and  I would like to extend my appreciation to all men and women who tackle violence against women and girls in that local communities and across the world, often at risk to themselves. I would like to make a special mention to the Hounslow one stop shop, which last November launched a three advice service for victims of domestic violence. --  The project is jointly run by the Met Police, Hounslow Community Safety Unit and a Hounslow domestic violence out week  We know that in communities we also have those who have suffered. -- out reach service. One constituent said to me, the war  but the suffering of her and her family continued. We know that in war zones victims of sexual violence do not have their own local support networks or local crime prevention teams. There is no protection for so many, which is  as an international community, we must stand together. Sexual violence in conflict is a moral issue and has been discussed as central to foreign policy. I am glad that this is an issue that has agreement on both sides of this  Rape and more is the darkest of military targets, used to degrade and humiliate the victims themselves and undermine their  their ethnic group, religious group, or political  to which they may belong. Last year's United Nations report provided horrific examples of how sexual violence has threatened security and impeded peace building in post conflict situations, such as Sierra Leone. We have also seen, in addition to the thousands of women that we know have been raped, 000 women estimated in the war  an estimated 250,000 in Rwanda in 1994, 64,000 in Sierra  We are seeing examples in Syria of women raped in prison and in their homes. But we have also seen the rape of men in any conflict zones, which will also be part of the agenda of tackling sexual violence. The Major-General at the helm of the UN peacekeeping mission in Democratic Republic of Congo stated that it has become more dangerous to become a woman fetching water or firewood than it is to be a fighter on the front  I am sure, as we move forward with the GAA at this year, we will continue the momentum to secure new international action against the use of rape and sexual violence. -- with the G8 this year. We will focus on both investigations and  as well as prevention. We know the conviction rates of sexual violence and conflict is -- bills -- those that an international disgrace. We must also have a strategy for support for women's rights. I welcomed yesterday to Parliament some of the key members of the global women's rights movements, brought together in London by a charity to share their experiences and expertise of women's leadership, tackling gender violence in their own countries and political participation. Sexual violence is also not just a problem in conflict areas, the brutal rape and murder in India at Christmas or the 23-year-old on a bus has also shown that we must tackle violence against women in all its forms in all the countries of the world, so we do not see attitudes of acceptability that are shaped by a current or future generations. Judy is an important debate in the long -- today is an important debate to end the continuing violence against women and ensure this is a priority for us and fellow partners abroad. In conclusion, this is a challenge of enormous scale, a campaign that must across nations and cultures. I am pleased this is on the agenda for the Foreign Secretary and hope he can address a few questions in  Firstly, the level of support he has achieved from the international community for this, not just being on the agenda, but hang on the agenda. Secondly, how he hopes the strategies beginning now will be sustained by the G8 and other international bodies and be actively reflected, not just in foreign policy, but defence policy and International Development  so we see an end to sexual violence in conflicts in our Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have seen rape used as a weapon  When I was in Bosnia in  and 25,000-50,000 women were raped during the Bosnian war. Across the region.

I took the family to the local  I went past the same place the next day to discover they had been returned, wrong religion in the mortuary. How ghastly is  sexual violence, in war? How terrible. My soldiers buried 104 people in a mass grave at I visited again last year. We think  Most of them were women. A lot of them were children. It was  And that was most definitely something that we should all campaign to stop. I applaud what the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development, and  are doing to try and stop this revolting practice of sexual violence in war.Will you give way?  If you are quick. I will be. It is not just rape itself but I would draw attention to, it is the conviction and prosecution rate. In the field where he fought, only one 000 perpetrators of those crimes were actually prosecuted. Therefore we join me in welcoming international protocol proposed by the Foreign Secretary which will ensure prosecution as well as investigation into these issues? That was quick, and Q. -- thank you. Of course I agree with you. I have given evidence in five trials. And I am thrilled that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Republic of Yugoslavia has brought charges against people for rape as a crime against humanity and had convictions. And  I am fully aware that probably not even one in 100 people who are guilty of such crimes in Bosnia have been brought to justice. I am delighted that, in Europe, for the first time ever, the International Criminal Tribunal is actually bringing convictions on  That came because the International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda a started it. That is a great move and we should send a firm message to the whole world that this must be considered one of the gravest crimes ever. May I end  because I am going to finish before my time, Mr Speaker, by commending our British soldiers? Shall I tell you what has so just said to me when a previous Foreign Secretary and a Conservative one at that gave the orders to start planning the withdrawal from Bosnia I wanted out to, and he said well  so a. He said, have not me,  I said why not? He said, our duty is here protecting these women and children and the vulnerable. That is what we are here to do. I  we never did withdraw, but that shows the quality of soldiers that we have. We have but far too many stories of how badly armed forces behave and here is one that shows the quality of people we send out to put our values into the world outside our country. Thank  Mr Speaker. It is indeed a privilege to speak after someone who knows exactly what the situation is like and can tell us so graphically the sort of experiences to have seen with his  And the importance,  of what we are here for. Securing the debate was very important and I think it is the put -- appropriate to pay tribute to the Foreign Secretary and the shadow Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development, but the two particularly that I mentioned  because they have given up their time to be here for the whole of this very important debate. I think that is significant that I hope it is a message that goes out that it is seen as very important. Then maybe some people who watch a debate like this, and they may  well, there weren't very many people here and it looks a bit  they can't really think a bit as important, but the fact that it has been possible for that time to be given up by senior figures shows that it is very important. Several speakers have said that this subject challenge is a lot of us who would probably prefer there to be no conflict or who would like to  the answer to all this is that they should be no war, or that we shouldn't get involved. There is this issue about, when and how do you intervene and in what ways. The examples we have had from what happened in the former Yugoslavia were a vindication of intervention -- were an indication. They didn't happen because we intervened,  because of such intervention, some of those women who might otherwise have been affected were actually saved from having this happened to them. But it is still a challenge because we have got to ask ourselves whether it is right to intervene or whether we have helped to provoke some of the conflicts which are there. Of  some of these complex, out of the growth and a quality that there is in the world and the world's resources. There are many things we can be doing which go beyond a narrower subject to ensure these situations should not come. The message has to come... Indeed. Given it is recognised that sexual violence is one of the key factors which destabilise this conflict in the first place, does she not agree that tackling sexual violence and preventing it in the first base is one way to prevent conflict and achieve exactly the aim that she is calling for? I absolutely agree  Sometimes, when you because this up -- at a subject as  it can feel, well, it has always been there, it has been there through history, we know that. We can read history of any conflict going back hundreds of years and you will see examples of this sort of behaviour happening. But 40  when a lot of the big campaigning started in this country on violence against women, starting with the setting up of domestic violence refugees and so on, --  a lot of people said, you will never change it. And although we have heard how far there is to go even in our own country on some of these issues, I would say progress has been made. Sometimes it feels it is three steps forward and two back when you're dealing with that difficulties of a justice system and all the problems there, but we have made progress and changed attitudes. Those of us who started a lot of those campaigns in the early days have seen a real  That is not to become complacent but it is to say if you make that effort, you can begin to change the way people think, behave, the way they are treated. While this is not such a big subject, it  well, what can we do? But we have to make that effort, because if we can start to make those changes... And those who are in peacekeeping forces have a particular responsibility to bear in the way they behave and the attitudes they have. One of the things we have had to do and I'm sure we do do it in our own armed forces is to ensure that the way women are treated, whether they are part of those armed services, how they treat women when they are art  it is crucial to lead by example -- when they are caught on the field. One of the ways we can make changes is to involve far more women in the processes of changing these things, of changing their own countries, of changing even the peace process. Because as many people have said, far too few women feature in the big meetings that take place, the peace conferences and so on. Often, you have to ask, where are all the women? It is important we ensure that they are there, that their voice is heard, that they encouraged and given the tools to start to change it things, not just for their own generation, but for future generations. I will be very  We need women to be represented at peace conferences, but the only way they can be represented is if they actually are leaders in their own community and that is how we get them represented. We have got that to do, which I think the Foreign Secretary is  A I do suspect we have  because many people have been in this conflict zones and a pad fantastic stories of some of the women who can speak up -- and have fantastic stories. Building that up from the bottom-up is clearly  but some of them are already there and we need to see and hear from them. Yes, it is a big subject, but let's not just come back in the year's time or two years and have the same discussion  Let's come back and feel there has been some very real  I would like to thank you for indulging me. Unfortunately, I was trying to be in demand debates at once and I spoke in the eating disorders debate and the wind-up took longer than I thought. I would like to congratulate my honourable  of the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon in securing this important debate. She knows my enormous interest in this issue. It is not just on the international stage but I have also spoken about domestic violence in this country and I have said before, if men know that the odds of them getting caught with only six % prosecution rate but they have a 94 % of getting away with it, they're probably going to go for it. The international statistics are even more dramatic. In the former  they have a one in 000 chance of actually getting  In Rwanda, it is a one 000 chance of getting  This is a disgrace and the Foreign Secretary is absolutely right to try and take a lead on this important initiative. One of the by-product of rate, an rate as a weapon of war which I saw in  was the orphans themselves  They were infected by it -- by AIDS. They live with a timebomb within them. They could die at any time. It is very important that we look not just at the act itself, it is important we investigate and prosecute those who perpetrate it and we must look at what happens afterwards. Will it must look at the children themselves -- we must look. We must see what we can do to give them more support. I would like to perhaps a brat pop by also paying tribute to the International Commission on missing persons --  If we can take a lead in supporting the excellent work they have done in Bosnia for the past 15  they had done great  it is important that the UK perhaps take a lead in securing a future for the icy MP and I would like to end by a welcoming the Foreign Secretary's international protocol to investigate and  -- ICMP. I would like to thank everybody has contributed to this debate. It is timely and  but also the subject could not be more sensitive. Everybody who has contributed has lived up to the challenge. I did like to thank the honourable member for West Dunbar and chauffeur sharing my passion -- for sharing  And the Honourable Member for East Lothian for her cross-party support in co- sponsoring this debate.
