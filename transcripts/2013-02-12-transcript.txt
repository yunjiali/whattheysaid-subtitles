Given Labour's record, it is extraordinary they now want election others about the reform of the other place which they did not deliver when they had the opportunity to do so. I wonder if a party in government what to say -- were to get annihilated at the general election, should they keep Peers and House of Lords? Purely think that will -- the only thing that will be annihilated is the argument for the independence of Scotland which is getting no currency because the majority of people want to keep the UK together. We are devolving power to the most appropriate level through local enterprise partnerships and finance  giving local authority is a power of confidence and City We delivered a referendum in Wales which resulted in giving them Primary powers in 20 areas and we continue to review the present arrangements in Wales.

But it is my intention to bring forward these proposals and I look forward to working with him and all of us who are interested and as I said, it should be transparent and robust and fair and I look forward to ensuring it meet that quality. A government is committed to doing all it can to maximise registration and we have published detailed research which has informed plans to use data matching, and new technology to modernise the system of voting and register and to vote as we going to individual electoral registration to make it as convenient as possible to register to vote.

I do not accept that there is no link between constitutional reform and rebuilding the shattered British economy left in such a parlous state by his party. Vicky to that is -- the Nikkei two that is in some of the questions earlier.

I am proud of the Human Rights Act. It has been used to protect the rights of the vulnerable in residential care  the rights of an Asperger's sufferer who has been extradited to  and much more.

That is a disagreement which is rather openly and in a grown-up way reflected in the conclusions of the commission. Will my right Hon and Hon Friend make it a priority to introduce transparency into collective ministerial responsibility? -- right honourable friend. Collective responsibility prevails where there is collective agreement and collective decision upon which collective responsibility is based. It isn't very easy, or certainly not possible to enforce, collective responsibility in the absence of a collective decision taken first. Order! Topical questions. As Deputy Prime Minister I support the Prime Minister on a full range of government at initiatives. I take special responsibility for this government's programme of political constitutional reform. I read his speech last week about rewarding work. Three days before  the Independent reported that the government's figures reveal that child poverty would increase 000 as a result of 1% caps on benefit rises. It was confirmed in a parliamentary answer that around 50% of those 200,000 would be families with at least one person in employment. What is the government going to do to make sure that work is a pathway out of poverty? The main thing to do is make sure that work always pays. That is why we are introducing much-needed reforms to the benefits  which were doctored by the previous administration. We have the introduction of the Universal  Even if you work for a few hours a week, it pays to do so. We get rid of this incentives, such as the 16 our room.

It is bad enough in my borough, but it is even worse in his city of Sheffield, where 5027 people will be hit. This is not our policy to tackle under occupation because they cannot move. They have got no choice. That is why it is called the bedroom tax. You only get housing benefit if you are on low income.

The last census confirmed there is a shortfall between Nottingham's at a population and the number of people on the electoral register. I hoped the Deputy Prime Minister agrees this is not only a democratic  but a serious threat to cancel finances. Will he take steps to address the problem of under We have taken a number of initiatives which we hope will sustain the electoral register to the highest extent possible.

She may ask the question about her party who said they would end boom and bust! And he went on a charm offensive with bankers -- he went. Maybe she should account for that! Can ask about the benefits of the government's social care policy? The benefits of the social care reforms we announced yesterday are universal for the first time -- and for the first time everybody will have peace of mind they will not need to sell the property to deal with the catastrophic costs faced in social care. We are increasing them are in line with the recommendations, the mean test  so many more people will be given assistance.

In regard to social mobility, can I ask which barrier he believes to be the most difficult for my constituents to overcome? Is it keeping hold of the homes because of the bedroomed tax, is it scrapping BMA and travelling A little spontaneity would not go amiss from time to time. The banks went up because of the irresponsibility of his party and the parties on this side of the House and of the disgrace on the Labour which meant a cleaner paid more on their wages and that boss on their shares and it is the parties on this side which means -- which have meant people were paying less than half on income tax than they did under Labour! A does he regrets his words in November that there is no prospect of securing a real-terms cut in the EU budget, and does he believe the Prime Minister is on a roll and may also be successful in achieving the renegotiation of powers in the EU that will give Britain a better deal? A lesson and of the highly successful summit last week is it is important to set out a tougher negotiating position -- a lesson of. I sent a tougher approach out to politicians around the EU and I created alliances with other  like the Dutch and crucially the Germans.

If we are to see real decentralisation to local government, would the Minister agree structures need to change and part of the structural change should be fewer councillors and councils? Up the key thing is that councillors and electoral Brett -- and electoral representatives should work hard for their constituents and I am not persuaded there is a magic numerical number in terms of the number of councillors. It is essential to provide more and more local accountability for more powers flowing from Whitehall to local authorities and communities.

Would he take -- will he take action against those MPs who used the conflict in Israel to make inflammatory statements about Jews and does he not realise that his party is getting a reputation among some senior members for being hostile to Jewish people? I am unambiguous in my condemnation of anyone from whatever party who uses insensitive and provocative and offensive language to describe a long-running conflict about which people have very strong feelings on one side or the other, but where I think everybody is duty-bound to choose their words carefully and to tread carefully when entering into this very heated debate. Could he answer the question? 000 people will be affected financially by the changes, a two- thirds of those are disabled, what does he think of that?  how people respond depends on the specific family circumstances and partly on the working circumstances and whether they can or cannot increase the amount of hours they work to make  it depends whether they take in people to live in the spare bedroom and make up the difference  and the use by local authorities of the discretion refund we have made available.

It is number  The answer is none, as it is not about making savings. If the Crown Prosecution Service is to make decisions not to proceed with that prosecution on grounds of cost or because of concerns of their health of a victim, is it not right that a proper record is kept of how many and why? So that victims, the public and Parliament can hold both the Crown Prosecution Service and ministers properly to account. I do think it's important to -- that proportionality has been re- introduced to the code for Crown prosecutors. We have all seen matters which should not be prosecuted and where it is important to take the balance. As regards recording, the Crown Prosecution Service keeps a considerable amount of Records. And  it costs money. I will think over the point. I welcome the reintroduction of the proportionality test as part of the wider public interest test. Will my right honourable friend reassure the constituents I represent that the question of cost is but one of it questions which are to be asked about Crown prosecutors when applying a public interest test, and it is not to be determined on the basis of cost alone? My honourable friend makes the point honourable friend makes the point better even than I could. I would just make too short points, if I  The first, it is not just  It is about assessing cost and what the likely circumstances and other points which he made would be. The other point is that in effect -- effective case management, it is important to concentrate on the main and most serious suspects and so give an opportunity for the prosecution to consider that. I meet regularly with the Director of Public Prosecutions and discuss  Most recently, on 23rd  2013. We are committed to prosecuting perpetrators of rape and serious sexual assault, and the CPS will work closely with the police to build strong prosecution cases and build the matter in accordance with the Code for Crown  A woman to occur on life during the course of a trial which she described as like being raped all over again. -- a woman took her own life. What steps will he take to ensure that CPS policy on vulnerable victims and witnesses seeking counselling is enforced, given that this woman was discouraged by the police from seeking support? There is no doubt that this story is a tragic one and I am sure the House will join with me in expressing our sympathy to her relatives and family. I take very seriously any suggestion that she might not have received the support she was entitled. As you will be aware, the Home Secretary announced yesterday that she knew the police were carrying out a review of their role in this matter and I have no doubt that the Crown Prosecution Service will contribute to that process. I can say that on the information I have been given  it appears to me that the Crown Prosecution Service took all steps that I would have expected to try to support her as a form of all victim and witness. I would like to emphasise that is not to sit there may not be lessons that can be learned. -- I would like to emphasise that that is not Will he said that the therapy are oak treatment for the mental health of a witness will not be prevented? Guidelines are crystal-clear almost. A victim or witness giving evidence should not be prevented from accessing their care they might require. I believe it is the case that the woman we were talking about was referred to the possibility of counselling when it was seen she was distressed prior to the case taking place. So far as the issues in court are  there are protocols in place to try to familiarise people with the court process, and to make sure that the trauma of giving evidence in court is lessened.

Is it not time that we looked at this to make sure there is a decent rate prosecution policy in this country, not just one that looks good on paper? I share her concerns but I am not sure I share the sweeping generalisations. The evidence is that the conviction rate for rape is consistently improving. I think that is something that has would like to bear in mind. As for the very serious suggestions that this woman was misled, yes, that is a matter of concern. As I indicated  the information I had been given supports the view, to me, but both the CPS and the Greater Manchester Police correctly advised her and recommended routes by which she could obtain councillor. The issue raised at some other organisational police force might have said something to the contrary is of serious concern and will be looked into. The Serious Fraud Office is not routinely informed about the work of overseas prosecuting agencies. Where it is properly above the with a not be appropriate to comment in relation to Cohen prosecutions. The Attorney-General knows that at least one Contractor of the Serious Fraud Office is being investigated for fraud over seas. Apart from being embarrassing, does this not constitute a conflict of interests? Will he tell a house when he proposes to publish the funding -- the findings of the report completed in 2011? Can I start by dealing with the first part of the question? I will go on to the report afterwards. Firstly, I am not in a position to comment on what is or is not being investigated. When the Serious Fraud Office takes on an investigation, were for their Cohen, a publisher on their website. There are sometimes circumstances where they cannot do this. If there were such a conflict of interests, such conflicts can arise frequently. There are a series of protocols in place to make sure that this does not impede their efficiency or their ability to carry out such an investigation. As for the report, she knows what I say previously. If I would like to see as much as possible of its contents published. There are issues in respect of better protection.

I am very pleased that Professor Shirley  former vice Chancellor of Loughborough University, is the chairman Chief Constable and I am pleased that at all ranks, members of the police force are part of the college and include members of police staff. That is important that it includes everybody. As the home secretary who established the IPCC in the first place, may I welcome the announcements which the home secretary has made today. They seem to me to be a sensible development of those powers. Can I ask two questions? One is about the chair of the IPCC, who served for seven years as an extremely effective and independent Chief Inspector of Prisons. I certainly have confidence in her ability to take this forward. The second thing is on the relationship between the professional standards units of individual forces and the IPCC. I can see that at a time of limited  the money has got to come from somewhere. Would she have a care to ensure the professional standards units in individual forces are not so denuded that they cannot do their crucial work, both of identifying early possible by police officers and investigating complaints which may start at low  but then turn into much more serious complaints which need to be allocated to the IPCC? Indeed, I see this as a development of the  This is a necessary and important developments. The chairman of the IPCC has done an excellent job.

We will not talk about not having professional the standards -- standards departments at all. We will talk about what the level of transfer is and where the boundary will fall. Does my right honourable friend agree that one great unanswered question in this sorry saga of phone hacking is, how what was that the police had the evidence which they took from Glenn Mulcaire in  which suggested that there was widespread law-breaking taking place yet not only was nothing done but there was that denial that it existed Cross that was intended to be examined by Lord Justice Leveson in his inquiry. Can she confirmed that the investigation will still take place to answer those questions? My understanding is that that will indeed be part of the second part that will take place. As my honourable friend knows, there has always been the question of what can be done. A great deal was done by Lord Justice Leveson at  Those investigations are still continuing.

In relation to the Levison requirements, we will be discussing with the College of policing how each of these can best be implemented. Lord Justice Leveson reflected in his report that the police landscape had changed over the time that the report was written and the evidence  We need to consider how best these can be implemented. Will my right honourable friend agree that while we are all aware there have been some unacceptable relationships between certain police officers and journalists, nevertheless, the press does often provide invaluable help in solving crime? Post Leveson Inquiry, many police forces are seriously restricting contact between police officers and journalists. Is there a danger this could become too heavy handed and counter- The police domain needed help of the press with investigations at -- do need help from the press. But the police need to be more considerate regarding the implications of this in other circumstances and that is why prior to the Leveson report and also in the Leveson report, we had been looking at what was appropriate relationships between the police and the press and transparency is a great way to ensure these discussions are being held where it is appropriate to do so.

When we look at police integrity, can we look at those people he suggested the government could not make it difficult financial decisions and reforms without crime coming up? The reforms have ensured crime goes down and has gone down. The police reforms are working. We were told by members on the opposite side that the only thing that would happen when the reforms and the cuts in police budgets arrived was crime would go up and the opposite has happened, crime continues to fall.Will we all welcome a system that will ensure and uphold the integrity of police, could the Secretary of State provide reassurance to my constituents that the already overstretched local police budgets will not endure further pressures as a result of the statement she has made today? -- while we welcome. As I have said, what an -- what I have announced is that we will transfer some work from police forces to the IPCC so there will be less work in that area for professional standards departments and we will talk about how all resources should transfer to the IPCC to ensure a cover the work that will be done by that body rather than by police forces.

I have served in previous government and have taken the opportunity to talk to other ministers who have served.

It is four weeks since the Irish authorities discovered horsemeat Bin beefburgers and 10 million were  -- in beefburgers.

Will she share with me that our border...  I am happy for the record to be put straight on that and in the heat of the debate, that was a slip of the tongue. As the granddaughter of a cattle farmer in Northern Ireland, it is incumbent upon me to recommend the meat of the Good cows of Northern Ireland. I will give way. May I also correct the record that she will find no contamination was found in North Yorkshire? Could I it also congratulate her on the motion, but there is also one thing missing and I did not know if it was on purpose or by accident, there was no reference to the British meat trade, which has not been implicated in  processed or frozen  and we do not want any collateral damage to the excellent trade here that meets the highest standards of traceability, welfare and good food! I believe traces of DNA you were found and if she has  I am sure she will put the record straight at.

I remember him saying that on the radio show the other day. And the advice from the Chief Medical  But the Chief Medical Officer said yesterday testing has never been done because nobody wants to put humans to the test and find out which person is susceptible to this serious blood disorder we have talked about, and it will be completely unethical and impossible to conduct such a survey, so the government is in a difficult  They may want to minimise public concern over this, but it is a very difficult situation when there is no safe dose in humans for  As the responsibility now lies with the retailers to help restore confidence, should there be an aggressive campaign by retailers to assure customers that the beef they buy from now want is British, and what more can she do to ensure customers have confidence they are eating British beef?

I said also there is no unsafe legal level  I am no legal medical expert -- expert, but there could be serious side-effects and it should only be taken under medical supervision. The frontbench is talking already, that is not good! To go back to the positive tests on that horsemeat led them to a meat trader who admitted buying it from a UK company in Hull last July. A spokesman said that shipment was the first that came to light but other tests identified other  He has identified the names of companies involved and I received that information on Friday. These UK companies may or may not have supplied suspect products but while there is suspicion, the food industry has the right to know that information. I wrote to the Environment Secretary on Friday offering to share that information and when he replied to me yesterday, he told me to hand it over to the police and Food Standards Agency, which I had already done and I assume he has it. But on Saturday, after a conversation with a food industry representative, I realised the Secretary of State had not revealed the names of those firms to the food industry at that meeting and I asked why not? He fails to answer, why did he not tell the food industry where to look and why has he not released those names to the public so we can have full transparency of an this problem? If the government wants the industry to test on the basis  why did he not share those names at Saturday's meeting? In the advice to the public sector advice -- issued at 10pm on Sunday, he left -- he put the responsibility for public safety on other people. He reminded public bodies of their responsibility, he said they should be rigorous procurement procedures in place with reputable suppliers. If he knows there are problems with some suppliers, why has he not told head teachers, local authorities and hospitals about those companies there are being investigated? -- that of being investigated. I am happy to take the invitation. I am straining to be as brief as  The FSA has been clear in giving advice to all those who supply to public institutions such  schools and hospitals. The statement I said yesterday, it is the suppliers of food who have the ultimate responsibility for the quality of what they sell.We are no wiser about if the Secretary of State knows the names of these  That begs the question, has the FSA told him or has he asked? On Friday, the FSA said the police were involved, I thought things were under control. But on Friday night, the Metropolitan Police said they had at talks -- said they had had talks but there was no life investigation. What action has been taken against these companies? Has the FSA taking evidence and why has the FSA not been called in? If there is no problem with these companies, will he say so now on the record?

Can he tell us how many products are a large public sector ring -- public sector catering suppliers will be tested and how many products will be tested?

Is he prepared to answer those questions today? As a lamb producer, I am pleased to say in Stornoway, we have seen an upturn in trade as a result of this. It beggars belief it for the tagging that has gone on that this has happened.

Thus the Minister not accept that that is an important element to resolve this situation? I agree with the honourable gentleman, the British Industry is a ï¿½12 billion industry and thousands of jobs  Farmers are trying to export their animals and products all over the place. People are coming here to look at some of our excellent rare breeds as beef, but are particularly good for particular types a climate. This is obviously a very worrying time for Fimbra -- sued industry. I would like to move on... I give way.The honourable lady said earlier on about the upsurge over the last week of the local butchers. 13% have had an increase in their usage. Does she feel that traceability present at this moment of time in honour of the UK should be a key factor for us being able to have a Good traceability is going to be key to solving this crisis. I look forward to the Secretary of State putting in robust measures with the full food supply chain to make sure this type of scandal cannot hit our industry again. I would like to turn to the issue of regulation. The Right Honourable gentle man talked about inheriting the Food Standards Agency. He is right, he  Unfortunately, his government brokered up in 2010. I refer him... He says he did not, he was not in the department at the time. The FSA website has it chapter and verse.

That is why this official food sampling survey is a joint DEFRA and Food Standards Agency survey. Can he confirm that this is the first survey of public content that his department has carried out since his government removed composition of labelling responsibilities from the FSA in 2010? This ideological government, that wants to deregulate everything, has created a bureaucratic nightmare when a fragmented the FSA's responsibility for labelling.

Can he tell the House, is he confident that the FSA's meat Hygiene Service can be cut by eight ï¿½12 million up to 2014 without its ability to tackle breaches of the lot? I would like to move on to the question of  I asked this food  who is in his place today, about problems with a horse passport system. I was concerned that horses were being slaughtered in UK abattoirs and entering the human food chain. Of the 9th UK forces which tested positive for  one was stopped, five went to  to two men never LANs and wanted the UK. Has he considered that horses are going into the food chain? The FSA sampled about 156 horses for Bute out of 9,000 horses slaughtered in 2012. Nine of them tested positive, 6%. If that is  that suggests that when over 100 contaminated horses may have entered the food chain. I raised this tale 0.5 weeks ago and received a garbled response. -- I have received this -- I raced this 2 and a half weeks ago. Can I ask her view on policing died on -- are putting DAI in meets not meant to go into the human food chain? I do not know how condemned meat is currently dealt with.

The treatment of condemned meat is something I am not fully across at  I am sure in the next day or so I will learn a lot more. We have had the evidence about an illegal trade in horses from Ireland to the UK. That programme is going to be aired tonight.

Thank you Mr  It is good to be back at the despatch box on this subject two days running. I congratulate the honourable lady for persuading her party hierarchy for bringing this important issue to the floor of the House of Commons again. I made an oral statement to the House  and I set out the facts on what has happened, and the vations into those incidents which  I am pleased to update the House on further develop pts. Since yesterday, Tesco have confirmed that a frozen spaghetti bolognese from the same factory as the other withdrawn Comigel products has tested positive for  The product has been withdrawn and this result does not appear to suggest a new source of illegal horsemeat. I am meeting senior figures at the later today, with the Food Standards Agency chairman the noble Lord, Lord Rooker who I spoke to this morning. I can now also confirm that the meeting I proposed with key European ministers and the  is taking place in Brussels tomorrow evening, and I will speak to the Dutch minister, and Polish minister later today. In my statement yesterday I set out the action I have taken to ensure that retailers, meat manufacturer, and processers are carrying out urgent testing of processed beef products and making their test results public. It is clear from conversation with the European ministers in recent day, that the European Commission recognises the urgency of the current incidents. It is clear there are complex...

I thank the right honourable gentleman for  It is great to hear this most Euro-sceptic of secretaries of state doing his best for cooperation in this area. Can he say whether he will press his European colleagues to do random testing such as being carried out in UK supermarkets in their countries?We, the Shadow Secretary again got ahead of the gape on what I was about to say in my speech. I did say yesterday in the state that I have a gut feing, and I am very  that too much is take on trust within the current system. Too often it is taken on trust that a truck is loaded, and the contents of the pallets are marks on the certificate and from there on nothing is looked at it. I entirely agree with the Hoyle and the previous gentleman who spoke that, we do need to do more testing and I have discussed this yesterday with the noble Lord, Lord reeker and again this morning. When this is all over there will be lessons learned process and I will be very keen that we do establish more systematic testing of product, so we look at the material, whichances some of her questions about the freezer plant in Northern Ireland. Because the moment it very much paper base system, too much taken  Does he adegree with me one of the already learned lessons in all of this is there a fallacy for peep to chase the notion that you can have cheap food, and quality food? The two do not go hand in hand. We have to educate the market place, and the consumer, that if you want quality, you have got to pay for it f you want good quality tasty food it has to be paid for you cannot have this notion of cheap food. Many supermarkets have done, it will be the ewe nation of a vital industry.  I am grateful to the honourable member for that question. He raises an interesting point. We have to be careful about this. There are citizens in this country who want to buy a product for speed, and for convenience, and may not want to pay a preep yum price. They deserve exactly the same rigorous quality Stan dar, they deserve exactly the same adherance to what is on the Labour, and if they buy a cheaper product marked processed  they should get processed  They should be as grieved as anyone by the most expensive sirloin stake if it is not what it says on the label. It is an important point for consumers. If people in this country buy a cheap  they should get a good  which conforms to the  That is a really important  Which I have discussed with the retheyers.

Which is entirely legal, under the 1990 food  and the E ufpt food labelling Reg regulations.Well, I I am grateful to my honourable friend for her question, and I bow to her knowledge on these matters as a previous member of the European parment.

Well, I am congratulateful, he raises an important question which came up  I think we have to take note of the Chief Medical Officers very cleared a vice yesterday. I will repeat the quote from her. It is understandable that people will be concerned, but it is important to emphasise that even if Bute is found to be present at low lev, there is a low risk indeed that it would cause any harm to health.

Again, today sh as he did yesterday, he has spoken about criminal activity and fraudulent activity. There seems to be so many cases centred round all of what is happening here, is he giving any indication to the House today, that there is organised criminal activity in what we are witnessing?That is a perfectly valid question, and I think it is too early to tell.

The British food and farming industries are one of this country's great success stories. I will not let them be talked down. The food industry has continued to grow during the current difficult economic conditions. Its export performance in particular has been  In 2010 the UK food and drink industry contributed ï¿½90 billion Stirling gross value to the economy and in 2011 achieves exports worth ï¿½18.2 billion of which meat and meat depructs accounted for ï¿½1.7. Food and drink manufacturing is the UK's largest manufacturing sector employing 3.2 million people. Jobs in the UK depend in part on consumer confidence in processed meat were ducts that. Is why I have emphasised the importance of food business taking rapid steps to reassure consumers and everseas markets by testing all their processed beef products and making results public. Transparency is key to confidence. We will see whatever is necessary to ensure British farmers and food manufacturers have access to export markets. This includes making sure British food is recognised for its rigorous standards and traceability and our producers do not get a bad reputation due to the Europe-wide Morse height incidents. The member for central Ayrshires with spot on. The food industry needs to look to the future and embrace new technologies. I thank the Secretary of State very much for giving way. He made the point yesterday that the whole process of tracing processed meet product is through the paper chase. I'm very keen to see we have proper inspections of the meat and meat product that comes into this country so we can actually see what is in those lorries rather than just being signed off at the end and coming on threw into the United Kingdom.

I know with my exchanges with the FSA Chairman and industry leaders this situation is being taken very seriously across the food chain. We shall look at the lessons to be learned from the problems once the immediate instance is resolved. I  I believe we have a system that has too much trust in paper-based systems and we need to look at products. My top priority over the coming days and weeks will be to back the Food Standards Agency as they follow through their investigations and to collaborate with European ministers, the commission and the UK food industry to root out unacceptable practices and rebuild justified confidence in food for consumers. Consumers must have confidence in the products they buy for themselves and their families and we must all work together to ensure that this is the casement Can I just mention, we are introducing an eight-minute time limit Can I congratulate the honourable lady and the opposition benches for securing such a timely debate on this. Today we should be celebrating the food industry for the very reasons the honourable lady has said in her  about the numbers employed. But I would just like to state that I represent one of the lrgeest meat-producing constituencies in the country. -- largest. And we celebrate the fact that frisk is the largest market in the skr and  also on & smaller one. We know that farm gate prices are falling and we know currently a crisis in the sheep industry and it is widely recognised in the north of England that we are very, very worried about the state of the lamb  fearing that many of the sheep producers may go out of  But turning to the issue  may I just say that I think we ought to take perhaps a lesson from this and revise our eating habits as consumers. I remember brought up and having a small roast with the family on a  Using leftovers to go into other dishes during the week. Were we to do that? Were we to encourages manufacturers from now  at this time, to take British- sourced beef into processed and frozen foods, I believe that would be the speediest way to restore confidence in the food industry is. Retailers accept their be responsibility and they have risen to the challenge that the Secretary of State has set them. My concern is this: I'm very proud to have Ferra head quart irs in the constituency near York -- headquarters. But it would seem perverse we are accepting  testing within a wee, the results to be were dused by Friday and we may have to reexport them to Germany and elsewhere for the purposes of testing. This is really a little bit gross. I hope that would not be the case. I would like to draw on something I believe the Secretary of State and the Government can do. Before I do, I would like to reassure the honourable lady opposite that in so far as Dalefak is concerned and they'll issue a statement to this  the trace was found to be less than 1% in its consignment. Under the present rules this is not deemed to be contaminated meat. I think it would really help everybody if we stop talking about contamination when it is a trace. I think we need to move the debate on to what is a tris and I think at some stage the FSA or the department are going to have to say what trace is acceptable going  You are never going to get an entire sample for perfectly understandable reasons, fre from  I do take on bored what  and I believe from the tests that are being conducted, that they are going to look for equine presence to 1%, not to 0.1%. But that does raise the issue about the pork being found in the halal products supplied to a prison last  Is she then saying it is not possible to guarantee to consumers from certain faith groups that we can never get rid of trace of other animals? And shouldn't - what does that men for factories that are branding themselves as halal? Does that men they can no longer deal with pork products. I think it is a separate debate. I think we need to look at the costs for having two separate lines, one for beef and one for pork. I think we need to come back in the future to look at what is acceptable as a trace and distinguish it on gross contamination. The debate today is gross contamination of 60 to 100% which I think is so offensive to  Can I just say that we do need an assurance that whether it is Romania, France, Poland,  Sweden, wherever, that these exporting countries within the European Union are conducting the product checks, both physical and labelling, at the point of  Unless we can have an assurance from the commission that this is happening, then I dent believe consumers are going to take much confidence in the process.

Now the fact is, it is in the food  It's continuing to enter the food chain as far as we know at this time and we're continuing to find more contamination in the frozen foods in our freezers.

We have to stop this movement around the 16 countries involved. I would imagine my honourable  the Secretary of State, would have huge support of other Member States in the European Union, if this regard. But, until such time as we can actually inspire confidence again, in the food  allow the retailers to actually get on with what they are  which is delivering safe, healthy food to our supermarkets, but I do believe that we ought to recognise what other honourable members have said today, that this is an opportunity to recognise the excellence of British-produced beef, to try and see to what extent this can be used. I do accept the Secretary of State's point that this is a premium product and it is now going for premium prices. But I think he must also accept that because of the labelling provisions and the traceability and the additional animal welfare conditions that we have often, in this country, uniquely imposed on our producers, that, in turn, has increased the cost. Farm gate prices are going down. Feed costs have gone up. The cost of transporting the animal to slaughter has gone up. The slaughter houses are now fewer and further apart. So, I do believe that we ought to use this as an important to encourage retailers, going forward, to look to sourcing locally-produced beef for their processed and frozen products. May I just say that I celebrate the contribution of the beef and of the eat industry to the UK, not just locally sourced food, that many from my area will go abroad for breeding purposes because of the uniqueness and the life history of each particular herd. I will condition clued by saying that this debate is very timely. I --  I believe the FSA were caught on the back foot. When they were told by FSA Ireland that particular tests were going to be conducted on particular products coming into our food chain through our supermarkets in November, that was a wake-up call to the FSA UK, It could have been in the food chain for up to one year.Who knows, it may have been longer, so we need to get to the bottom of this. I accept the assurance there will be criminal proceedings to follow from  but we know the pwheefls the law move slowly and is an opportunity for the Secretary of State tomorrow, to take this argument to Europe, it is a European wide problem, we must have a European wide solution, I believe that the answer is in our own food labelling provisions and in  I hope this will give him every strength and arm to his elbow in the negotiations tomorrow. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker, I was very pleased to hear the Secretary of State talk about trust in his opening statement, because I think at the heart of this public policy  is trust. We need to make sure that the regulatory and legislative framework provides trust to consumers eating food off  They need to know that whey that buy in the supermarket is what it says on the label. -- that what they buy. The incident involving Findus UK is instructtive in that debate. Why I am speaking  is because when I asked the Secretary of State the question  his answer led me to believe that he was not in possession of the facts. And on this occasion, I have a rdge suspicion it wasn't his fault. I think at best, it was because very clever crisis public relations at obfuscated the facts. But I also think it might be possible that people have been deliberately withholding the facts, from the minister and his department, and in order to make my case on that, I need to go through the time line of  There is one thing I want to come out of my contribution to this debate today, and that is for the minister and his ministerial team to redouble their efforts when they scrutinise what went on at  So here is what I think happened with the time line I have assemblyed in the last 24 hours since the minister last did his  On Tuesday 29th January, Findus Group had initial test results from the euro Finn lab in Germany that subjected horsemeat DNA entered their beef lasagne  By Wednesday 30th January, Findus UK decided to quarantine the beef lasagne in its wholesale  On Tuesday, at sop point over the next period of days, -- some point. They would have had confirmation of those initial lab results test, experts in the industry tell ne is usually within  I am working on the assumption they had confirmation of those test results by Thursday 31st. On Saturday 2nd February, Comigel wrote to Findus UK, asking them to withdraw their beef lasagne product, and explaining they couldn't guarantee the integrity of the supply chain of their products, from as early as August the previous year. And they wanted their beef products to be withdrawn. On Monday 4th February. Findus communicated this information to major UK retailers. And I understand that the big retailers started to withdraw those products late on Monday evening. On Wednesday 6th February, the rest of us understood this. The Sun newspaper revealed it in a news  Then on late Thursday, late afternoon of Thursday 7th February, the company confirmed that horpltd was contained within their beef lasagne products, in a late afternoon announcement. On Friday  -- horsemeat. On Fridayth my researchers in West Brom Mick bought a Findus frozen lasagne in a shop in my constituency, still available to my constituents. And yet yesterday, the minister announced on Saturday 9th February, he had a conversation with the boss of the sister company to Findus UK  With that time line, I think there are already a number of searching questions we need to put  I would like to share them with the remaining minister tons frontbench. I know they can't ant it --ance it straight way but I would like to get them on the  If first is why, when the company had a reasonable suspicion that their supply chain was in some way contaminated or whatever world you want to use, on Tuesday 29th, why did they not issue an immediate withdrawal of products, a product  and a refund strategy for kist mer? These were frozen goods people stored in their freezers the eat at some point in the future, and so the refund strategy would have been important. It was obviously important enough to the  those test results, that they took a decision to quarantine products as early as Wednesday. But not remove products from the retail  I would like to know, on what day did the lab results  beyond doubt, that there was horsemeat in in Findus food? That would be the day that beyond reasonable doubt any company that adhered to basic forms of corporate social responsibility would have pressed the red button. The company said they were informed on Saturday 2nd February, in writing, by  that their supply chain was contaminated. I would like to know when they were told by telephone and or by email. Finally,  when they were told on Saturday 2nd February, that their second and third tyre suppliers could not guarantee the ingredients in the product, did they not urgently and immediately issue a product recall on the Saturday, leaving to it the Monday evening. Why do I think this is important? I honestly say this to ministers of both sides of the House, on this. What ever your view of markets are, and obviously, there is going to be a difference between the two ministers sitting there and, and me from my side, but you might be the most driest economist, the greatest adherent of laissez faire in the  yet still, this is a  It is a market failure that needs addressing. In my side of the political and economic  this is probably the most perfect piece of predatory capitalism I have ever seen. Because Findus UK was a company in  Private equity investors took possession of the company in  and started putting pressure on the supply chain. They refinanced the company. And I think that pressure led to corporate failure and the failure for them to do the right thing. It is how capitalism eats its young. They gobble up our money and health. They scoff down our dignity, and our children's safety. We eat whatever they put in the box. And they call it whatever they like. I  There is one man who doesn't include, who isn't included on that list. And his name is Mr Dael Morrison who right now is sitting on the 43rd floor of his Manhattan office, in Wall Street, failing to get a grip of the biggest food fraud this country has probably ever seen. That is the failure of capitalism, whatever side of the House you sit on.Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. The chairman of the Select Committee was right when she said that when this matter was first identified in Ireland, about four weeks' ago, there were two separate issues that were  The first was that there was a small amount of contamination of beef products by another species, and this was quite clearly an example of negligence or poor management. But when it was identified that 29% of horsemeat had been found in a beef product, this was quite clearly a deliberate  in order to make an exorbitant pruft. It was then, and is now clear that this is a criminal activity, and must be treated as such. But I don't believe that that was seized upon by the Irish officials early enough in the process. Illegal meat trading has been a widespread and persistent crime, but because of the regulation that we have in this  it has been largely or totally eliminated. It is -- noticeable that the problems we are facing have their origins really outside the UK. But criminal gangs involved in the smuggling of goods, including drugs and people traffics are also likely, we know to be involved in illegal meat trading. The profits are high, and the penalties are usually very moderate. Apart from the adull tration of  other form os criminal activity include introducing unfit meat which has been condemned for human consumption back into the human food chain. Of course, there has been the illegal importation into this country of bushmeat. That has been largely eliminated by the use of sniffer dogs in Heathrow. These are all criminal activities. Now the Secretary of State is right to say that there is... Yes, find. I am not sure whether he is aware. When we ran the UK bushmeat  l almost a decade ago.

We don't know at the moment who are the victims of the fraud, and and who are the perpetrators of the  Until we can get there, we will not have completed the work. Just to reflect on it, the ultimate victims of the fraud are always the consumerer who have been duped into eating a product they did not wish to eat and did not want to eat. I can say that because of the excellent trace glablt the UK food  that meat produced and sold as British in the UK is safe and unadull traited.

I could mention a number of particular butchers, but I'd probably miss out one or two very worthy local tradespeople. For a long time they've had to compete against large supermarkets who have once again shown that their first interest is in their shareholders, rather than their consumers and their suppliers. It's time to repay our local butchers with our custom. Thank you very much, Mr Deputy  We've heard a lot in this important debate about producer  I just want to detain the House for a few minutes about the interests of consumers. And to remind the House that even as we speak there are mums and dads, too, hovering over the frozen food cabinet of their corner shop, of their supermarket or their favourite frozen food store looking at their favourite frozen food product and saying - is this what is says it is? And for those ordinary mums and dads up and down the country it is not enough for ministers to hide behind this quango and the other quango, in as much as this horsemeat scandal has clear public health implications. Possible implications, but implications nonetheless. In as much as there is a public health  responsibility falls squarely and -- fairly and squarely to Government. We are relieved in the House today to understand that at this point there is no evidence that antibiotics and other drugs have entered the food chain. That is what we know today. But we know in the past, from other food scandals lake this, what you know  may change week-on-week and it is the public health issue here which makes it an issue for  I would say this to the House: it is a belief by the public, as old as this Chamber itself, that when it comes to the adult racial of food stuffs, whether it is adulteration, of food stuffs, whether it is watered milk in the Victorian age or lasagnes now, they look to Government for to take be responsibility. The other thing, Mr Deputy Speaker, we should not forget that that is scandal that affects the very poorest in our community and their children. Because who really is eating ï¿½1 lasagneies and so-called value burgers? Who buys those things except the very poor nest communities like mine and they are very often faeding them to children. And when I -- feeding them to  And when I hear - oh, you would have to eat an awful lot of these things to for it to have any discernable detriment to health. I have to put it to the minister that there are a lot of families who eat an awful lot of these foods and they need assurances as to its  not ministers hiding heend  And it must concern, it must concern anyone taking an interest in this, that the whistle was blown on this issue, not by the FSA here in England, but by the FSA  What does it say about the processes and procedures happening in the British Isles? There are issues about the break-up and reorganisation of the FSA. There are issues about the loss of Trading Standards officers at a local level. And there are also serious issues, for sometime, about the cuts in the meat hygiene  So for ministers to say the ultimate responsibility lies somewhere else, this is not something that the British public will accept or believe for a second and it's no coincidence that in the British media, whether it's a media that ostensibly supports the Government or doesn't support the  this issue has been headlining days, has been headline news for some days now and I believe will continue to be headline news, until it plays  Because, historically, there has been no issue of greater concern to British families than the quality of the food that they  And one of the issues that arises from this horsemeat scandal, even at this point, is the fundamental question of the price of cheap food. What is happening along the food chain is this relentless pressure and relentless pressure for decades, to drive down  drive down costs at the farm  Drive down costs at the production and manufacturing level. And drive down costs at a retail level and I'm afrid that constant pressure on cost is not just -- I'm  Is not just that. There are sections of the British community that want to eat and cannot afford the expensive product. The pressure on cost comes from the massive retail chains of which we are... I think my honourable friend is making a really powerful point and that is this it is not just driving down cost that is the issue but the consequence of that has also been to drive down quality. And isn't it really invidious that the products that are being sold as beef  in some cases haven't even come into contact with a cow? I entirely agree with my honourable  The pressure on cost means inevitable pressure on quality and far from cutting back institutions like the meat hygiene service, far from reorganising and destabilising  the Government should be putting more resourcess and more effort into guaranteeing the quality of food right down to the cheapest products bought by the poorest members of our community. I want to make progress.  my honourable friend has made a very important point, which actually relates to my point on the pressures on cost and the business pressures about the delay by Findus in withdrawing the product. It seems to be the case that Findus delayed in withdrawing the product until after the weekend, so it could move another00 thousand units and billionster its profit. And this is what -- and bolster its  This is what I mean about the pressures that are down on - which are making sure that our  even at the lowest cost, can purchase quality product.

We are debating this position in Parliament and our constituents are wondering if the processed meat product of their choice is actually  he is sitting in his skyscraper in Manhattan, oblivious  so long as he can see the share price of Findus going in the right way. So I am saying to the House this - that there are public health issues here. There are public health concerns that need to be answered. That the quality of our food stuffs is too important merely to be left to the moral sense of private equity predators and I say to the House,  it seems to me this is an issue which has a long way to run and Government should not be hiding behind civil servants. It should not be hiding behind quangos. It must expect - it must accept its moral responsibility for the quality of food that our people purchase in the shops and it must accept its moral responsibility for any possible threat to public health. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. I'm very pleased to follow the honourable member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington. In many ways I'm keen to continue the theme that  although possibly from a different perspective. There are many other members in this House who know a will the more about traceability, supply chain  etc, but I have been doing quite a lot of work when it comes to the food system as a whole and lets abe frank, we are facing a crisis in the food system. It's not actually the crisis of replacement horsemeat or the issues that we are actually addressing today. These,  are the symptoms. They are symptoms about the crisis around the cost of food. We have a food system particularly in this country that is designed around food that is cheap. It is the business model that's developed over many decades and it is very much that this particular business model is changing, that we find that we are seeing fraud within our food system.  price rises have been particularly dramatic over the last  32% increase in prices in the last five years, which is double the EU average. Answer the problem is actually going to Go get worse. In April, we're likely to see a significant price increase due to the American  The Russians have been imposing intermittent restriction  And extremely worrying,  who signed a debt swap with the Chinese, islikeing to secure that -- is looking to secure that debt swap with food  The Ukraine has been acting as Europe's traditional hedging supply for cost reduction when it comes to raw commodities.  the crisis is that the era of cheap food is now over. And we all need to put in place policies and strategies to achieve the very  but smoothing the transition to a higher-priced food sector and ensure that families, families that the honourable lady was talking about, that families, despite that rise in food, are able to feed their families, with quality food and with assurance that the food that they are putting on their table is what it says on the package.  I haven't actually heard from the opposition any strategies to actually address this particular fundamental issue that we are facing globally, so let me put some thoughts to the minister. Firstly, in supermarkets and possibly us politicians must start to be straight with the public about rises in food prices. Maybe after this disaster we will start it face up to these realities. Because it's not the supermarkets or manufacturers who are absorbing the price rises, it's the consumer. Horsemeat replacement has to be just as much about the result of a flued business model. The only way to square that ludicrous circle of cheap food in the shops with rocketing food prices in the supply  So, consumers are suffering not just from fraudulent food but also the reduction in best ingredients and substituting with the equivalent of what some people call "arterial polyfiller." Your ï¿½1 cottage pie in your local freezer shop that the honourable lady  It maybe the same price. It is the same price it has been for the last five years, but will it have the same content? Will it contain less meat and more high fruk tos corn syrup? Have you seen how much fresh air you are now buying when you reach for serial packets and 60% of all were ducts on all supermarkets are now on  some misleading as Which? Which? The consumers' social has rightly highlighted. I'm sure that Government is taking a new look at poll sism over the last 15 years Government has policy. Over the last 15 years Government has desolved the relationship between consumer and food to the supermarkets. This has never been right but is impossible to continue and we need to reengineer our policy around consumers not producers and retailers. We need to move from a cheap as chips model to one where we have to value food. And this new food cost reality may ultimately be better for our public and our producers. But the transition will and is already very  When you talk to the poorest families in my constituency, they can't afford to go to supermarkets any more. It's like asking them whether they go to Harvey Nicholls of Harrods. Pond  alDane Lidl, the corner shop and street markets are where they are getk their food -- Aldi. Chips from the takeaway will be dinner for the family. Some of our strategies are interesting. We talk about cooking and how we can eat more healthly.

Ewondered if I could pre-empt a point he is coming to she says that we we have to be realistic about the value of food and that seeps to be me she was preparing us all to pay more for our food. But how does that equate with our sympathy with the poorest families in her constituency? How will they mange to make that leap -- manage to make that leap if incomes stay as low? I think it's a false choice that. There is an issue we have stopped valuing food and we have stopped being able to use food. One thing I would say has been a huge sort of asset and that is this week Michael  the Secretary of State for education announced that food preparation and cooking will be on the National Curriculum. These are things where we are creating a more resilient public. Global food prices are rising and we must support the poorest families in that transition. I don't believe we need to eat less well, because despite the fact that food prices  what we need to do is have greater transparency, much more resilience and greater skills to be able to use food more effectively.  many ways leading on from that  For a poorer families will be making cheaper choices so it is  absolutely cuebl, that labelling is transparent. --  Where is the flash on that cottage pie saying 30% less meat? So Government needs to also look at tighten some of the regulations round food promotions. Products that are less expensive are going on promotion at more expensive  retailers are shortening the period of time that a product needs to be on full price, before a discount is a true discount. This is another form of consumers absorbing these price rises, but not absorbing them transparently. So we need to have a sum my not just on food safety -- sum mit but a commission on the whole food  focusing on the consumer and ensuring that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the public, who are going to have to manage this painful transtprition a cheap as chips food model to a more expensive one. Families should be able to food themselves as well in the new model, if we provide the Lack of transparancy or have actually experienced food fraud.  in my view, is the only the beginning of this food crisis, if we don't face up to the realities and become the champion of the consumer. Thank you. I want to start by congratulating my friends in the shadow DEFRA team for pursuing this issue, relentlessly and for choosings it as a topic for opposition debate  We had statement yesterday, but there is a lot more to be flashed about this issue. I welcome the opportunity to take part in today's debate. It is an important issue not just because it has exposed the scandal of horsemeat adulterating our food chain but the spotlight it throens meat industry more generally, what Felicity Lawrence referred to as the hidden unsavoury food world, in which live animals are transported vast distance across borders for slaughter before being shipped back in blocks of frozen off cuts that maybe stored for monced before being ground down to unrecognisable ingredients. Lord has kins, a  so someone who knows  has warned the there is endemic institutional fraud in the food industry. So it is not just enough to get to the bottom where there is unidentified horsemeat or donkey in meat products on sale in  or whether halal products are contaminated with pork, we need to look at the whole of the meat industry because who knows what other scandals are coming to light. The E -- some may be familiar with the controversy in the USA over what the meat industry likes to refer to as lean finely textured beef or boneless lean beef trim, which sounds fine, but it is more commonly known as pink slime which sounds lis appetise, it is used as a filler in beef products and is pro made by producing sinew and heating it to 100 degrees  The recovered beef ..

There is something that has become known as white slime in meat products. It is officially known as mechanically separated meat or mechanically recovered meat. This is most likely to be used in very processed meat products like burgers or pies. It is a pacelike product by forcing chicken or turkey under high pressure to get every last scrap of meat off the bone. There have been questions about the safety of this, and limits on how much can be used in a food product, for example no more than 20% is allowed to be used in hotdogs but the consumers don't rile lice this is there. There is advanced meat recovery which separated meat from bone by scraping the meat from the bone. That is typically used in hot bogs.

He highlighted the, in the when he was talking about the relent less search for profits an article that says the Findus products came from Luxembourg which were supplied by meat from a company in south-west France which acquired frozen meat from a sip rot trader, supplyed from the Netherlands and they were supplied from Romania, how messed up has our food system become? All this is a far cry from the sort of meat that many members praised in yesterday's statement on horsemeat were talking about the importance or the advice built of buying local meat from a local farm, sold by a local butch e whose path from pasture to plate is a matter of public record ch I have had people saying to me they take local source so far they know the name of the cow they are consuming. It is easy to say that, in an ideal world people would be looking to organically reared product, but the fact is that is very expensive and  you can say that people should try to cook their own foot food and source it locally instead of buying ready made meels. I am sure many MPs grab a ready meal on their way home after a vote.

It is slightly challenging to follow the honourable lady for Bristol east who gave perhaps once of the best cases I have ever heard for vegetarianism. I fear I am going to veer off into specifics, given my past job experience, working for a passport issuing organisation and just a bit about how horse passports are issued and the value or otherwise of the National Equine  I apologise if that gets a little specific for other members but I think there is clarity that needs to be given, both to the problems and benefits of horse  but also specifically to  which certainly does not  -- neck, did not do anything to assist with trace built and what drugs or otherwise might have been given to equines. -- National Equine Database.

I endorse the policy of one 100% testing of horse carcasss that have been slaughtered in the UK, for  You simply cannot identify whether a horse has been fed bute or not by looking at its passport. We heard from the opposition  a comment about whether bute had been injected into horses but bute is not injected. Only in very rare cases is this substance given intravenously, it is fed  within food stuff. So not only is the possibility of cross contamination easy, but bute is a useful drug which is used for in many cases elderly horses that are slightly lame, it prolongs their  enables them to have a better quality of life and it is very very cheap, which means for both veterinary surgeons and horse  it is incredibly popular, because if your much loved family pony can have its life extended by five or ten year, by admin straiting one sachkpwra of bute day you will do it. There in comes some of the problem because it is readily available from vets and while I would not, not say that horse owners are irresponsible, if you have a ready supply prescribed for one horse as I might do in the If it has been to the joint measurement board and been measured it'll be chipped. But if it isn't, if it is an ordinary pony out in the New Forest or kept at home and not used in competition, it is unlikely to have a micro-chip. When it is prevented for slaughter it may or may not have a chi. We heard the honourable lady say earlier it was legal to buy a micro-chip for  yes, it is, but it is illegal it insert it into an equine. Whilst that check is there, actually I would argue it is probably much more common for horses to be presented at UK slaughter houses without a micro-chip, with a pos port which may or may not have come from -- passport. Which may or may not have come from a recognised  I threw up two passports, one from the oldest equine charity in the country, swi a fully pucker passport and another one an Irish passport with a beast which has been through goodness knows how many sales in Ireland but yet it's the British passport that doesn't show that drugs have been administered and the Irish passport that does. To move on to the National Equine  there are in the region 3 million horses in the UK, some registered on the data base,  I don't know if the lady opposite looked at NED I have. Fantastic record but it didn't show you where a horse was kept or what drugs had been administered or what they were used for. There was no way of telling. Why I personally lament the loss of NED because I cannot look up whether a competition record has been accurately recorded and therefore based around the potential value or ability of a pony zit show where I kept it?

The only way to this is through 100%  I would argue when you look at what has gone on abroad that is where the testing has to be, of any meat coming into country because who knows what has happened in romain tan slaughter houses and other parts of the country. I'm slightly disappointed that my honourable friend for Thanet is no longer in his place because I think she has done great work on the transport of live animals and exports and I think that plays a massive part in the debate. We have massive part in the debate. We have you can achieve it with the European Union, but we have to get to a point where animals are transported far shorter distances where they are not crossing an entire continent and not only where we are looking at food traceability and safety but at their welfare.  Mr Deputy speaker. I'm delighted to follow the honourable  As a former minister for the  I remember the days of the horse passports and I always had my doubts that they would actually be able to do the job on Bute and she's ablely ill traited that. Mr Deputy Speaker -- illustrated  Perhaps there has been no matter time to be a food criminal. It is a time of deeper economic recession across Europe. The food supply train is extraordinaryly complex with swift transport of goods and product across international boreders with multiple regulatory frame works on safety and labelling and of course in Romania the sudden enforcement of a recent law to remove horses and carts from the country's roads. Let's be clear, there has been the most extraordinary case of corporate blindness involved in this scandal. Look at what Tim Smith the former Chief Executive of the FSA and now head of food security at Tesco had the affront it tell the Select Committee on  He told the committee that he thought this was th was a rogue event and that the FSA Ireland happened to do DNA testing on precisely that day when a rogue consignment of horsemeat just happened to the present. The most extraordinary thing, though, is not his pathetic naivety, but the fact that he is still in his job at Tesco two weeks later. We know that excuses which begin with the words, "Just one rogue trader or one rogue reporter", have an unhappy history in this place. What Tesco sought to dismiss at one bad day at the abattoir has affected virtually every major retailer not just in the UK but across continnant. Tesco, Aldi,  are joined any European supermarkets. Process chain for cheap meat products was ripe for criminal activity. Findus in the UK was supplied by Comigel in France, who supply retailers in 16 different countries. The contaminated Findus products game from the Comigel in Luxembourg factory but the meat from the South West of France from a company called Spanghero whose parent company acquired the meet from a siep riot trader, and who -- acquired the meat from a Cypriot trader and who in turn got the meat from from the Netherlands and tra trader sourced the meet from  This information came not from our Secretary of State, but from France's consumers affairs  Of course in France many people eat horse but just like us, they do in the want to eat horse when they think they are eating and paying for bee. Now, of course more than 25 abattoirs in Romania are properly licensed to butcher and export horsemeat but it must be properly labelled as horse. So the key question in this fraud is at what point in this complex food chain did someone willfully take off a label that said "horse" and replace it with a label that said " Today's motion rightly calls on the Government to ensure that police and fraud specialists investigate that criminality. I give way. The honourable member, Rt Hon member is quite right to want to identify the point at which the fraud took place. But it would be more than one person who did it and,  it is likely to be an extremely complex and well- organised operation, wouldn't he agree? I absolutely agree with the honourable gentleman. That'sives pleased that I was very pleased that the Shadow Secretary of State had informed the authorities to look at this particularly because they had that remit. How is it then that all these supermarkets across Europe had singularly failed to identify the risk of substitution and contamination of processed meat  Remember these are the supermarkets that drive our farmers to despair when they reject whole consignments of perfectly good fruit and vegetables because they are misshapen or blemished. The point is not just that supermarkets are involved with that treatment of farmers it is the fact that supermarkets can and do minute detailed checks on their products when it is in their interests. Tesco's and their I willk simply cared more that the pears they sold where the right conicaled shape than the processed meat we bought for them was contaminated and of a different species. Over the last  our UK formers have done a magnificent job in improving animal welfare and food hygiene. Introduction of pride marks such as the red tractor scheme gives confidence that theed if they are eating has a short supply train from local farmers who operate to the highest standards. Responsibility for policy for labelling relies with DEFRA. DEFRA ministers must now decide we need clarity oned if label that is will identify the country of origin. The lack of mandatory country of origin on food labelling, places British farmers at a disadvantage. British people want to buy British-farmed produce with can dense. Mr Deputy Speaker I have not always in the past quoted with total approval with press releases from the Countryside Alliance but on this matter they are entirely right. They say the lack of mandatory country of origin food labelling continues to place British farmers at a disadvantage when much of competition comes from producers in countries which are not subject to such robust animal welfare standards and the associated costs. I want to turn to the issue, briefly of phenylbutazone. The point is simply this: there were 156 tests done last year, of which resulted in a positive presence of Bute.  of course there were 9,000 horses that went through British  If one applies the same  thatp means many more carcasses could have been contaminated with Bute. As the honourable lady says, not all of those horses who had taken Bute may have been picked up by the test. But there is a real emission in the figures which have been presented to us in the number of positives and that is the number of prosecutions. If there were nine positive tests, why were there not nine positive prosecutions? The FSA today announced its new system of positive release and this move away from a desk-base system of audit is welcome. No horse carcass will be released in the future in the food chain until it has been tested negative for Bute. But there is more that the FSA must be in power to do. The FSA must have the task of making risk-based assessments of the supply chain and instructing supermarkets about the number of physical product check that is they must do on the basis of the volume of product that they shift and the length and complexity of their supply chain. FSA must also receive, as of right, all results from the tests that the retailers carry out whether under instruction for the FSA or on their  Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to say one positive thing about what the Government is doing: we've heard in the past week that children are going to be taught how to cook in schools. That is  They will no longer just have processed food in a microwave. They will be able to cook things from fresh produce from themselves and that'll be a real advance. Can I say what a pleasure it is to follow the honourable member for  who despite having an urban constituency speaks with great knowledge and experience with the food industry and has a reputation for doing such. Can I draw members attention to my declaration of financial interest before I speak. I would like to start by saying that this is not a topic that has appeared over the last two-and-a-half years, this is something that has been a long-time  And, to a certain extent some of the comments that have come from the other side of the chamber, certainly stick in my throat like a dodgy burger and they speak as if this is something which this Government has created. This is something which has been changing since the Second World War, when the proportion of cash an individual spent on their food bill was much larger than it is today. Families would have spent 60% of their income on food. Today it is a  much smaller figure than that.  we've lost context of how valuable our food is. I made the analogy with televisions. I think you can say the same about  You would never buy second-hand cheap car tyres from somebody who offered you them on the cheap because you would instantly recognise that our individual safety is at risk. But we seem to have got ourselves as a  into this position, where we are happy to seat price of food fall and be driven down and we've lost the concept of how valuable our food is. I think that has rendered us into this position where we are today. I'll also draw attention to the honourable member for Brent, who made reference to the fact that the education Secretary is going to reintroduce cooking and food within the curriculum. It is a great step  Today we have two generations of consumer who have lost contact with how food is produced and lost contact with how to cook raw product. I think that again is to the detriment of our As to how to cook food and deal with raw product, I think consumer can find themselves in a position where they can buy better quality food for the same money, if they learn to shop about and source it from the right places. I want to draw attention to the fact that UK agriculture finds itself today in a different place to the rest of the  That is no fluke, I think that comes through bitter  frankly, the BSE crisis in the beef industry in the United Kingdom taught that industry some very valuable lessons about consumer confidence and about how the consumer needed to understand and know and have confidence in that product, we stand here today, in the knowledge that if you go to your local butcher's shop, not only will that butcher be able to sell you a high quality cut of meat or a very high quality processed  but will be able to identify not the only animal that beefburger came from, but the mother of that animal, and the father of that animal. That is the level of traceability that is within the UK butchery industry  and I think that is something that when UK consumers understand that, and certainly, when you compare that with some of the comparisons the honourable lady for Bristol east made about the processed meat industry and Frankly, some of the products which are sold  which frankly normal people would not recognise as being  I think there is a really strong message to deliver there on behalf of the UK meat industry. And it is again, it is not rocket  the shorter you make that  the easier it is to have that traceability, and I think labelling again, is going to be very important, as we move forward. We have heard from the opposition how labelling should be more prominent and should be put on our  yet when they were in power there were several Private Members Bills, and lobbying from what was the then the opposition to try and improve labelling, to make sure that consumers understood where and how their food was being  I will give away. Does he agree with me there was nothing unclear about the labelling, it said beef where in fact it was  Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that is fundamental the issue. That could not happen, frankly in a UK situation because you have environmental health officers and you have Trading Standards officers that are checking that paper trail that goes right back. But if somebody from a fraudulent .. I will give way. I do agree with what he said, but surely the issue here is about criminality and criminality is international. If a criminal changes the label, then it doesn't matter blit is British or abroad, consumers won't have confidence. I ackowledge that  The point I am making is within the UK industry, the traceability and the opportunity to change those labels, simply is not  Because you have registered vets in every abattoir in the United Kingdom, watching that line, checking those carcasses, they are stamped and they are marked. They cannot be changed. And when you buy  a block of frozen meat, from an international buyer, it is very easy to pull the label off  that says beef and slap on one that says another thing or  reverse that process.  I think that is a add state of affairs where we find  Consumers want to know what they are eating, and I think today we are in a position where I can actually set up my own little  I could buy in Brazilian  and I could make chicken pies in my kitchen, and I could sell those products as Nottinghamshire chicken pie. I think we need to look at the labelling process, much closer, so that the process industry tells our consumers what it is that they are  where that has come from. The final point I want to make, is at the end of all of this, the consumer does have the power, the consumer can choose where they source their products from. They can choose to go to a supermarket, or they can choose to go to a local small independent high street  And they can shop round, and they can make those decisions.  where that becomes challenging, and I acknowledge it becomes very  is where we get to the bottom of those people who are struggling to make ends meet, where they are struggling to find the doosh go and buy those products, and I think which is why we need to have a regulatory system they can have confidence in, that they can  that they acknowledge. My final message is this weekend, when you think about what you want to have for dinner, get out there, go to your local butcher, look him in the eye and say where has this animal come from? Tell me about it. You can eat that dinner with confidence in the knowledge you are buying good quality locally produced meat. Five minutes. Thank  Can I apologise for not being here at the start of the debate. It's a great pleasure to follow my honourable friend from Sherwood. He made some strong points about the traceability of the product that we produce in this country from, the time we produce it as farmers in the field to, the time it is slaughtered and processed, we know exactly where those animals have come from we have the red tractor  which identifies the farm assurance and we are certain that we are buying the right product, and we know it is beef. But I want to say to the chamber clearly this  we haven't just suddenly  this has been happening over years now, when I was a member of the European Parliament for ten years on the agriculture committee we were saying time and time again we want greater traceability. We want to follow the products across  We want to be confident it is not just a paper trail but we have physical inspection of this meat and meat product. None of this has actually happened in the past. I think this is, if there is a silver lining to be had, this is very much ap wake up call now, to be certain that we put in place a process that we can identify the product and know and the consumer can be confident when he or she  they are buying beef and not horsemeat. That leads me clearly on to the nact this is  and that is criminal  So therefore we should be able to buy, even a cheap beefburger in the shops and be confident of it. I think we have talked a great deal today about education of how we cook our meat and that is a great step forward, but also we have got to a stage where many more people eat processed food, rightly or wrongly, and we are not actually going to roll that tpwhabg this chamber, so therefore when a consumer goes out and buys a beefburger, even a cheap  he or she should be confident it has beef nit and it has not got horse. Also, if you look at the types of meat that we have used over the year, the slow roasting joints and all these types of meat that no longer people actually want to spend the time cooking or perhaps have the time to  then much of this meat and meat product x go into those cheaper burgers, so there is no excuse whatsoever, and I I would say to you clearly, as the member for Sherwood said, if you look at  I think in 1970, we were spending over 30% of our income on  now, we are spending about 12% of our average incomes on food, so therefore the amount of percentage of income that people are spending on food has dropped  but they still should be able to be confident of what  and we do expect the food industry to stand up and be counted. And to be certain when they are selling their product in the shop, that it is exactly what they say it  And we have seen supermarkets use a great deal of muscle in the  and will move forward in the  to try and drive those  but in many ways you could argue this is of great benefit the consumer, it only benefit if they are getting a product they can trust, and be confidence in. I think, you know, we have to be careful today, when we just go against all processed  Because processed food isn't necessarily bad for us. It is processed in the way it showers, it contains what it should on the  then we can eat it with  And we can do it as far as that British food that is produced under our farm assured  soy look forward to what the minister is going to say in  It I think it's a case now of making sure we have confidence in our food industry, that we actually can bring in a food labelling system, which will clearly identify the country of  of those principle meat ingredients in a processed product. So we know where they come from so if we are concerned that they have come from other pars of Europe or across the world, where we done don't have the same confidence in the food kwharpbgs do not buy that  But at the moment we only have processed in the EU, processed  and we don't actually know where those principle products have come from. So I would urge the ministers when they go Europe to make sure that we finally get this prop -- proper labelling so we can identify where our food has come  then we can act much quicker in bringing those criminals to book. That is what they are. Criminals who have put the wrong meat into the brger and there could be problems with that, so I look forward to what the ministers have  Thank you. Manufacture  This being an important well-informed debate and I want to thank some members individually for  The honourable lady for Thirsk and Malton. My honourable friend the member for West Bromwich East. The honourable lady for south han net, the honourable lady for Romsey and Southampton north. Brent north, the honourable member nor Sherwood and the honourable member for Tiverton and Honiton. Excellent, well informed speeches, because there can be few subjects for debate more important to us as individuals and as families than what we eat, what we feed our children. I am just sorry Mr Deputy Speaker the Secretary of State was too busy to listen to a single peach in this debate after he delivered his own  I know, yesly give way. I think it's very important Mr Deputy superb that the Secretary of State is having the phone meeting with I he mentioned to the House, with the Dutch minister, right at the moment. I think it is important we do make those connections. I look forward to his reemergence in the chambefrplt I am grateful to him for that clarification. I know he has a busy schedule. He told us so, he told us he was meeting again today but I thought that was the meeting that, with the food industry. I would have congratulated him. Then I realised today meetsing was not convened at  it wasn't convened Azerbaijan a response the horsemeat scandal ch it was convened last October to give the Secretary of State an opportunity to talk about waste and GM food. It is good to see Mr Deputy Speaker, at least when it comes to the Secretary of State's diary he has noish shoe with changing the label. No issue. This is such an important issue, for that reason at loan, it is vital we as consumers have full confidence what we are eating is exactly what it says on the PACT. We as consumer need to know ministers are fighting our corner. I have to say, that consumers watching today's performance by the Secretary of State particularly yesterday's statement will not have been encouraged. There remain a very large number of unanswered questions I hope the minister of state will answer in his response. Some are questions that were asked  but which were left unanswered or ignored by the Secretary of State, who felt unable to answer them even today. The Secretary of State told the House yesterday he first became aware of the horsemeat issue on 150th  Earlier in the same  he said "On the 159  the FSA was notify fid the food safety authority of island of the result of its survey of processed beef products." Can the minister of state clarify if that communication on 15th January was the first occasion that the FSA were even aware that such tests were taking place? Were they contacted by the Irish authorities at any point, between mid-November and the 15th January, to alert them to the fact that concerns about Atul tragts of beef sparked an analysis f so when was that first contact made. If so when were ministers told? If not why not? -- adulteration. I wanted to make mention to a speech which did as the honourable lady for Romney had  sorry for... Romsey,  For Romsey had said it was an excellent advert for vegetarianism. Which I did try once for about a month but gave up because I can't stand mushrooms. But she asked a sensible question about an EU regulation and my honourable friend for Brent north echoed that today. A deregulation that would limit to 50% the amount of the fat and connective issue that can be used to bulk up  And she asked about reports that the Government is seeking a derogation from that  The Secretary of State dismissed her in an extremely curt and I have to say arrogant way, which I am sure being a gentleman he now regrets, but can the minister of state now answer that question? Is the Government seeking to exempt the UK from a mesh that Will the minister who prides himself on listening to the advice of the FSA heed her advice? Does the Government have a view on this at all? The Minister of State - he will get his chance to respond. He loves to chupbter from a settentry  I spent two years on the Science and Technology Committee. He was a veritable ray of sunshine during those many overseas visits. He was great company and I have to say that he seems to have gone into an awful bad mood since he went on to the Government front bench. I'm sure he will - I'm sure you want to get back on to horsemeat. Back in the saddal right now, Mr Deputy  The Minister of State warned a few weeks ago we should not be talking down the British food industry. He is right. But given the huge number of jobs the industry supports and the importance to our economy, does he recognise that the industry can be undermined by other factors? Does he accept ministerial inaction and indecisiveness can be far more damaging to the industry? In mid-November, Irish authorities were concerned enough about contamination of meat were ducts,  adluteration of meat  some of which were headed  that the initiated tests  according to UK ministers, informing the UK Government of their initial concerns. Four weeks ago Irish authorities alerted the UK Government that they had discovered horsemeat in burgers stocked in a number of UK supermarkets. Last Monday it was revealed that pies and pasteries labelled as halal and served in UK prison has tested positive for pig  Last Thursday, reports emerged that the scandal had spread from frozen burgers to frozen ready meals cue a sudden blush of action from the Secretary of State. On Saturday he got around it meeting the British food industry to discuss the crisis. His food minister had at least got around it meeting them before, once, one week  As high honourable  the Secretary of State said  Crisis - what crisis? At  yesterday the Secretary of State Deaned to come to the House to berait members for having the you had as aity to question him about the mess. As with the ash dyeback issue he has taken a relaxed attitude, an attitude I have to tell him is not shared by consumers and families. When food sales falls and confidence in the industry plummets, no doubt they'll reach for the microphone to decry scaremongering. Who knows, maybe they will be forced to eat a Findus lasangne live on TV. It will not be this side of the House that will be responsible for the collapse in  Consumers and voters will know where the blame lies. A number of members have highlighted the lack of ang active criminal investigation. When pressed on this yesterday by my colleague, the shadow Secretary of State, the Secretary of State said she went on and on about the police. Really? The Secretary of State really thinks that that kind of patronising conda sending manner is the way to win support in the House on such an issue? Can I suggest to the Secretary of State and to his deputy that a bit of humility will not go amiss. I say this as a non- practitioners myself, but I hear it works wonders. Even if ministerial action had so far been above criticism then such a manner would be inappropriate and ministers' actions so far have been far from being above crit is im. Fact the shadow Secretary of State -  In fact the shadow Secretary of State was right to go on about the police. The Secretary of State himself has repeatedly stated the adluteration is the result of an international criminal conspiracy and a straight fraud. In line with this the Irish Government confirmed on Monday 4th February that the guardia and fraud specialist has been called in. Last Friday the shadow Secretary of State passed details of more British companies alleged to have been involved in the scandal is the Serious Organised Crime Agency on Friday and the FSA on Saturday. On the same Friday the FSA revealed the police were involved but no live criminal investigation was act I have Yyesterday the Secretary of State said that until there is criminal action in this country, the police can to the take action. Is that really the case? Can he confirm to the House that he thinks criminals are present everywhere in  except in the United Kingdom?

We all know the value of processes locally. Many members have used this debate to promote local produce.

And the Secretary of State can dismiss misresponsibilities by saying that retailers have the ultimate be responsibility of the content of  Unless the Secretary of State wants the F removed from deaf ra, it is incumbent on him to act on the responsibilities he already has.

He also believes that the Government shouldn't get involved in the running of the go.. The SFA, as independent, does not mean that the Secretary of State is prevented  what kind of testing the plant will carry out. I'm going to wind up now, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are two types of Government: the Government whose ministers are so competent and confident and so on top of their brief that from the Opposition benches, Government looks easey. Then there is the other type a Government whose members never seem well-briefed or  who always seem to be behind the curve, making decisions  even then making the wrong decisions. Such the Government leaves the Opposition with a distinct impression that almost anyone else could do a  There is no doubt which category this Government falls into. In the few moments I have left to respond the debate, can I say I think this actually has been a broadly measured and constructive debate as is entirely appropriate on such a serious issue, slightly marred occasionally I have to say by those on the front bench opposite who want to introduce a party political element and seem blythely oblivious to the fact that the systems in place are now precisely the same as the system in place under the previous Government.  Mr Deputy Speaker, is that this is a shared problem a init's a shared response. It's a shared problem between the  this House, the food companies and the regulators. It's shared between countries, now across Europe, which are either implicated or are the victims of what may or may not be criminal  And it's shared by the police and investigating  who are now looking into what would appear to be, and  I have to qualify that, but it would appear to be, significant and which had-spread criminality. And what I -- wide-spread. There is only one person who is most  whose interests are  the consumer. It is the consumer who has been cheated when they take food off a supermarket shelf and are given something not on the label. I think there was a  despite occasional retarrical inteloops. I think there was sufficient common cause across  I looked at the mo, and most of this recycle the fact. I think it is therefore unexceptional. I find one particular part of the  however, is wrong and it actually suggests a frame of mind which I think the Opposition have at the moment. When they say "the Government to ensure that police and fraud specialists investigate the criminal networks involved." It is not for the Government to instruct the police in this country what it should investigate. It is certainly not for the Government in this country to require the police authorities in other Member States, as to what they should investigate.  on that basis, Mr Speaker, I will invite my colleagues not to support the motion today but nevertheless, I will acknowledge the amount in which we agree. Now, let's deal with some of the individual contributions. The honourable lady for Thirbe sk, and Maldon who I understand has gone --  The honourable gentleman took all my time. The honourable lady raised a very important issue which was mentioned by many others. My honourable friend, and the honourable member for Sherwood and Timer ton which is the importance of the traceability of meat in this country and the systems we have in  I think it is incredibly important that we emphasise that certainly there has not been the slightest suspicion so far raised that cut meat produced in this country is anything other than a very high quality indeed and we should take some comfort from that. She raised the issue about trace contamination. This is something that we need to look at, about whether less than% DNA contamination is anything other than environmental contamination, which is below a threshold. -- less  We are taking advice. I think it is important that we don't suggest something is adulterated when it has been simply sitting on a biemp's shelf next to the meat of another species. -- sitting on a butcher's shelve. I will look carefully at the other points and see if there are substance that we need to pursue. My honourable friend talked about fraud on a European scale. I agree. The honourable lady for Hackney and Stoke Newington, raised point I made at the beginning, which is the importance of the consumer. I think she then drew xeable conclusions into public health. She wants the assurance that I want for my constituents. I want my constituents and her constituents to be be a slaughtly assured that food on our supermarket shelves is safe it eat -- absolutely assured. Safety is the first priority. But the safety tests that we have carried out so far have not given any rise for concern on safety grounds and I think that that is something she needs it take back to her constituency. The honourable lady for South Thanet took a global view of food prices and raised some important points. The honourable lady from Bristol East gave a graphic description of some of the processes used in the process meat industry but can I distinguish between what she said and the point raised by the honourable member from Glasgow about this business about mince? Having a higher fat content in mince, as British mince has always had, does not mean that we should describe it as something  That is the point of the consultation on composition that we are carrying out. I'm sorry - I'm  do I not think it is helpful to say this is no longer mince, it is mince with fat and collagen added or something of that, because I don't think that is helpful to the consumer but we'll have a consultation on the matter. The honourable lady for Romsey and Southampton North talked with great knowledge about horse passports and the national equine data base and made the point I have been repeatedly making that actual lit national equine data base did nothing whatsoever in terms of  If we want to improve the passport system and I think there is a strong case actually for looking again at the passport  it is not on that basis that we need to look at it, but on the way in which they are issued and the content. Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable gentleman for Glasgow South raised a number of things. He suggested on this timing with the food standards authority of Ireland that somehow the FSA had failed - He suggested it was on the basis of intelligence.  can I tell him that it is explicitly rejected by the food standards authority of Ireland that they were working on an intelligence-based system.  it was not on suspicion that there was adluteration of material going into the UK that they were operating. As soon as they had confirmed results they shared them with the SFA, the SFA shared them with the Government and we've had the continuing process. I have to say we like to work on evidence before bringing prosecutions. We like to give the evidence to the police. I'm answering the question - that is  That they were not - they didn't have suspicion there was adulterated meat going into the  They were doing a routine test and notified us when they had adverse results. I think, Mr Deputy  that what we clearly need to express from this House is a message to food businesses, that their credibility and reputation is  They need to take the actions that we have agreed with  And that with these  these labyrinthine food supply networks, then they ought to consider whether providence is not a more important issue than profits. I think that's a lesson they need  There is a message to regulators we need to ensure systems in place across Europe work  We need to look at our own systems and see if we can work  including the horse passport system and we need to look whether the intelligence-based approach needs to be supplemented The question is as on the order  A many of that opinion The ayes to the right 236 the nos the left, 297. The ayes to the right 236, the noes the left,  So the noes have it. Unlock. Point of order. The Government lost in the High Court this morning and the High Court ruled that their job seek eer allowance regulations 2011 were unlawful. These are the regulations that force people on to  work fair. And if they refuse that work, as, if it is unsuitable to assist them in gaining employment, they then lose their benefits. These were declared  The Government put a statement saying "We intend to lay new regulations which will come into force immediately, enable us to continue to refer claimants to our schemes." those regulations have not been pubbished - published. I am told they will come into immediate force without a vote of the House and no opportunity to debate them. Could we ask the Government to to make a statement to clarify the position. A large number of people as a result of these regulations being unlawful will be able to claim back the benefits they lost as a result of the unlawful things levelled I found him. It seems that no regulations have yet been made and I suggest the Honourable Gentleman keeps in close touch with those who will be able to advise and how best to proceed. -- I thank him. We now come to the opposition motion relation to infrastructure. I informed a house that the Speaker had selected the amendment in the name of the Prime Minister. I now call Rachel Reeves to move the  Thank you. We have called this debate to edge the government to take action to invest in infrastructure projects, to create jobs and boost confidence in the  Also to strengthen our competitiveness for the future. We all recognise the importance of infrastructure investment. As the Prime Minister has said, getting construction projects of the ground is critical and the Chancellor  saying that investing in the economic future was the priority of the government, adding that infrastructure investment was "critical in laying the foundations for future economic success". But the grand rhetoric from the government has not been matched by Grand action.

Would she bent me in joining the government for the ï¿½600 million Heathrow investment they will be making?

We have lost more than 120,000 jobs in construction since this government came to power. I will give way again. I thank her. Would she joined me in joining -- in applauding the ï¿½12 million university construction contract in my constituency? That says it all.

Work has just begun and it will make a huge difference to my constituency. I wonder whether the next intervention from the opposite bench will congratulate the Chancellor on spending ï¿½12.8 billion less in three years compared with the plans inherited from the previous Labour  I thank the shadow minister for giving way and I hope I do not excite her too much to have her deliver her baby early. Can I ask her what she thinks about the fact that the government of once again kicked into the long grass the whole question of the congestion in the air traffic in the south-east of this country? Why is it that they are kicking this into the long grass? The reality is that it is weak leadership that means it is being kicked into the  No report from those charged with doing this review until the next Parliament. That is disappointing for businesses who wish to invest today.

I thank him for that. That is why we urged the government before the Autumn Statement to use the money from the 4G auction to start building 100,000 new affordable homes. That is why we urged the Chancellor to use a tax on bank bonuses to fund a job guarantee for young people. But the Chancellor did not listen. The Liberal Democrats clearly do not wish to listen. For every investor that is put off, for every job lost in the construction sector, we are losing ground to our global competitors. With the economy  with no growth over the  the case for action is now irrefutable. We need to bring forward public investment to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, to kick-start the flatlining economy and to get the construction industry moving again. I thank her for giving way. Would she not agree with me that the issue of the flat knowing of our economy and our failure to invest is having a major impact on young people? There are more people in my constituency out of work than six months ago and long-term youth unemployment is  I thank her for that  The reality is, there are close to one million young people out of work, a third of whom are long-term unemployed. Every one of them is not as telling their Rome potential wasted but it is a waste our economy. -- is not just having their own potential wasted. But there is still no sign of the government sharing the country's sense of urgency. Only 14% of the 576 projects in the infrastructure pipeline have started. Just 1% of those are said to be operational. The government record on infrastructure is a complete and utter shambles. Wherever you look, the strategy is failing to deliver. A perfect storm of uncertainty, incompetence and delay. I thank her for giving way. She has made an excellent speech and is talking about projects. Can I suggest that one project which might be considered seriously is the building of a dedicated rail freight line to Glasgow, linking all the industrial areas of Britain, able to take lorries on trains. Would she give that serious consideration? I know that is something he has worked carefully on and is discussing with ministers and shadow ministers. I think it is a scheme that is worth looking at.

I look forward to one of the Honourable Members opposite explaining why those are the policies they are supporting. I will give way.

Isn't it time we took lessons from growth economies like that and, indeed, Brazil who are investing ï¿½66 What we have to learn from other countries is you need a proper industrial strategy if you're going to create growth and job and win in the global race the Prime Minister talks about. Two weeks ago at Treasury questions, the Chancellor said that I was being creative with the facts when I said he is spending less than Labour planned on infrastructure investment. That I was being misleading on his record on investment. The Chancellor had to withdraw that slur and Channel 4 looked into the Chancellor's claims and they say latist figures from the Office of National Statistics show Mr Osborne's claim to have spent more on infrastructure than what Labour planned is wrong. The Chancellor has refused to come to the house and put that straight. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility that the Government  the Government is spending 8 less compared to the plans they inherited from the last Labour  They're cutting too far and too fast. I'm happy to take an intervention. I would like to hear why the Government is spending 8 less.Their administration  Do they not feel they should have insisted there was proper investment in in that project to benefit the local area? I let the honourable lady have a second chance at intervening. But she didn't explain why in the first year of this Parliament the Government spent ï¿½3.2 billion less and in the sec year the Government 9 billion less and in the third year they inherited ï¿½6.7  When the Chancellor says he matched the plans of the last Labour Government he is just plain  I will give way. I wish her impending delivery very well. Can I ask what figure the front bench would place on what the capital expenditure budget for this year would be at this time under Labour stkph --? The plans set out by the last Labour government was 48.4  The plan by this government is 41.7. We have a plan to half the deficit during the course of this Parliament. This Government wanted to go further and eliminate the structural deficit. The reality is the Government is borrowing more than the plans left. They're borrowing not to invest in infrastructure, but they're spending ï¿½12n't 8 less. They are spending more on social security, because there are more people out of work and more people claiming  because of the failure of the Government to get the economy growing again. Is that ta what this Government came into power to do? No, but the reality is their decision to cut as far and as fast has choked the economy. The  this Government, are lethargic in the face of a flat- lining economy and they came in and they abandoned Labour projects, like the plans for 715 schools in a tranche of ideological cuts. They announced a new school building programme in 2012. But progress is painfully slow, with work only planned to start some time in the  More delay. It is simply not good enough.

If the Liberal Democrats want to intervene I would love to matter  If he does vice-president the guts to intervene, that -- doesn't have the guts to intervene, that is his problem not mine. Is there an intervention from the Liberal  I'm grateful for the the honourable lady for giving way.

I'm not sure what school or hospital or children's centre he would have preferred not to have opened, but I bet there are more opened under the -- under the last Labour Government than under this Conservative and Liberal Democrat Government. The reality is what the Government are doing is hurting business  The Director General of the British chambers of commerce has described the Government's plan for infrastructure as hot air, a complete fiction. I will give way. If he could explain why even the Director General of British Chambers of Commerce thinks the Government's plans are hot air. I wondered if under PFI, which she mentioned her mortgage. What would happen if she wasn't able to make repayments on her mortgage? I hope the honourable gentleman is not suggesting that the Government aren't going to be able to make payments on their debt. We know their triple-A rating is under  If this is a warning they not planning to pay their debts  would be interesting  The CBI has warned the Government that businesses in Britain are looking for action and we haven't seen it yet. Yesterday, the monthly index published by BDO showed business confidence has hit a 21-year low. That is the lowest level of business confidence since Norman Lamont was Chancellor and sterling was ejected from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on black Wednesday in 1992. Aim sure that members on the other side of the House will remember that day. The Prime Minister certainly does. He was working for the Chancellor at the time and confidence is now at those low levels again. It is now clear business have lost confidence in this Government that does not have a plan for jobs or growth. So it is hardly surprising that the Government is failing to attract the priert sector funds they need for their infrastructure investment. -- private sector. It is worth remembering thousand plan to target ï¿½20 million of pension funds is  Responding to a question from my honourable friend the member for south Perthshire, the Chief Secretary told us that the Government were on course for just one tenth of their original target. Two out of ï¿½20 billion raised. And the Government lacks the policy framework to attract the long-term investment we need. Changes such as the cuts to feeding tariffs have had a detrimental impact on low carbon investment. The CBI warned the Government such measures were damaging to business confidence with implication not just for immediate investment, but for longer term trust in Government  It is no wonder that last year 50 companies, investors and industry bodies wrote to the Chancellor asking him to set firm decarbonisation target. On any policy the institution of engineer and technology has been clear. They said short-term uncertainty around UK policy is unhelpful and has the potential to result in a delay in investment in all forms of energy infrastructure. In a poll by KPMG two thirds of businesses believe the UK's infrastructure is unlikely to get any better, because of uncertainty about the policy  From the business community there is a us fromration -- frustration at the policy. The Government does not understand that businesses long for certainty when attempting to gro. These are the people that we need to encourage,  And infrastructure is vital to that. This Government's ideological decision to cut infrastructure investment further and faster is Hampering confidence, rather than nurturing it. As small businesses are the engines of growth are still waiting for universal broadband. The Government abandoned the commitment to ensure broadband by 2012, when business needs this Government, they're nowhere to be found. Fundamentally, this Government fails to understand the need for a comprehensive and long-term plan to build Britain's infrastructure for the 21st Century. That is why the Labour Party has commissioned John Armit to consider how long-term infrastructure decision-make and finance can be  The Olympics taught us what we could achieve together as one nation.

In the years prior to the financial crisis, the previous government ran a structural deficit that was the biggest in the G7.

And will be congratulate the last government on computer reverse new high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel some 15 years after the Channel Tunnel was opened, and for starting the Crosswell scheme which is essential to the village of London? How can he repudiate that record of achievement? This was a good example of where there was cross- party support. The idea that there was some unilateral initiative of the Labour Party is ridiculous. We should have been more ambitious and gone further and faster. It will be 15 years before we can count on this first trains running on high- speed rail. I will give way. Perhaps we can answer the minister's question. It was the investment that the previous government was put into the West Coast main line that was swallowing up money that could otherwise have  But can I also say to him - and he is right about investment in schools and hospitals - that I would like to share with the House what the previous government idea was for funding capital projects.

As an LSE report published recently says, "interest that has been neglected, particularly in the areas of transport and energy. -- infrastructure. Ofgem has warned of power shortages by 2015". This the reflection of 13 years of neglect of Britain's in the stretch of the stock I find a bit of common ground with the Minister.

We need to invest more in infrastructure and to quote a member of the Institute of Public Policy Research, the cut was a decision of the last Labour government which the Coalition developed and inherited. It was Roger investment does not begin with the allocation of budget but with clear-sighted strategic decision-making. Many give two examples of the way Labour failed to us address -- address the strategic need for development of infrastructure. When Labour were first elected, John Prescott was appointed Secretary of State and took charge over transport. One of his first actions was to cancel almost all of the approved Prius schemes across the country. The reason was not that they did have not enough cash, because I'm pleased to say we left to the economy in rude health, but the road schemes were cancelled, along with many others, because John Prescott had fallen under the spell of the doctrine that said that if you build more roads, you will only attract more traffic. Corby is the most difficult place in the country for young person to find work. Youth unemployment has rocketed.

Let me address the point of strategic leadership. How can you have long-term leadership and vision to the future, when you cancel important economic contributions to success like road schemes? For years, this lunacy  It was recounted by the then Deputy Prime Minister and then we decided that more traffic required more and better roads.

And, for that  their stewardship of British Energy. In July 2009, after 12 years in office, the then government announced that it expected to have to resort to power cuts during the years ahead. They even published a chart in their strategy for Energy predicting an annual shortfall of 3,000 megawatt hours by 2017 - a truly shameful and damaging admission for a developed nation after 12 years of a government in power.

The eight biggest English cities outside London. I'm currently hearing expressions of interest from 20 more cities, from Plymouth to Sunderland, from Preston to Portsmouth. I give way. I'm very grateful for his generosity in giving way. May I ask on the city deals with the cities invested get a share of the economic added value, is that something he might consider or the Government might consider for Wales, so investment in the economic development we can get a share back and reinvest?Well, Mr Speaker, there is a Government in the Welsh Assembly that is led by his party. I commend the example that we've put forward in this country, the close-working we've made with each of the leaders of the eight cities, it has achieved very encouraging results to date. And it is something that I dare say he can go back to Wales and commend to his colleagues there. The way it can be financed has been transformed for the better. Labour sadled generations with PFI debts of ï¿½279 billion of which less than ï¿½40 billion has been paid off and which cost at least five times an often more than the original project costs of the investment. Our programme of infrastructure guarantees has made available ï¿½40 billion to underpin important projects of which ï¿½10 billion of investments have already been pre-- qualified only months after the initiative was begun. This will unlock vital investment such as the billion pound extension to the northern flien Battersea. On energy policy our reforms are driving investment in new capacity not only in generation but also in energy efficiency and extraction. Our energy industry is alive again. A new start after years of neglect under the party opposite. Mr Deputy  all governments are stewards of the country that elects  The test of their stewardship is whether they lead their country, better-equipped and better-prepared to pro-prosper in the future, through having taken the long-term decisions on which major infrastructure depends. In two  Britain's reputation for infrastructure has been transformed. Having plummeted down the league table of international countries rated by their performance in infrastructure, we are now climbing that table again. The rest of the world has seen that this country is shaking off the past. After more than a decade of inactions we are once more laying the foundations of  There isThere is an eight minute limit on speeches. Mr Geraint Davies? Mr Deputy There is a technicality, before we do. The question is: as on the order paper since when an amendment has been proposed, as is on the order  Mr Geraint Davies. Eight  Mr Deputy Speaker what a rag bag of complacency and distorted history comes to mind. I think all of us will remember, surely that pre-1997 we had a Government with massive unemployment, repossessions, companies going bust, people dying waiting for operations. And the reason for that was simply people weren't working, they weren't  debt was going up, tax was going up and public services were being cut. And from 1997 to 2008 we saw an unprecedented period of economic growth, thanks to a Labour Government getting people  so people were paying tax and this money was reinvested in jobs again and public services. In 2008 the sub-prime debt tsunami hit our shores we all know that. If it wasn't for Mr Bam Bam and Mr Brown who Mr Obama and Mr Brown who envoked fiscal stimulus we would have went noon a world oppression rather than mild stimulation which ended in 2010 with fragile groth inherited by this Coalition  -- fragile growth. They wasted that opportunity by immediately announcing 500,000 people would be sacked in the public services. They didn't say when or who, so people stopped spending money. Consumer demand went to the floor and since then growth has stagnated. The result is tax revenues has fallen, debt has  more people on the dole. We hear these figures about there is more people in jobs but how is it there is more people in jobs, than there is no more production? Simple answer: people who used to be in full-time jobs have now got two part-time jobs. It is a complete  The amount of infrastructure  of course has been cut in the first few years. There are proposals that there is more infrastructure investment. I want to see more infrastructure investment but obviously the proof of the pud something in the eating.  I'll believe it, when  -- proof of the pudding. In terms of my own location I mention a couple of very quick  Mr Deputy Speaker. I have already mentioned it is my firm contention that Wales gets its fair share of HS 2, 1.9 billion. I welcome the electrification to swan  I'm also interested in city regions and more investment there. I welcome those thoughts. There is more investment immediateed in South Wales M4 in terms of Newport and Port Talbot to speed-up business and commuter and tourist  To spark more investment. I would like to see the Government and the two treshries promised me an evaluation, on the tolls, if the Government paid for them whether it would recover the money for more income tax and will heer benefits because of increased jobs. That simply is a tax on trade between Wales and England. Moving swiftly  my intervention to my right honourable friend mentioned looking further afield to the emerging economies that are growing at enormous rates. I appreciate we don't have the Chinese political  the commitment of focus in investment in research and development is something that we could look at closely, as indeed they have in Brazil, which obviously is a democracy where they are investing ï¿½5.3 billion, for example in renewable energy and biotech and they are becoming world leaders there. In China, again, their investment means that they are actually taking out certain  in the United States in  that used to be leaders in solar power. We need to think strategically how to invest both in the infrastructure, but alongside  the inoccasion agenda is extremely important. Again, I would make no apology from coming back to Swansea where the European Investment Bank, which again is a fin example of, you know, a stredgeic investment, is investing -- strategic investment is investing to enable an overall  There is ï¿½250 million. That university has linked up with industrial partnerships in modern manufacturing and pre-technology and biotech which are touching edge, new exportable technologies, which interestingly, are the very areas, Brazil and China are looking  I think it is not just a matter of spades in the ground and roads and railways and I welcome roads and railways and indeed flood defences and this sort  But it is also about making rational choices of making rational choices of Will local authority would provide the land and then they would have the private money for building  but half of those would be social houses, the other half would be private houses. The public sector would end up with an income stream from the private houses and or half the overall equity and this supported by pension funds for long-term rented opportunities. So, there are opportunities for looking for investment outside and indeed, enormous opportunities for capital investment from abroad, from countries with surpluses, be it from or a lottery, with people like Quatre looking to enter -- invest in infrastructure so that,  when the oil runs out they will have income streams, and this is what we should be looking  rather than thinking, we cannot  We need to invest to increase trajectory of economic  And of course things like  it is very sad, but the preparatory work that has been done by the previous government for schools to the future wars -, and we are looking again at that, and investing in hospitals are, and keeping workers in work, and keeping people in good housing conditions is a good investment as  The key to this is the  so that you can look at the possibility of going down the high-speed route from London to Surrey Swansea and being there on the Internet, outside the  and I think that he is the strategic group we need to take, were by the very need to... I will allow it my colleague to speak. I profoundly disagree with the motion, especially when it talks about differing and the LEA,. I would call but caution and sensible  I want a considered approach to planning as well as kick-starting the economy. I think we should be really careful that we get the infrastructure right and not just move forward and building any old police. I am concerned that we have a cohesive approach to this and not a mad dash for growth without considering both communities and the way that we need to do it. I am concerned that we are entwining here, the planning and the Treasury. I what to make sure that you're giving due consideration that you are not, that to get the infrastructure  and we get it in the right  I want it to be associated with economic benefits, local regeneration and jobs, but never losing sight of the environment. These two are linked. We do not want to just joined the ranks of a badly implemented commissions which I will go on to later. Without the joined-up approach, to get the infrastructure in the right place with large privately funded proposals such as rail interchanges, you can have a developer-led scramble to see who gets their project through first, often not on the best site for the local area or national economic growth. Other sites may be more suitable as investors hold Byron case another rival site gets permission through the planning system. I want to make sure we're looking at this to think where do we need to deliver that infrastructure in Britain? It is obvious that large infrastructure projects can create jobs whilst doing the norm harm to their  So, taking the example from my constituency, according to the developer of the site, it will create over 3,000 jobs, the vast majority of which would be blue- collar jobs. This could be a considerable boost for a struggling  if the work force is  It would be a short in the arm for an area that needs of those  We have an unemployment rate 5%. 1155 people, the vast majority of them white collar  and we have a deficit of blue-collar workers.

This is a site now in the central bet for should development plan which will make the planning process simpler and hopefully  and it has a near by Luton airport looking for expansion. It has accessibility to roads and road freight. From an economic point of view it is in near Luton where latest figures show there are 6% unemployed, most of them blue- collar workers. I would like to marry up those two coincidences, but I am concerned that the prevailing mood driven by the opposition is that you must have permission to build in the name of economic necessity. If she would like to join me in agreeing, Mr  with the honourable lady like to clarify? That we should have the correct infrastructure in the correct place? She says that we  which is why I would like to qualify again... Of course Infrastructure and investments should be in the right place. There is no risk of any infrastructure under this Government. This is the problem that we have been trying to highlight today. The honourable lady seems to welcome that. The planning commission, much against the opposition of local residents who are on the green belt saw this granted on the grounds that the Strategic Rail Authority said we should have won just about there. The Government previously did nothing about it. I do not see why we should not have a strict rule that infrastructure must be placed exactly where it is needed and not where developers happen to choose to want it to happen, which then can be a Trojan horse to a business development park because they never got the rail links they promised. This is not what we should be doing with infrastructure. It should be in the right place and linked to the right workforce. If we're going to allow development of no -- much- needed housing we should look at why we have 142,000 planning permissions that have been granted but not implemented. Across England, this goes up to 400,000. We should look at what was granted and question why it was not built in the first place, according to the planning permission that was granted to it. Future generations will judge us, whether we had the stewardship of the countryside, if we're not making sure that infrastructure is correctly located. We should examine large-scale infrastructure developments and large-scale housing developments that have not come to fruition and make sure that we do not just speed up the planning process, when  we are not helping the  making sure the development happens where there is economic need and people are taking opportunities.

Can I thank my Honourable Friend for bringing forward this debate on what is an incredibly important issue? I disagree with the honourable member for St Albans when she says we need to move forward slowly to build infrastructure. Given to people that are desperately looking for  we need a great deal of urgency from this Government, particularly given its appalling record in the last 2.5 years.

I agree with the CBI and many others including economists who had previously endorsed this Government's plans who said this Government lacks the political will to take forward major infrastructure projects. When you get on that train at St Pancras that the last government did so much to make possible, you can now come to Corby, to the new railway station be built at Corby, and tell anyone of the commuters or people use it for leisure that the last Labour government did not do enough to put real constituencies -- will services in my constituency and they will laugh you out of town on the last train.

We need it make it as easy to do business -- to make it as easy to do business with  with New York and with vital emerging markets from our regional cities, as it is from the City of London. Mr Speaker, Labour left a rail system that was rapidly approaching capacity. Network Rail forecasted that the West Coast Main Line would be completely full by 2004. InterCity rail network could not cope without the additional capacity that would be provided by  I'm proud that this Government is taking the bold steps necessary to take that scheme forward.  looking at will he Kateing in Halesowen and Rowly Reedge is know they'll have connecting services from the three mainline stations in my constituency to the HS2 terminal in  offering fast routes to London and later to Manchester, Leeds Edinburgh and Glasgow. If I could make run representation to my right honourable friend on the Government front bench it would be for this investment in bringing our cities together to be complicated by a new focus on the importance of our regional airports. Now whatever the rights and wrongs on the debate of expanding Heathrow, there could be no doubting the benefits of making better use of existing and potential capacity at airports outside of London. Building a second runway, for  at Birmingham airport would increase spare capacity to 50 million passengers, per year, creating or sustaining 50,000 jobs. Transforming Birmingham, Manchester and other regional airports into additional hub airports, would transform our regional economies, as well as releaving some of the pressure from Heathrow. -- releaving. ! When it comes to increasing the turnover in the activity of regional airports, does he feel that should also happen in the regions of say Scotland and Northern Ireland where I represent and specifically Aldergrove airport, Belfast City and London Derry  which can then increase the economy across the whole of the  I think the honourable gentleman makes a very good point. I think we need to be encouraging greater use for capacity for all  As part of this vital effort to rebalance the British economy in the way that I have described. And transport infrastructure is not only vital to business, it is also essential for people's everyday  The previous Government, as the right honourable friend, the Minster said, the previous Government explicitly set out to price people out of their cars to reduce demand for investment in road infrastructure. Instead we need to see how we can make our roads better. My constituents were pleased that the Government is investing more in local roads through the highways maintenance block grant to councils. Unfortunately Labour's record in local Government highlights the hypocrisy of the Opposition's motion today. People in Dudleyborough have benefited from ï¿½2 million investment in local road  Unfortunately the new Labour administration is cutting the road maintenance budget by the  pound-for-pund, as the additional funding from the Department of Transport. -- pound-  Labour in local  have shown time and  as far as they are concerned, infrastructure funding is a slow priority but residents know you cannot build a strong local economy with third-rate infrastructure. I wonder whether the honourable gentleman understands that some of the cuts that local government are delivering may well be the result of the 50% cash reduction that most of them are experiencing over the I am giving an example of a specific decision about priorities for local funding. I welcome this Government's commitment to efficient investment in vital infrastructure at a time when finances are constrained by the need to tackle the record deficit built up by their predecessors. Using government guarantees that to leverage private investment is a prudent use of public funds, but over used as has been described in the debate so far come of the PFI scheme has left taxpayers paying over the odds for capital schemes.  the Chancellor's announcement of the new PF2 scheme in the Autumn Statement was badly needed. We must restore confidence that public money allocated for infrastructure is being spent on roads, schools and hospitals rather than swelling the pockets of contractors. My constituents are particularly pleased that proposals for a new Midland Metropolitan Hospital were cited as the first candidate for the new scheme within the NHS. I know that local hospitals, the local hospital's trust, has been working hard with the Department of Health and the Treasury to make sure that those plans progress, and I hope that my constituents can look forward to further good news,  Such investment would not only undoubtedly stimulate local economic activity in the short term, it would provide a valuable new facility providing better services, more efficiently, for years to come.  I believe that the Government has taken the necessary and tough decisions to invest for the long-term in Britain's infrastructure to make up for the gap and the deficit which was left by the previous government. Thank  Mr Speaker, can I draw my attention to my interest as the clear and the register? This has been a curious debate. Infrastructure is, at least in  a subject on which there is a large measure of core -- cross- party support. There is general agreement across the House that we do need to ensure we have the transport network, the power arrangements, the waste and water distribution systems, the sewerage  the club protection  all the necessary infrastructure that is essential to  functioning economy -- flood protection. We should have been debating how we make the reality of the investment programmes to deliver the kind of infrastructure that is essential to economic well-being in the longer  and the short term, will help to create jobs and employment and give growth to the stuttering  But we did not. We have seen instead differences not just across the House between the minister and my honourable friend from our front bench, but also from the minister and his backbench  the minister -- Member for St Albans, who took a very different view Deal and rather than echoing his stated wish that Infrastructure Investment should be speeded up, she was making a passionate case that it should be  He received from my speech I am talking about the strategic rail freight enter change in my constituency but more to the point I think he would agree that it causes tensions within communities when it is about waste disposal and these things have to be weighed up and balanced, harm to the environment against development. When she reads Hansard tomorrow she will see clear references to going slow and not following the advice of the front bench colleague you wanted to accelerate development. He has not been very successful in  but at least his heart was in the right place! I am with him on that. Maybe, to divert attention away from the difficulties he has with his own party who do not share his enthusiasm for speeding up infrastructure investment, he chose to present a case that was frankly, absurdly partisan and the implication that there was no worthwhile infrastructure investments during the period of the previous government, and that their rut -- the arrival of the current government has unleashed a cornucopia of new schemes, is,  risible. Let us look at  It was completely unfair of him to say that there had been no worthwhile investment in  Let us look at the history of high-speed one. The link between the Channel Tunnel and London. It was not built at the time of the Channel Tunnel, because the government headed by Baroness Thatcher did not believe in rail  The French did. There was a high-speed link from that tunnel to Paris, and the Belgians  there was a link from the tunnel to Brussels but there was no link to London because the Conservative government did not believe in it, and eventually, the Labour government -- the John Major government had a last-minute change of heart and began to recognise the  but it could not get it  so this scheme was left in financial uncertainty when the Labour Government came into power.  I hope, because he is a fair-minded man, will recognise that the achievement of high speed one was the achievement of the last Labour government. Secondly I would remind him about CrossRail. It is a scheme that has been talk about from a very long time ago, the mists of antiquity, but it was the Labour government that got to the point of introducing a Bill to enable across real scheme to be  But rather characteristically of them, their political management was so Opera, they entrusted it to a hybrid Bill committee that rejected it, so that they will never progress, the infrastructure was not built, and once again it was left to the Labour government to introduce the scheme and take the Bill through Parliament and begin work. I give credit to the present government which has sustained investment in across real scheme and I am glad they Cup but, frankly, it is  the argument that everything that is being done today is wonderful at nothing is wonderful that was done previously, because CrossRail was a scheme that was developed by the previous  being carried forward a by the current government and it depends on that bd of cross-party consensus to make a reality of long-term investment schemes like The on the role we Gentleman will recall that I make no criticism -- Honourable Gentleman  I said these decisions are for the long term and in particular, the proposals he mentioned enjoy cross-party support. The criticism I made of the previous government was that the decision of the Minister for whom  Lord Prescott, to cancel 103 out of 140 road schemes, so when the spirit of bipartisanship, will he now reflect on that and accept that it was the wrong thing to do? Perhaps he will reflect on the point made by the Member for Corby about the role of Lord Prescott indication of high-speed  and that praise given to him by the Rt Hon Michael Heseltine. I am sure he would accept that he was  I have given way twice, so I cannot give way again, I hope he will bear with me. I want to taken to task once more. We have a new item and that is over the national infrastructure plan. His speech and indeed the motion put forward by the Government, the  it is based on this absurd proposition that the national infrastructure plan is entirely the project of the present  He will know very well that infrastructure UK was set up by the previous government. All the preparatory work on the national infrastructure plan was done under that government, which is why his government was able to publish the national infrastructure plan in  If he thinks about it, it will be impossible to put together that national infrastructure plan and publish it within three to four months of his party coming into government. It was by partisan and I hope, Mr  that we can continue this debate in a more mature spirit and recognise that cross-party agreement is essential if we are to get real infrastructure investment that we need, and to get it done  without the kind of problems we encounter too often in  as a result of the feelings of governments of all complexions. One of the other things I would like to focus on is the ambivalence we have about  Firstly, ambivalence about whether it is infrastructure. The national infrastructure plan does not define it as such, but the Government in its infrastructure Financial Assistance Act does make provision for ï¿½10 billion worth of support for investment to go to housing schemes. I would be very interested to hear the minister's view as to whether infrastructure should be defined so as to embrace  and if so, how quickly he thinks housing might benefit from  because last summer, the minister responsible talk about ï¿½40 billion worth of schemes that were shovel-ready, all ready to go, and he talked about him going in the  We are now well past the  and to the best of my  not a single housing scheme has been given the go ahead, and we have only got to the point of defining this criteria by which schemes might be assessed, so this does not look like speedy progress. I would welcome some clarity from the minister about when you would expect that financial support mechanism to have any impact in the housing field, where we are facing a terrible problem or on the supply. I personally believe that it is impossible -- under supply. You need housing, just as much as you need the other things essential for economic development so I would include within the infrastructure development plan, provision for  In the last tour of months, 000 housing starts were  I put it to the minister, who was critical of the failure of the previous government in this respect, if he goes back to 2007, before the recession hit, we started 185,000  If his government gets anywhere near the level of output of the previous government, they will be doing very well. They need to go very much further and faster than they have and I hope they will think about how this scheme will simulate housing development. The one other area by the touch on his  The minister was interestingly coy about that. We are reminded constantly, not least by the Mayor of London, who is the same party as the honourable  that there is a chronic problem of under capacity for aviation in London and the South  and there is an urgent need for new investment. There will be differences about where we believe that increase in capacity should be  I personally believe the Thames estuary is a right location. I am with the Mayor of London on  Other people believe Heathrow Airport should be expanded, others believe Stansted airport is the right location, but nobody believes we do not need to expand capacity. And the Government has kicked it into touch until after the next general election. That is not an adequate response. I put it to the minister that the Government will have to be more serious and should approach this on a cross-party  if we're to get progress on Infrastructure Investment, which is  It is necessary to reduce the time limit on back bench speeches to six minutes. Apologies but it has to be done. Given the new time limits and the scope of the Government's activities in the infrastructure of build, I am tempted to limit my remarks to the  The second most absurd comic in his speech after the one with reference to the Thames estuary Airport was the one where he invited the minister to recognise that HS one was the achievement of the last Labour  I thought he was going to see that infrastructure was a long-term thing and that both parties had been involved. But it was even more striking, the Member for Corby said we had Lord Prescott to thank for the preservation of the wander off Prasad of St Pancras  which might be news to the late Sir John Betjeman. The Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act was passed in  including outline planning  and the then government decided as part of that to have the station at en suite, and that sinister element in North Kent that has flowed from that. HS one cuts through my constituency. There was significant opposition at the time  to a degree, the community has settled with that and the noise and interference from those trains is not as great as I fear that might  But, we have had significant benefit from having its fleet. The Honourable Gentleman should recognise that cross-party impotence that was behind HS1. --  We heard speakers a saying there was projects in Brazil, worth some 5 billion, that was mentioned,  the scope and scale and ambition of this, the vision of the Chancellor from his time in opposition until now, driving this  despite the state of the public finances we were left, is usually impressive.

Particular credit is due, given the financial circumstances in which we have driven this forward. I look forward if the honourable member will allow me this courtesy of visiting his constituency on 27th February seeing the handover of the station to CrossRail. Barclay Homes and Developments has done a great job and it'll be a great benefit to his  I think there will be huge benefits to North Kent from  with the connections through the Dartford and the Medway  and they'll be much-improved and hugely to be welcomed. The final thing I want to say relates to CrossRail but I think the prospect of a spur from Stratford to stand stead I think would be something which I think could be a tribute and legacy to this  -- to Stansted. We are looking for infrastructure projects which can be taken forward quickly. We have the Davis review to report  but it has an interim report of 2013 which is meant tolike at how we get better use of existing runway capacity in the  The single answer has to be Stansted it. Has one runway only half used at the moment. The reason it doesn't, is because it doesn't have the good links to central London. If we had that CrossRail spur it, would do. The ex-aviation minister, Steve Norris is doing fantastic work in promoting this. What he is press something to have a six-mile tunnel from Stratford through to Fairlop Waters and have the rail run along the M11 to Stansted, that would be 23 minutes from Stansted to Liverpool Street, half an hour to the West End or Ebbsfleet. What a legacy for this Government in terms of stick starting the construction  what better should we do? We should have support from our Liberal Democrats with that. They don't want any new runways ever in the South East but at lest they believe in improved transport connections and are working with Conservatives to deliver that in this Government. I would ask Treasury ministers if they would allow the opportunity for Steve Norris the ex-aviation minister and perhaps myself and the honourable friend for Richmond Park to speak to them to put this case but it could be a solution, at least in the near-term and possibly in the longer-term for the aviation  He is making a powerful argument for the joined up thinking I was trying to stress. I hopes he continues with it, the more we can get areas that want development, married up with good benefits, the better for all concerned. I think Stansted and CrossRail spur could  not just from a local perspective but a regional and national infrastructure.

In this area, the more we can work to get both the economy moving through the investment infrastructure where the communities want and it where the nation wants it, the better. I would ask the minister to take that agenda forward and, in particular, can he give a further boost to the economy by looking at further extension of CrossRail and srously have the Treasury as well as the Department for Transport look at that case that's being made for a rail CrossRail spur from Stratford through to Stansted. Thank you Mr Speaker. Can I start by congratulating my friend the honourable member for Leeds West for securing this debate on such a vital and important issue. I would like to draw the attention of the  if I may to the Croydon tram  or rather the lack of it. This is a project with huge support  supported by the Mayor of  during his re-election  He came it the area twice and was photographed where the tram route was supposed to do, supporting it and I regret very much that the scheme is now not being proposed for delivery.

I am aprivileged as a member of this House to be a member of the Public Administration Select Committee which is currently conducting an inquiry into Government procurement. In evidence given to that Select Committee, we have repeatedly been told that the lack of a long-term Government procurement pipeline for national infrastructure, means that businesses are not confident and cannot plan for growth and jobs and therefore they do not invest. What we therefore see as a result of  of what the Government is  is he yes, more jobs, low- paid and part-time but no growth. When you see more jobs, but no  what you are looking at is aical apps in productivity. The confidence of business has been broken by the failure of the Government to invest.

Can I commend my honourable friend from Croydon North's comments about the unwillingness of business to invest and the effect that has on jobs and growth itself because of their lack of confidence in the economic prospects of the country, caused by this Government's economic policy. I thought that point summarised the problems and why this debate is so crucial and why it is so crucial that the Government gets it right when it comes to infrastructure investment. Because when the coalition Government was elected one of its first acts was to cancel a number of infrastructure projerbgts including building schools for the future programme. Chesterfield high school in my constituency was one of the victims of that decision, and as a result did not receive the investment in new buildings so  The decision also meant the end of plans for Chesterfield high school to be integrated with Crosby high school. It is a special school and students at both schools and staff would have benefited from the integration of special and main-stream education on the same  Sadly this was not to be. Honourable members across the country have examples of similar impacts of the cancellation of building schools for the future. The Government scrapped a number of infrastructure schemes when it took  The Government also reviewed a number of schemes which the last Government had already approved. When looking at the lovely of infrastructure spending, it is clear this the Government has cut the level of investment by ï¿½12.8  compared to the plans of the previous Government.

There has been a Marked absence of opposition to  partly as a result of consultation carried out by Sefton  yet the Secretary of State decided the call in the project and hold a public inquiry. At the cost of the inquiry the Government has delayed a much-needed piece of infrastructure and here we are, three years later no, sign of building work. I'm sure colleagues will know the such of such inquiries and the final cost of the road will be of great interest to my constituents and I dare say that members on all sides will know of schemes that have had similar delays because of the way that we do infrastructure in this country. The example of the Thornton relief  the slow progress made there and the complete lack of progress on most of the projects on the infrastructure pipeline, in the Treasury's own words, not mine, describe an institutional delay that happens in this country. And a real problem that we have with infrastructure. And, for those members who have talked about  that is an issue that certainly needs to be addressed across the House. But the lack of  the delay in starting work and the decline in the construction industry show a much bigger problem which lies at the heart of the economic problems in this country. The Thornton Relief Road is important to the economic benefits it'll bring once it's built but is also vitally important because of the impact on construction on the local economy, on the jobs it'll bring n and on the multiplyer effect of infrastructure spending on wider  This lack of activity is a key reason why our economy has stalled since May 2010 and the fact that the construction sector has declined so much is a cause for very great long-term concerns as well as for the short-term impact that it has had. Output in the construction industry fell by 9.3% between the end of 2011 and the end of 2012 and 129,000 jobs have been lost in construction since the Tories and Lib Dems joined forces The company's closed at cannot just  workers cannot simply be re-employed. And the potential economic is not realised when it is  and that is now. The Government wants to speed up the planning process to help economic development but also expensive planning inquiries that delayed the start of projects. You might think that the country had been turned into one big building site. How far from the truth can that be? The description of large white school projects might lead you to believe we had a thriving, growing economy with the construction sector  but sadly this is not the  The government figures show what is really happening.

In my constituency, I can think immediately of a new bypass, new further-education college, New  several GP surgeries, several new schools, and thousands of people who benefited from the decent homes programme under the last Labour government. And I am very concerned that this Government is not investing in the North East, as it should be. In the Autumn Statement 2011, of the ï¿½40 billion which the Chancellor switched into capital spending, or only 0.03 % came to the north-east. In the Autumn Statement of 2012, there was an injection of ï¿½124 million, a road-widening scheme in Gateshead and some housing. This takes our share of the Government's capital spend to an incredible 0.5%. This is an appalling waste of opportunity and potential in the  I am sorry that the minister who began the debate is not in his place. I would ask the Treasury to look at the report from the IPPR about the way that cost- benefit analyses are done on roads, which makes it very clear that there is not a level playing field between they were the cost-benefit analysis is done in areas of  and areas which are densely populated and I would hope the Treasury would revisit that. I would also hope they would look at the report from the north-east Chambers of Commerce which make it very clear that we have a large number of projects that would make a significant improvement in the operation of the North-East economy. And that is important, because what we are faced with now is the highest unemployment in the country, 1%. That is the short-term problem the Government has pushed  The long-term problem, as set out by Oxford economics, who we had doing some special simulations, show that in 10 years' time, as compared with 2010, there will be a 000 jobs deficit in the region. 000 people's lives wasted, because this government is not making intelligent decisions about  The infrastructure decisions the Government is taking are driven almost entirely by political considerations rather than economic considerations.

Neither of them are doing it effectively. By breaking up the large areas on which we were letting out contracts on broadband, and going down that route of fragmentation by local authority areas, what the Government did was make it uneconomic for many producers to bid for the contract.

I am grateful to talk about infrastructure in the City of London. The capital is about to hit a demographic timebomb that seems to have taken the Government and City all by surprise.

My My honourable friend makes a very important point there. What the spending in Scot stkhrand, was actually enabled the Scottish Government -- in Scotland did, was actually enabled the Scottish Government to announce that unemployment was not rising as fast in Scotland as it was in the UK and they were taking a great deal of pleasure at this stage to be able  Sadly that hasn't been maintained. It hasn't been maintained and we're hearing of how less the Scottish Government is at dealing with unemployment. At present the opposite is happening. I would argue one of the reasons why that is happening is that that investment in infrastructure, and in particular in housing, has not been sustained. The figures are  The starts in 2010s with  In 2011 it fell to 6,460.  the fall is to 3,405.

One is that they could actually use the tax-raising powers which were given in 1999 as part of devolution. They haven't chosen to use those. I think people in Scotland would be prepared to see them being used if they thought it could be invested in the way that has been done  They've also put such a stranglehold on local government by having a five-year council tax  which has naepbt local government cannot make the choice, -- which has meant that local government cannot make the choice to go out to its area to say, we desperately need more house, we could put up council tax to borrow and then build the much-needed  There are ways I would contend thrat Scottish Government could in fact continue with its -- contend that the Scottish Government could in fact continue showing that boosting infrastructure boosts economy and boosts employment. I would urge them to go back to doing that. Not perhaps simply to allow thoinges detier areaiate, so they can always  which I'm afraid they tend to do -- to allow things to deteriorate. The Government here is trying to  fascinating some of this discussion because if you had fallen asleep in 1997 and woken up to this debate you would have wondered which party was talking. We seem to be in a position where the Government benches want to argue the last Government didn't do anything in infrastructure and by  when they did do anything on infrastructure it was all this  Now, I seem to recall that PFI was not indeed a Labour Government invention, it was very much an enthusiastically put forward by the preceding Government to that and I'm interested to know where this conversion has happened. Now you can get that sort of investment better if you want but my city is a will the better for some of the public-private partnerships which we put in place, the schools that were built and the investment that has taken place. In 2007 in Scotland lot of things seem to happen in Scotland fist these days which are then followed, not always for the better here. -- in Scotland first. 2007 a Scottish Government of a nationalist persuasion took over the administration and in my city a Lib Dem-SNP council took over and both decided they didn't like these public-private partnerships, so they weren't going to do them. They were going to come up with a magic way of creating these investments. As a result not one new school started in the five years of that Lib Dem-SNP administration. Not one. Several were finished and they were very pleased to go and open them and have their name put on the opening plaque, but those were the schools that were planned and funded through public-private partnerships.  we seem to have undergone some miraculous conversion at some point. I'm in the quite sure when. But have not come up with anything which really works in its place. And I would simply, finally, call in support of this argument none other than the Mayor of London, who is quoted in tonight's Evening Standard calling for, "A ï¿½.3 billion investment in housing in London -- ï¿½1.3 billion." Perhaps the Government would like to listen to the Mayor of Its own political persuasion. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. This has been a good, thoughtful debate with members on both sides of the House illustrating just how important infrastructure projects are to their constituencies, to the wider region and to UK PLC as a  I wanted to highlight some of the more memorable moments. The honourable member for Swansea West summed up the response by the Government minister in his opening speech as "a dismal display of dither and delay." I hope I have paraphraseed him correctly. With the member for St Albans giving the Government position away, really, by speaking up for dither and delay and cautioning against a mad dash  Well you couldn't accuse the Government of that? More like a mad dash for the dip. But my honourable friend the member for Corby spoke my mind when he expressed deep concern about the Government's very backward looking approach on this issue. But, you  also gave a passionate plea for more infrastructure investment  My honourable friend the member for Greenwich and Woolwich spoke passionately about high speed 1, a major achievement by Labour in Government and also set out his concerns for the lack of housing investment by this  The honourable member for Rochester and strued kept his comments limited to rail infrastructure, he claiming because the Government's infrastructure activities are too broad and varied. I would argue it is the area that the Government only seems to be taking any action on at all. The honourable member for Croydon North raised a crucial issue of youth unemployment in his contribution, an issue which the complacent approach of the Government seems to overlook too often. And my honourable friend the member for Seftn central called the a cancellation, rashly made by the Government taking office, for the building schools for the future  which had a major impapbgt not just on children, but on economic growth. And 0.05% of Government investment to date is the north-east's share. And this Government's decisions being driven by political remember than economic  My honourable friend, the member for Tottenham set out the desperate need for investment in  And seconded by my honourable friend the member for Edinburgh East, who quoted the Mayor of London calling for much the same thing. And, the majority of members that I have commented upon are indeed on this side of the House because we have called this debate today to raise this issue of the fundamental role infrastructure projects could and should be play in getting our country and getting our economy on the road to recovery  An economy that has been flatlining, as a result of the Government's failing plan and an economy that did not grow at all in the whole of 2012. An economy that has now shrunk in four of the last five quarters. I give way. My honourable friend is talking about growth rates since the 2010  My understanding has been 0.4% growth rate in this country. Does she agree with me that particularly on the debate on infrastructure, the huge contrast between America and jrm any and other countries where they are maintaining their stimulus and they are above their pree-crisis peak and are grow -- their pree-crisis peek. -- pre-  My honourable friend makes the point well. We saw infrastructure investment fall off the cliff when this Government came into power and we're seeing the economic consequences of that today.  we've heard many members have referred to the Chancellor's 2010 Spending Review which took place in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the UK's economy has grown 4% since then.

The much-vaunted national infrastructure plan published in 2011 identified 40 priority projects that the Government stated were of national significance and critical for growth. Yet despite the Government's claim to focus on these so-called priority areas and a Cabinet committee that's supposed to be overseeing progress we are yet to see spades in the ground for too many of these projects. Last year's Autumn Statement announced a 5 infrastructure package but this is to be paid for by cuts to departmental spending and underspends, including capital underspends and one-third of the projects included in this package had been previously announced by the Government. Indeed, describing the 2011 infrastructure plan as "hot air a complete fiction", the Director-General of the British Chambers of Commerce urged the Government to develop bold leadership and creative ideas and to "get a grip on this issue in order to stimulate economic " The CBimt's assessment of the Government's performance doesn't get any better with its annual infrastructure survey lastier fining that 73% of its members don't think transport infrastructure will improve over the next five years and two-thirds believe the UK's energy and water infrastructure is unlikely to get any better and this has been damningly described by the CBI Director-General as a wake-up call that business in Britain are looking for action and we haven't  Even the Deputy Prime Minister finally appears to have woken up to the importance of this  although a little late in  when he acknowledged last month that the coalition cut capital spend toog deeply when they came into Government and -- spending too deeply. And while we were disappointed that the latest apology didn't come via YouTube, the I'm sorry infrastructure re-mix, we were offered this particular mea culpa by the House magazine who he  "I think we've all realised that you actually need, in order to foster a recovery to try to mobilise as much public and private capital into infrastructure as " Yes. That's what we have been saying on this side of the House all along. In fact in its first three years this Tory-led Government has spent ï¿½12.8 billion less in company tal investment when compared to the plans inherited  -- capital investment. A fall of 8%. According to the Government's own office for Budget responsibility. They'll spend less over the course of this Parliament than Labour's plans. It is not just about infrastructure.

Our motion calls for the Government to do just I have listened with great interest to the backbench contributions. This is clearly an issue about which many members feel strongly. It is also an issue both sides of the House seemed to agree on in  Both sides want to see the UK with a world-class infrastructure, and recognise the importance that improved infrastructure will have won the nation's economic future.

We have slashed the record budget deficit by a quarter. We have restored economic credibility and will bring Britain up for business. And that credibility has led to record low interest rates with a government's tenure funding costs half by 2010. This has been crucial to creating the economic environment in which this Government can invest in infrastructure and in which investors can feel their funds are  I wonder if the minister would like to explain to this House and indeed to the country why it is that the predictions made by the officer budget responsibility at the so called time of the emergency budget and cobwebs of spending review have not happened, growth has not happened, and the deficit has not been reduced at the rate the Government originally promised. I can direct the honourable lady to read the report by the Office for Budget Responsibility where they are just a number of reasons, not least the eurozone crisis and many other reasons. She might like to read the report. I would like to respond to the points raised by honourable members. I would like to start with accusations made from the benches opposite of that, if they won the election that they would have somehow miraculously invested more. The reality is, if they win the election they would have continued borrowing recklessly. That would have led to higher interest rates and probably lead this country into the hands of the IMF once again, which seems to be something of a speciality for them. Let's look at their March 2010  This shows the previous government was planning to cut capital spending by 6% compared to our latest plans. In nominal terms they were planning to cut capital spending by 22% between 2010-14. And my Honourable Friend, the member for North West Leicestershire raised their the point and the honourable lady  Let me read the words of the Rt Hon Member for South  He said in July 2010, "we were going to cut by 50% but she of the national income going into capital spending." that is the truth and they want to deny it.  this Government has overseen an increase in investment in infrastructure from ï¿½29 billion to ï¿½33 billion, and in the Autumn Statement the Chancellor unveiled 5 billion of investment including ï¿½1.5 billion for the strategic rail network. Members are aware that the vast majority of spending needs to come from the private sector. This is where we are taking measures to target and support investment like the UK guarantee scheme, providing up to ï¿½40 billion worth of support to critical infrastructure. I will  He told me in an answer on the guarantee scheme last month, that no project has been guaranteed under the UK guarantee scheme at  And yet in the Autumn  the Chancellor said, I can confirm a blown of ï¿½1 billion and the guarantee to extend the Northern Line to Battersea Power Station and support a new development on a similar scale for the Olympic Park. Does this not show the uncertainty and confusion at that hour of the infrastructure failures of this government, but who's right? Him or the Chancellor? I thank him for his intervention. He made a point which she was right to make about the action the Government has taken to implement this guarantee scheme. In terms of the ï¿½40 billion of guarantees  there is about ï¿½10 billion of guarantees that a pre-  not yet issued, and in terms of the Northern Line extension to Battersea, there has been a ï¿½1 billion guaranteed for that project. This is substantial  Since the Bill received Royal Assent in up over 2012. This is why we're working tirelessly to encourage further investment, not just from overseas, but also from pension funds.

So, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a government with a long-term strategy for infrastructure. The national infrastructure plan, the first time the Government has set out such a plan, again defies 550 projects with a value or of 0 ï¿½310  This Investment pipeline gives a certain taint to investors, either true advises projects through the creation of a top 40 list and utilises a dedicated Cabinet committee to ensure infrastructure of delivery. The opposition motion alleged to the John Marmot Review into long-term infrastructure, and I am sure that given the important role he played in the Olympics, it will be an interesting read, and I will look at his recommendations. I am sure that his advice will be very considered and balanced and politically neutral and they will be very surprised if it was influenced by the Shadow Chancellor,  Of course, we have also recently appointed our own Olympic expect to oversee a review of Whitehall's ability to deliver infrastructure in order to increase commercial expertise across  We are enhancing the mandate of infrastructure UK, increasing the capability of that organisation to make sure projects are delivered.
