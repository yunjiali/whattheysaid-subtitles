Hello and welcome to BBC Parliament's live coverage of the House of Commons. In an hour, George Osborne will answer an urgent question about the downgrading of the triple-A rating.  MPs will discuss the children and families Bill. Remember to join me this evening for a a full round-up of the day in both Houses of Parliament at 11pm. We have questions to Philip Hammond THE SPEAKER: Order. Questions to the Secretary of State for defence. Question number one, Mr Speaker. With permission, Mr Speaner, I should like to answers questions 1 and 15 together. The defence budget for the financial year 2015/16 will be set in the current spending round which is expected to conclude in the summer. The budget for subsequent years will be set in the first spending review. The MoD has agreement with -- an agreement with  From 2015/16 to 2020/21, our equipment plan is based on that assumption.  the Secretary of State boasted that he would balance the budget over ten years. To prove his  he said, "I have agreed with the National Audit Office that it will review the equipment plan and confirm that it is affordable." The National Audit Office in January however, their report says that it couldn't offer a definitive view on the affordability of that equipment plan. Will the Secretary of State tell us how we can believe a word that this Government says on the defence when its central claim can't be confirmed by the independent National Audit Office?  what the honourable lady needs to do is go away and read the National Audit Office report  She needs to read some previous National Audit Office reports on equipment plans. For  in the 2010 National Audit Office Report they discovered that in a single year under Labour, just two programmes Typhoon and The Queen Elizabeth Aircraft Carrier rose rose in costs. They said the budget remains unaffordable over the next ten years. Mr Speaker, we are happy with the National Audit Office review into the equipment  It recognised the huge steps of progress that we have made. It set out an affordability assessment model for the department's assumptions... THE SPEAKER: Order. Both the question and the answer are hopelessly long winded. We need to get better. The Prime Minister promised real terms growth in the post 2015  can the Secretary of State confirm that will be the case in terms of the equip equipment budget and the non-equipment budget?The Prime Minister has made it clear that he stands by his view that the equip equipment plan needs to increase in real terms and we have a pledge from the Treasury that we may plan on a 1% increase. I don't think that was what the Prime Minister said. But does my right honourable friend agree if we  we should continue to meet the NATO objective of spending at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product on defence? I agree with my right honourable friend and the plans we have set out show that we will continue to comply with that 2% thesh Hold. -- threshold. I wonder if the Secretary of State can enlighten the House on what discussions he had with the Treasury in light of the Prime Minister's announcement last week that some of the aid budget might very usefully be diverted to peacekeeping operations and for the department to have another another 65 billion extra, how will they spend it when the Ministry of Defence is short of cash? Well, I will leave it to the Secretary of State for International Development to explain how they are propose to go spend their budget. But I -- propose to go spend their budget. There is a high level of co co report ration between the Ministry of Defence and -- co-operation from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International  It makes sense at how we spend the budgets available to achieve the objectives of those departments and secure the UK's vital national interests.  Mr Speaker. In May last  the minister announced that he had balanced the MoD's books. He called in the National Audit Office to validate his assertion, but the awedors declared his costings are overoptimistic and his approach is not statistically valid. It said the costings are not sufficiently robust to support the affordability  Isn't it time for the Defence Secretary, and the Prime Minister to admit that he has has failed to deliver on his boasts when it came to the MoD budget? No, I am sorry the honourable lady for west Lancashire has stolen his  We have An equipment plan that includes �4.8 billion of contingency, �8 billion of con contingency within the individual protects and �8 billion of unallocated head room. His right honourable friend has said that since the election the MoD has made welcome progress particularly on the purchasing of equipment. Also saying that we had made great strides forward. This is in marked contrast to the National Audit Office and the PAC's assessment of what happened under the previous Government. He should spare us a lecture. This is the party that sold off the Harriers and couldn't decide which aeroplanes to cut in the carriers and cost the country country tens of millions of pounds. When the Defence Secretary told this house wa That the he was -- that the defence bulght was in defence budget was in balance. There was a 5 billion black hole in the plans and to quote, "Achieving affordability and savings has been achieved elsewhere in the budget.". His plans to boost the equipment will fall in armed cuts and armed cuts welfare. The figure he is quoting the �12 billion is an internal audit assurance service figure which quoted by the National Audit Office and that has subsequently been reassessed at �4.4 billion. The honourable gentleman is wrong. I said -- say to him this, Labour has to decide whether it is going to engage seriously in this debate or  Last year at the Labour Party  hed to his -- he told  the party must deal with  Two weeks ago he told The Daily Telegraph, "I am not going to say whether we are going to overturn this cut or another." Swi it to be -- which is it to be more duck? -- ducking? Given that the Green Paper makes clear that the TA units will be more frequently Hughes used, replacing regular troops by reservists is cost effective? We have allocated 8 billion over ten years for additional training, infrastructure and equipment for the reserve, trying to rebuild the broken trust as a result of the previous Government's slashing of funding for reserve training and equipment. In terms of the economics of using reserves versus regular forces, when deployed on operations, reserves more expensive than  but held as a contingency, reserves are lower cost than regular forces. We are simply trying within the budget envelope we have available to create the greatest amount of military capacity that is possible to generate.  Mr Speaker. Can the Secretary of State give any detail as to what the consequences are going to be of the Prime Minister's very welcome statement around the use of the budget alongside Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence for the future of defence diplomacy? We co-operate significantly together. We have the conflict pool swi a pool of -- which is a fool of a -- pool of  What the Prime Minister was alluding to is a commitment by all three departments to look at how we can do more of this to support the UK's national interests while at the same time supporting the development agenda. It is a fact that unless you have security you can't have economic development and you can't do poverty eradication. The honourable gentleman is aware the Trident missile is expected to remain in service until the 2040s and no decision on a replacement system is expected to be made during the life of this Parliament. The estimated cost remains at �2 to �3 billion for the missile itself as set out in the White Paper published by the previous Government which he We have published an update of Parliament and intend to publish these periodically. In relation to his comments about the upgrade at  that is part of the regular routine maintenance for the existing programme, irrespective of the successor programme which will  Not withstanding my honourable friend's answer will he join me in playing tribute to the brave submariners who have ensured the UK have had a continuous sea deterrence? For 50 years they have been the guarantor of our country's  I am very pleased to pay tribute to the bravery of the men and women who man our submarine  both conventional and for the deterrent and have done so for many decades. We feel this is an important component of the defence of the realm and long may it stays so under this Government. I have been taking parliamentary questions on the alternative trident reviewed. The Government are refusing to tell me how much it is costing and they are refusing to tell me what it is actually looking at. This is now blatantly the Liberal Democrats researching their manifesto at taxpayers" expense in secret. Will the Government released the details of the alternative tried a review? As the honourable gentleman should  the agreement within the coalition programme to allow the Liberal Democrats to produce their own alternative review of was something that was made clear and it is up to the Liberal Democrats to decide as and when they wish to publish the findings of that Talking of alternatives, does my honourable friend agree that the money, the few percentage points above the defence budget spent on replacing Trident gives far better value for money than the alternative of putting nuclear cruise missiles on astute Class submarines as recommended by the Liberal Democrats, almost all of them seem unaccountably absent from the chamber today? My honourable friend is a stalwart defender of the nuclear deterrent that this country has and I applaud him for that and for the debate that he called on the subject at the end of  It remains to be seen what costings are attached to the alternative plans which our coalition partners may or may not published in due course.The majority of Scottish MPs at Westminster voted against strident  just as the majority of members in the Scottish parliament  just as the Scottish Trade  the Scottish Council of Voluntary organisations, every single faith group and public opinion are against Trident at  Why is this Government ignoring the Democratic majority in Scotland and wasting billions of pounds on something that can never be used? I think the honourable gentleman should address his remarks to the workers of the Rosyth area to see how they feel about whether we retain a nuclear deterrent in this country or not. Decisions are made in this Parliament as they were in 2007 and will continue to be so. No. 3.Can I congratulate my honourable friend for taking a very close interest in  As my right honourable friend the Minister for Defence, person not veterans and welfare said it is MoD policy to offer all other entitled personnel the opportunity to provide reference samples a suitable for a DNA  This is on an entirely voluntary basis and is to enable identification, post mortem, if  I thank the Minister for  He may recall the case of my constituent who had difficulty demonstrating paternity because of a dispute over the ownership of DNA. That case was resolved and I thank the Minister for his help in that. But the real thing we need to do here is to routinely require all active soldiers to have DNA taken so that, as in the case of the Army in the  such that samples could be made  What timescale could we do this anger?The policy is currently under review and that will certainly include reviewing practice in other countries, notably in the US weather is an mandatory testing on a enlistment. Clearly this needs to be within the context of UK legislation and in particular the human tissues Act  I would anticipate the result of the current review of being available in the late spring. The Thank you, Mr Speaker. As stated in December in the first annual report on the armed forces  By enshrining the principles of the covenant in law, the covenant is becoming embedded across Whitehall. The Cabinet sub- committee led by my Right Honourable Minister for Government policy was formed in February, 28  to oversee the work and ensure the momentum is maintained. It met four times in 2012, has already met this year, at a meeting which I attended. I thank my honourable friend for that answer. What further work is being done to reinforce at a local level there need to address veterans' particular issues, for example work with housing associations? Many who have tenants as veterans who are a vulnerable position.We now have over 250 local authorities who have signed a community covenants across the country and housing is one of those issues that is often covered in such covenants. Within Swindon these issues are covered under sections four. If such a veterans have particular problems with regard to housing, as well as contacting their local council and housing associations, they can also contact the welfare service and they can also assist them with their inquiries.The Government have been tested on how seriously they take the armed forces covenant by the issue of the bedroom tax and they have failed that test. The right honourable gentleman has finally admitted in a letter to my honourable friend, the Member for  that some armed forces families could be affected by the  but he does not know  Now that we know some armed forces families will be punished by the bedroom tax, why does he think that families of prisoners and the families of students should have a year's  but not armed forces families? Mr Speaker, it is believed that very few, if any full-time service personnel will be affected by the policy as the overwhelming majority will be living in service accommodation provided by their MoD. I have met with Lord Freud to discuss this issue in detail and we believe the number of service personnel who will be affected will be really  No. 5.Thank you. Mr  we recognise as the mobile lifestyles of service personnel can create difficulty for a working partners who may have to dig up their own jobs. The Government is committed to addressing such disadvantage to assist the service families find employment go and easy access to several JobCentre Plus benefits, such as access to the work programme. However, we would like to do more. We seek to create a more stable family life which in turn should help a family members find work. I spoke to a service like this morning who told me the real disadvantage in looking for work is that they worry about saying what their husbands do and giving their address. We owe a real depth of care to these very special  What more can we do to help them? Despite the general difficult economic situation, the armed forces cover and a report, 2012, says we have seen increased employment in full-time employment for spouses and partners. It is 38%  The number of partners finding difficulty has decreased. In addition, we plan to make an announcement on regular army base  which should help to provide greater stability in future for service families. But has the Minister consider the option of having a JobCentre Plus at its service accommodation site to ensure those service families are not disconnected from the services that they are required to help them get back into work? I understand the honourable gentleman's question, but we already have a network of champions in districts and in  so we attempt to meet the requirement by doing it that way around and we believe it works.  6. I should like to answer questions six and 11 to get there. The defence budget was set for this Parliament in the spending review conducted in 2010. The budget for the financial year 15-16, will be set in the current spending round. The MoD's planning assumption is that none equipment element of the  about 60% of the total, will grow in line with inflation. It will remain flat in real terms over the ten-year planning horizon that the department uses for budgeting purposes.The National Audit Office has called into question his projections and the Department's own analysis shows that the capability gaps could arise in some areas, particularly in relation to the Army. What he published the analysis? Can he give a guaranteed today to all future, current and past members of the  that their livelihoods will not be cut due to miscalculations in the department? What I can tell him is that we have right sized the Army to the budgets we have available and we are in the process, having taken the tough decisions of drawing the Army down to its future 000. That size will allow us to properly equipped and protect our servicemen and women when we asked them to go out and do a very dangerous stop on our behalf and we believe that is the right  Given that the National Audit Office did not confirm the affordability of the equipment  with the Minister commit to publishing a more details summary of the planned with individual funding lions for individual funding programmes?The question is about the non equipment defence  but in terms of the equipment budget, we have published a plant which is more detailed than anything that has previously been  certainly more detailed than any equipment plan that was published during any of the 13 years of the Labour Government. We have gone as far as we believe we are able to do without compromising NASA security or the taxpayers' commercial interests in negotiating with defence contractors. I cannot offer her any more detail than that has already been published.Whilst ministers rightly never comment on funding for our special forces, does my right honourable friend agree that the present appraisal capabilities of our special forces, both in terms of equipment and  is a huge, national asset? Our special forces are a  a national asset and our special forces capability has been expanded very substantially in response to the needs of the operation in Afghanistan. It follows that as we draw down from our operations in Afghanistan, we will want to review some of the supporting infrastructure that has been put in place for that specific  However, we never comment publicly on the details of special forces numbers, funding or  Last week I met trade union representatives who are concerned about the future of the maintenance budget. What plans has he got in the future for the maintenance budget and whether deist you might be privatised doorknob?The current intention is that the defence support groups will be privatised and week out in the process of achieving that  In terms of the support budget for that equipment one of the very important innovations we  do you would think it was standard practice, but it has not been until now, is to ensure no equipment is allowed into the programme of for procurement unless we also clearly have a budget for that equipment support over the ten-year horizon that we budget to. Having achieved that ensures that our equipment while not only be  but will be maintained Often we hear of cyber attacks. Last month the Defence Select Committee published its report on defence and cyber security which appears to have highlighted a number of failings. Keeping in mind cyber security cuts across  does he recognise the need for even even more investment in cyber security and what percentage of any additional Governmental spend would fall to his budget?  cyber security is across Government agenda, but the Ministry of Defence is involved in that programme and the honourable gentleman is right to draw attention to the increasing frequency and severity of attacks on industrial and civilian infrastructure targets. The arrangements that this Government has put in place for a defence and security review give us a framework within which to review the response to the cyber threats that we have made and to make any adjustments in priority that should be made for the next five year period and the allocation of cuts across departments would be a matter for the next Spending Review.  having established the core equipment programme in planning round 12 as I announced on 14th May 2012, we are concentrating on delivering that core programme. We will keep under pre-view, con date projects for inclusion in the core programme in the future bearing in mind we have �8 billion of funds in the programme. Before we include any further projects, we will need to be satisfied firstly of the capability need. Secondly, that we have sufficient room within the budget to see them through to completion and sustain them to operation and thirdly, that a decision is required in order to meet proposed in service date. The National Audit Office has identified a �12.5 black hole in the department's budget plan. Can the Secretary of State say how we are going to fill this hole? The 5 billion was quoted in the National Audit Office. It was a figure based on their assess m as of -- assessment of early summer  It reported that it downgraded its assessment of the contingency requirement to �4.4 billion which is rather less than we actually have allocated in the the budget. This is my opportunity not to ask the question I feel I might have to ask for the fourth time about the defence equipment programme, but congratulate by right honourable friend and ask him what the reaction has been this clean bill of health on the National Audit Office? Well, I am grateful. Anybody who does read National Audit Office reports regularly will recognise that placed in context this was a supportive and favourable report which doesn't make us complacent. We have a lot of work to do. I can tell him that the response from industry has been  I chaired a meeting the week before last and they commented on the report and the guidance it gives them in directing their investment for future capability.  Mr Speaker. In a written answer on 11th February, the member for Coventry said the Government will not blindly pursue projects. Vital when you are looking at a core programme and yet Mr Speaker the Select Committee report on defence acquisitions suggested that this is what they have done. Conclude thaght decisions were  based on incomplete and inaccurate policy development and without the MoD understanding how the the change could be implemented. Was the Select Committee wrong to question this Government's competence?The reference that the honourable lady quoted there was to decisions made in 2010. We have received the Select Committee's  We are studying it and we will publish our response in due course. Question number eight, please Mr  Defence committed an additional �1.8 billion of investment over ten years starting last year into the reserves including for training, equipment and recruitment. Reservists will receive the kit and command training they need to enable them to to contribute as part of a fully integrated force. This operational requirement will drive the improvements in training and equipment and and provides opportunities for officers in other  There will be training training and overseas exercises have already started. These will increase from 015. -- 2015. Can I ask whether it is wise to be scrapping the regular battalions before our regulars are recruited and fully trained, before our reservists are recruited and trained?Well, my honourable friend friend whom I served for many years in the same regiment. Unfortunately, we are left in a dire financial position left by the last  We are quite confident that we will be able to recruit up 000 reserves we want, trained reserves and I believe we are heading in a good way on that. Timely and financially prudent training of reservists who are going to deploy at short notice along with regular personnel requires the Ministry of Defence to have accurate figures about how many reservists they have, how many they will be recruiting and how many are going to turn up for  Will the minister agree to place on a monthly basis the figures that show the number of new receets to re-- recruits to reservist force that is are being recruited? I don't agree to that on a monthly basis because I don't think it is necessary. I will give her the number of people in the Territorial Army in 2000 when she was a supporter of the last Government which was over 40,000. We inherited approximately 25,000. We are hopeful that we will get it 000 which is what we want to see and the figures will be very obviously and we will put them in the library of the House on a regular basis, but not monthly. The composition of the army is going to be reliant on more  with more reservists being enrolled, leading by example could the minister say how many civil serve civil servants in the Ministry of Defence will be called up as reservists? It is not a question of calling people up. All reservists are volunteers. However,  we are encouraging people in the Ministry of Defence to to join the reserves and we have amongst others my honourable friend from Milton Keynes who is a vervist and -- reservist and my month rable friend from Filton and we believe in leading by example. I would like to answer questions nine and 16 together and while I am  I would like to correct an impression that I gave. The thousands of jobs in Faslane, these are supporting the construction of the QE2 class of aircraft carrier which are the subject of these  There are over 30,000 tonnes in the dock. Containing the ship's bridges and masts will be fitted in the next few months. The ship will be largely complete by the end of this year and she will be floated off next year. The construction of HMS Prince of Wales is well underway. Mr Speaker, the Defence Select Committee say that the coalition's double U-turn on aircraft carriers cost the taxpayer �100 million plus. With Hull considering a bid for the decommissioned HMS Illustrious, even Hull may have one more aircraft carrier than the Royal  Asted honourable -- as the honourable lady heard today, the National Audit Office criticised the previous administration for the delay in the aircraft carrier which cost the taxpayer �1.6 billion so we will not take lessons on this side of the House on how to run a major procurement programme. Can the minister confirm that the Government's plans on whether a second aircraft carrier will be deployed will be based on the unit cost of the Joint Strike Fighter which is unknown due to budgetary uncertainty in America? As the honourable gentleman should know, decisions on deployment of the second aircraft carrier will be made in the 2015 strategic Defence Review. In welcoming my honourable friend's commitment to this programme, would he confirm confirm these will be the largest aircraft carriers and can I urge him not to let him put anyone off building them? My honourable friend is a champion for all matters to could with the Armed Forces and he is aware that the 000 tonne aircraft carriers forming The Queen Elizabeth sclapse will not db -- clap class -- Will be the largest naval ships built in this country. The Ministry of Defence continues to dispose of sur plas sites where a sites. We have been preparing a site for disposal by submitting an application for  I appreciate a lot is happening at Bicester. It will mean new opportunities and new jobs. But can my right honourable friend assure the House that whilst all this is going on, he will ensure that the present existing workforce is kept properly informed of what is happening and what is being planned? This is a extremely important and I believe that we will do and if we do not, I am sure he will bring this to our attention, since I first worked in the Ministry of Defence three years ago, my honourable friend has been an expont of the need for -- exponent of the need for residential development on old Ministry of Defence sites and I pay tribute to him for the work he does on behalf of his constituents. A wide range of support is available to lesbian and transgender members of the armed  Proud To Serve provides them worthwhile a -- with a communication tool. At the turn of the millennium the last Labour Government Labour Government ended the ban on homosexual men, lesbians and transgender personnel serving in our armed forces. Given that only one of his defence colleagues voted in favour of equal marriage, can the minister explain what message he thinks that that sends about this Government's commitment to equality in our armed armed forces? It was a free vote. It is - I would say with regard to the other issue that he raised, we intend to introduce an option for members of the armed forces to record their sexual orientation on a joint personnel administration system in the future if they so  In the meantime, we have expanded our trainee survey to give people the option of providing their sexual orientation again if they wish to do so. Reforming defence acquisition and support so it provides the right equipment to our armed forces at the right time is a key element of the defence transformation programme underway. This is one of my top priorities which will reverse more than a decade of mismanagement by the party opposite. We have concluded that only significant reform will solve the problems which have beset defence procurement for years and we are expecting to make decisions on the next steps of this work soon.  Thank you very much, Mr  Does the minister agree that the need to make sure the UK defence industry has support and is important to the small and medium sized businesses and what what steps is he taking to make sure they can play a part? In 2010, 40% of contracts were with small and medium companies. Next week I will be addressing a conference in Manchester on the very subject of the encouraging SMEs into the defence supply change. -- chain. Can the minister tell me what knowledge he and his department have of weapons procurement by the Syrian opposition, funded byted Saudis and -- by the Saudis and As stated in the 2010 rebuke, the Government will maintain a continuous submarine base deterrent and begin the work of replacing existing submarines. All the evidence points to a continuous, accede deterrent. A part-time  would make as a bon rapport to a pre-emptive strike and the act would risk escalation at a potentially critical moment. One of the key elements of our nuclear deterrent has been its uninterrupted nature. We must maintain this deterrent and not revert to a Lib-Dem flip flop view of the world. My honourable friend is making disparaging comments before the by-election in Eastleigh  Order. A member is not  We are never going to be troubled for any length of time than the honourable gentleman is. Topical question number two. A ministerial statement is now a forthcoming. Our priority will remain the success of the operating in Afghanistan. My priority is to deliver the military tasks for which the MoD is mandated. We are also engaged in major transformation to bring about the behaviour changed so that our armed forces can be confident of it being properly equipped and trained. We need to complete the basing of the Army from Germany, secure our target level of armed reservists. In parallel with defence transformation, I am focused on the steps we need to take to restore confidence in the future to those who serve in the armed forces after a period of turbulence and uncertainty. Why does the Government think it right that the pension age for firefighters in the defence Fire and Rescue Service is to be aligned with the civil- service age rather than with civilian firefighters when their job is no less dangerous and no less physically challenging than other firefighters? Mr Speaker, Lord Newby has been leading the negotiations on behalf of the Treasury as the Bill has gone through another place. We are working with our colleagues in the Cabinet Office and the Treasury to understand the implications of the amendment which is at the heart of  in the House of Lords, and we are at present considering how to respond. My right honourable friend will be aware of recent problems caused by former military personnel Accessing the MoD estate. I wonder if he can tell the House what steps he is taking to deal with this? I am gripper to announce a comprehensive set of measures implemented within the MoD by the Secretary of State to insure both four and current employees are clear about the rules and restrictions on access. For the first time a list of all personnel will be available for all MoD staff  The MoD Permanent Secretary has written to all four MoD personnel to remind them of their duties under the Advisory Committee and the Association of defence suppliers to ensure industry members are aware of the  Since the review, the Permanent Secretary has removed almost 2500 passes allowing access to MoD's main building, to ensure only those who require regular access are granted it and passes that have not been used for 60 days have been disabled.When ministers were last asked about the need to double the reserve force numbers they dodged the answer, instead talking about the increase in Territorial Army enquiries. Today we have heard from ministers that they are hopeful their policy will  This has been totally mishandled with missed targets and too few businesses are aware of the Government plans. Instead of talking about inquiries, while the ministers now plays on the wrecked the fact that recruitment targets are being missed because the most important issue it surely is the first step in dealing with the  rather than accepting there is a problem.The way we will not increase confidence in the Territorial Army and we will not increase reserve numbers is back arbitrarily cancelling their  relegating them to the second division, which is what his Government debt. The honourable gentleman is assuming there is an automatic link between what he says and what the Secretary of State  which is a notable parliamentary president, but it is not the job of the honourable gentleman to yell from a position. He is getting an answer and he does the Secretary of State the courtesy  It is not a president I have noticed before in my position and the opposition. We know we have set ourselves a very substantial challenge in increasing the size of the Army Reserve to 30,000. We have a number of measures in train, including a new recruiting campaign, which only started 10 days ago. We expect to make significant progress during the course of this year, and we will be publishing details of recruitment and retention figures. As my right honourable friend suggested earlier, we would do that  probably on a quarterly  Like understand HMS Albion cost about �14 million a year to sit in Portsmouth doing not very  Following the Prime Minister's new-found enthusiasm for spending on the arms services, can I suggest some of his army is used to put this one double ship to see, if not for no other reason to help the Department for overseas aid.

At that point HMS ball work will go into extended residence and HMS Albion will be placed at a high level of readiness. Bearing in mind what the ministers said about the military covenant, will the Minister now publish the impact assessment which I am sure he undertook on the effect of the bedroom tax on the armed forces and the numbers affected? I have to say to the honourable lady, I do believe she and some of her parliamentary colleagues are getting over-excited about theirs. We have discussed this and we believe that a very small number of service personnel will be affected, but we will continue to keep this matter under review. Since 1990, the Army has been reduced by about  The officer numbers are down by less than 30%. There are more Colonels than there were then. Is there more we can do to ensure that these cuts are proportionate? We are committed to reducing by 25% the star account of Brigadier and  It is true of the number of Colonels is higher than in 1990, but it has fallen by 80 the first vacancy in 2010. Some of the jobs they do are specific to NATO and we need all of these jobs and that is why we employ them. But my honourable friend raises a very good point. The Minister for Defence personnel will know that for the last two months I have been trying to secure a meeting with him to discuss the financial losses faced by army officers who have been made redundant shortly before their immediate pension point. To date he has not agreed to such a  Will he do so today and if not can he Danny how members of our armed forces should raise their concerns with his Government about broken promises on their conditions of service? I have recently written back to the honourable lady on precisely this subject. I hope she has received the letter, she is  I have written to a number of other servicemen's wives who have campaigned on the matter up. I would remind her and others who have supported the so-called tapir  is that we use it for redundancies up to 2006 until the previous Government abandoned it.  I it visited the British peace support team in Nairobi. Does the Secretary of State a grade the valuable work they do in training peacekeepers from East African forces plays a vital role in helping to bring stability, and social and political development. I paid tribute to the work they do and it is in broadly terms of peacekeeping and ending conflict went mine-clearance and we should all pay tribute to the work they do and we very much value our defence engagement in Kenya. Will the Secretary of State tell the House how many jobs will be lost at Faslane nuclear base in Scotland separates from the union? As the House will know, the Government is confident the Scottish people in a referendum will decide the benefits of union far outweigh anything else on offer and will make the right decision will stop by the honourable gentleman is right to observe that very significant numbers of jobs in Scotland depend on the operation at Faslane, not just in the immediate vicinity, but across a lot of the West of  When I was last there I made a specific enquiry about the geographical location of workers. People are coming to the base from the east coast of Scotland on a  This would affect the whole of the central area of  Constituents of mine have raised with me the worrying case of a soldier who suffers from post traumatic stress and has received recent press coverage. What steps is my right honourable friend taking to provide support to personnel such as Harry?The case is still before the court. I hope the House will appreciate it would not be appropriate for me to comment further today. However, when members of the Reserve forces they will get the same a range of accents and treatment end military run departments and community mental health if necessary.

Thank you to Mr -- thank you, Mr  I would like the Chancellor to make a statement following the loss of Britain's triple-A credit rating? Mr Speaker, this rating decision is a stark reminder of the debt problems built up in Britain over the last decade. And a warning to anyone who thinks we can runaway from dealing with those problems. And we on this side of the House will not do that. I can report Mr  that we have not seen excessive volatility in the markets  Ten year Government gilds are flat trading at 2.1%. Within the trading range of the last week and near the lowest rates of borrowing in our history, the FTSE  And the credit rating is an important benchmark for any  but this Government's economic policy is tested day in and day out in the markets and it is not been found wanting today. Families and businesses see the benefit of that in these very low interest rates. And Mr Speaker, if we accept the outcome of the rating agency decision, we must accept the reasons given for that decision. Moodies point so the combined impact of what they describe as slow growth in the the global economy and the necessary domestic public and private sector process. In other words, the process of winding down the huge debts that built up in our society over the last decade. That is the environment we are operating in. Dealing with the very hi-def sit and debt trajectory that this country had coming out of the financial crisis made more difficult by the economic environment abroad. On the same day as the ratings decision, the latest European forecasts show the eurozone deep in recession and growth in key economies like France and Germany weaker than ours,  Moodies say that the UK's credit worthiness remains high because of our highly competitive well diversified economy and a strong track record of fiscal consolidation, what they call the political well to reverse the  The UK's rating could be downgraded further if there is a reduced political commitment to fiscal consolidation. You will not get that reduced commitment from this Government. We will go on delivering on the economic plan that has brought the deficit down by a quarter, helped secure one million private sector jobs and continues to secure very low interest rates, not just for the  but for families and businesses in the country and that's the choice for Britain. We can either abandon our our efforts to deal with our debt problem and make a difficult situation very much worse or we can redouble our efforts to overcome our debts, make sure this country can earn its way in the world and provide for our children a very much brighter economic situation than the one we inherited from our predecessors. That's what I'm going to do and that's what this Government is going to do. THE SPEAKER: Mr Ed Balls.Mr Speaker the downgrading of Britain's credit rating is in this chancellor's own words a humiliation for this Government. Let me remind the House what he promised at the the general  He said that British people will transparent benchmarks against which they can judge the economic success or failure of the next government. Number one, we will safeguard Britain's credit  The first economic test he set himself now failed by this downgraded rating. He remains in  offering more of the of the same failing medicine even while Moody's agree, sluggish growth is the problem. Let me ask the  does he not now regret using the rate agency as -- rating agency as cover for the economic course he was warned was bound to  Businesses, families and pensioners are struggling. Our economy has flat lined and Government borrowing is set to be £212 billion higher than he he  but despite that, the Chancellor spent the last year  "I must stick to my plan to keep the triple-A rating." Today,  it is clear, his warnings of  of rising mortgage rates, of more ket mayhem -- maur ket -- market mayhem has not come true. He said he must stick to his plan and he said the downgrade is the reason he must stick to the plan, Mr  He used to say a downgrade to be a -- would be a disaster, he says it doesn't matter. It is utterly baffling. It is illogical, he is making it up as he goes along. No wonder the Chancellor is now besieged by calls from right, left and centre to kick start the recovery with infrastructure investment and tax cuts. The economic adviser to his rival, the Mayor of London called for more spending by the Government on infrastructure and construction. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the Chancellor needs to get out of his denial and get a new plan on growth, jobs and the deficit that will work. Or else the Prime Minister will need to get a new chancellor, Mr  Does he not see it is his first duty not to put his own political pride first, but the national economic interest and families and businesses in this country?Well, I have to say to the Shadow Chancellor, he finds himself in this contradictory position of seeking an urgent question on a rating decision he says we should  about a debt burden he admits he would add to, in order to attack a Government that is sorting out the mess that he created. What exactly is his policy? Six times on the radio he was asked this weekend whether the answer to more borrowing and too much borrowing is to borrow more? And he would not answer the question. It is an economic policy that dare not speak it's name from a Shadow Chancellor who refuses to be straight with the British people.  he was confronted on the radio by this simple statement, "I Ed Balls would borrow more." He  "yes, that's what I would " Doesn't that admission completely undermine his entire argument today? A deliberate decision to borrow more... THE SPEAKER: Order. Order. Government backbenchers whatever their intentions are in danger of shouting down their own chancellor.  Mrs Perry, calm yourself. There is always another day. The  Mr Speaker, they are as baffled as I am about the Shadow Chancellor's economic policy which he just had a few minute to say explain and still there is no  His answer to a debt crisis is to borrow more. His answer to too much borrowing is to add to it and that's the problem he  That he is responsible for the mistakes that got Britain into this economic mess. This is the verdict from a leading City economist today  the underlying causes of the UK economic weakness and hence the rating downgrade hence from the surge surge in private credit and public spending during the years 2000 and 2007 and who was in charge of economic policy during that period? He is the architect of the mistakes that gave Britain its debt problem. He ignores the solution to into debt problem. Is condemned to repeat those mistakes and as a result, his party is condemned never to be trusted with the public finances againment -- again. The truth is any Government would need a credible deficit reduction plan and the plain fact is the markets are telling us we have got  Does the Chancellor agree with the Shadow Chancellor though as he pointed out only the day before  that what the ratings agencies have to tell us given their dismal forecasting record is of very limited value?  I would say the credit rating agencies are important, but they are one test - it is the Shadow Chancellor who wants to say the rating agency decisions reason  but we should have a debate on it in in Parliament. It is a contradictory position. It is  but it is just one test of the Government's economic credibility in the markets and that is tested by the guild yields, by the value of sterling, by the rate of the the stock market and all sorts of other things and today, we have not seen excessive volatility. So what I would say to the Shadow Chancellor is we have got to convince the world that we can pay our way in the world and that is what this Government is going to do. If the Chancellor didn't want this to be the test, he should not have set it up to be the the test. Can I ask the Chancellor, does he agree with himself that for the UK to lose this triple-A rating would be a humiliation? What will be humiliating is if this country lost control of its economic destiny and the way we keep keep control of our economic destiny is deal with our  deal with the imbalances in  Make sure this country can pay its way in the world and that's what this Government is Government doing. Does my right hon honourable friend that the Shadow Chancellor would get a triple-A rating for running this country down? Does he agree that the hard-working people of this country are getting... THE SPEAKER: Order. The honourable gentleman should resume his seat. I am trying to ascertain whether the question is in order. It might be and it might not be. It is difficult to hear, but I can only make a judgement if I can hear it. Members should stop stop shreiking. I am sure you will find it is in order. The rest of the people are getting sick and tired of his antics. sick and tired of his antics. THE SPEAKER: THE SPEAKER: I am bound to tell the honourable member, I am grateful to him for his advice, but on the whole I can probably get by without it and only by a generous interpretation and I mean a generous move could that be considered to be in order, but I will have the Chancellor reMonday. -- respond. Well my right honourable is right, what is extraordinary that we have this constant criticism from the Shadow Chancellor of our fiscal  but not a clue from him about he would do, except add to  He made it clear he would add to borrowing, he hasn't said by much and he hasn't said which of the cuts he would stick with and oppose and until we have a credible alternative, we won't have The Chancellor appears to have adopted the claim he has created 1 million private sector jobs. Will he tell us how many of those jobs are in fact jobs transferred from the private sector or franchised out to the private sector from the public sector? Private sector employment is up by 1 million since  The unemployment rate is lower than when we came to  Her female employment is at its highest level in our history. Inactivity rate is at its lowest  Even though there has been a necessary reduction of jobs in the public sector, you have seen very healthy job growth in this  Does the Chancellor agreed that the state balance sheet would look and offer a lot better and the economy would function better if RBS was sorted out more quickly and sold back to the private sector in a way which promoted banking competition? I agree with my right honourable friend and RBS are now pursuing a policy of becoming a much more UK focused bank than they were under the strategy we  We are clear they should not be in the universal banking business on the scale they have  The Investment Bank should be supporting corporate and retail business in the UK. They have made important steps in that direction. While the Chancellor confirm that in the five years of this Tory-led Government he will borrow more than in the 13 years of the previous Labour Government? Let me explain something to the honourable  We inherited a budget deficit and the definition of the deficit is the amount you add to the deck every year. We are getting that deficit down in order to deal with the debt problem. His plan is to increase the deficit, borrow  had to the debt burden and repeat all the mistakes that were made by his colleagues when they were in charge. Between the mid- 1990s and 2010, the debt of the nation grew from two times the national income to five times the national income. This policy was supported by the Shadow Chancellor and the Leader of the Opposition. They advised the country should borrowed £200 billion more. Can my honourable friends at Tami what the implications for the country's credit ratings would be if they pursued those policies today? We are debating the decision of Moody's credit rating agency. They themselves on Friday said reduced political commitment to fiscal consolidation could lead to further downgrades in the United Kingdom. Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Labour plans would add around 200 billion extra to the borrowing. That is the idea of independent bodies about that Labour economic  Is that Chancellor not aware the whole country is getting progressively more sick from the phrase that there is no alternative. As long as he perseveres with these counter-productive policies there  Unless he can get in particular his national programme for investment in infrastructure  which even the director general of the CBI said he totally failed to deliver on, and until he can get that under way he is failing as a Chancellor. Infrastructure spending, money being spent on infrastructure, is higher in this Parliament than it was in the last Parliament. That is the simple facts produced and audited by the Independent Office for Budget Responsibility. We have increased capital spending of the plans we inherited and as a percentage of GDP it is higher under this Government in this Parliament than under the last Labour Government. That is what has  Does my right honourable friend not agree that it will take slightly longer than two-and-a-half years to sort out a problem that was 13 years in the making? My honourable friend puts it in a very simple way and it is a bit like the arsonist calling the fire brigade and complaining we had not put the fire out quickly enough for them. Doesn't the Chancellor realise that it has been the three-year is of continuous failure? First a  then a double-dip  now their relegation of the pound sterling. If he had been a football manager, he would have been out on his neck already. People think he is not fit to deliver the next Budget.

In the 6% retraction economic air activity it was while he was supporting a Labour  A 12% budget deficit, a higher rate of unemployment, more youth unemployment than we have  We are sorting out these  it takes time. The prescription of the honourable gentleman and other people on that site of the House would be to put us back into the mess they left us in in the first place.The only two countries that have maintained their AAA credit rating across the  Canada and Germany, I those two countries who fixed the Roath whilst the sun was shining? My honourable friend is absolutely  Germany and Canada went into the financial crisis with the HBOS strut showed deficits of the G7 and the UK went in with the highest  at 5%. The only person in Britain who still denies we had a structural deficit is the Shadow Chancellor because the former Chancellor accepts it, the former Prime Minister Tony Blair accepts  He cannot accept it because that would mean he got it wrong. He got it wrong and people would not put him in charge again. To establish our economic credibility it is suggested we need more growth in the economy. Yet our formal a Chancellor seems to be quoting former chancellors, yet a former Conservative Chancellor said it would be years before we re establish proper growth in the  How is he going to re- establish his credibility?The credibility of the Government's economic policy is tested every day in the markets and we are borrowing  low interest rates. The idea that the problems we inherited could be solved overnight was patently ludicrous. They are some of the worst economic problems any incoming Government has ever faced in his terrible start a deficit is down by a quarter, 1 million jobs have been created in the private sector and interest rates are very low and that is the success of our  Can the Chancellor confirm that two other major rating agencies still maintain Britain's triple-A credit rating and another measure of default risk is the 51 points at today, one of the lowest end the world? Mike honour will Friend is right about that credit defaults what rate and the credibility of our policy is tested out there every week. We are borrowing that record, low rates. Wouldn't the honourable course for the Chancellor to go to the next Cabinet meeting and say, I am going outside and I may be some time?The problem with the honourable  and he is pretty free with his calls for people to go because the last person he called to go was the Shadow Chancellor. Is it not correct that even before it the crisis struck that we had the biggest structural deficit pretty much in the world and a consequence of the policies of the Government Office said and no wonder we have been losing ground to economies such as India and China. It is only if we stick to our guns are we actually going to sort out our position and become increasingly internationally competitive with other economies? My honourable friend is right. The UK did have the highest struck sure bet is that going into the financial crisis of  That was confirmed by the IMF just before Christmas. If we were exporting more took Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and  We are seeking to expand our trade with those countries. It has been going up, there has been a 100% increase in our trade with  The Prime Minister led that very high delegation to India last  Can the Chancellor remind the country how many billions of pounds his Government have borrowed since he came to office? We borrow money because we are running a deficit and we are trying to get the deficit down from the 12% we  The deficit has come down about a quarter over the last couple of years. Evidence suggests this downgrade will have very little effect in the actual markets, but may I also suggest to the Chancellor that small business corporation tax cuts will bring their own reward over the medium term? I think somebody over their share tip from a sedentary position, tax cuts for the rich, when he suggested tax cuts for small businesses. That tells you everything about the Labour Party's attitude to enterprise. Let me say, we have reduced the small companies' rate. It was due to go  It is now at 20% and from the beginning of this year we have had a tenfold increase in the annual investment allowance to help small businesses.Who does the Chancellor think has been the most humiliated in the eyes of the public? The credit rating agencies who gave AAA ratings to junk investments and therefore help to cause a financial crisis, or the Chancellor who has staked everything on the same AAA rating and then lost it? Unfortunately, her list did not include the Shadow  so I cannot give her an  I can guarantee in the Dog and Duck in Wellingborough they will not be talking about Moody's rating agency. They may be talking about the lowest council tax in the  they may be talking about the thousands of homes to be built, but what the Chancellor agree with the they are most likely to be discussing the 2000 new jobs that will be created by the Bridge development bringing leisure facilities and retail facilities to my town? I think they will be talking about the new jobs being created and the jobs being created across our economy as the private sector grows. I was in the West Midlands on Friday and there has 000 increase in jobs in the West Midlands in the private sector over the last year. The number of jobs in the private sector in the West Midlands before the financial crisis shrank under the last Labour Government. The Chancellor began by saying that the gilts market has been flat today, but it is down across the board. I wonder if he could share with the House what his changed its forecast is for inflation following the fall in the pound and the cost of borrowing to the Government? Unless something has happened while the Shadow Chancellor has been on his .. The gilt market was flat  The Shadow Chancellor has admitted his plan is to borrow  and although he has a tough shared assaulting a of the disaster of Labour's economic legacy comic is seen not glad that it is not our shared when he stares at the car quashed alternative We have taken difficult decisions os os on spending d difficult decisions on spending. They complain about every cut and they never tell us about a cut they  That's why they don't have a credible Shadow Chancellor or a credible economic policy. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In 2011 the Conservative Party issued a dossier which said the that the credit rating downgrade could and I quote "could add £5,000 a year to a family family's mortgage bill." Does he stand by his laughable remark? If you lose control of the country's credibility in the international market as Labour  interest rates go up and families pay more. Because of the credibility of our economic policy, interest rates are low and they have stayed low today.  I wondered if I could remind the Chancellor that Standards and and Poors are facing procedures from the United States for Government for fraud and Moody's is likely to follow. It is a Fiat currency and that's non-  Will he quote Lord Chesterfield and they are foolish people who don't know their own foolish business. I think it was Lord Chesterfield who provided advice to his son and the advice  "Don't spend more than you have got.".The Chancellor seems determined to follow in the foot accepts of his prese sesor --  Lord Lamont. He had a bath and sang. Does the current chancellor have any plans to have a bath tonight?

Between 2000 and 2007, it rose 20  Who was in charge of the government at the time and who was the Minister for The City?We are looking at leverage rate yos and we have the -- ratios and we have the Banking Bill and of course, he is right to remind us who was the the city minister when the city blew up. In February 2010 the Chancellor asked and I quote, "What investor is going to come to the UK when they fear a downgrade of our credit rating?" I want to know does he still think that a a downgrade will chase investors away and if not, what has changed? The test of the Government's economic credibility is out there in the markets with the interest rates we can charge and in the corporate tax environment in general competitiveness of the economy we offer and since I made those statements, this country has actually become more competitive, has climbed up the league tables of international competitiveness and we had a survey last week on business tax which said this country had gone from one of the least competitive business tax regimes in the world to one of the most competitive. Could my right honourable friend reassure the House that he has no plan to Balkanise the responsibility for regulating banks. He won't sell off our gold at a low price and won let our deficit fail? We are clear when it comes to regulating the City or regulating  that we are taking the tough, he says pathetic. He was the city minister when when RBS bought AB  He should get up and apologise for it. I thank you, Mr Speaker. In May  the Chancellor said that when Britain's outlook was moved off negative that it demonstrated that the country now had economic  Now it has been  would the Chancellor like to give his assessment of our economic stability?  I know Labour MPs keep reading out the whips note. Perhaps the whips would circulate a note on what Labour's economic policy is and then we could have a more constructive debate.  Mr Speaker. Would the Chancellor agree with me that the reason why he inherited such a big deficit was was because the last Government had overspent rather than the fact we were under taxed. Isn't it the case that growth is sluggish because the tax burden is higher than the one he inherited. The deficit is higher because spending is higher than the level he inherited and isn't it about time we had proper tax cuts to put money into people's pockets to get money into the economy?We have further difficult decisions to take this year on spending in order to set the spending round for 2015/16 and I know he has always been consistent in supporting all these difficult decisions so I look forward to that consistent support in the years ahead. Over the weekend, the Labour and the Tory better together No Campaign were giving out leflets to the effect that an independent Scotland would never ever secure the triple rating of the UK just as the UK was losing a triple-A rating. Did you see he agree that the scaremongering about independent Scotland has failed and that his credibility and the No Campaign's credit credibility is nothing more than a treble Z. The SNP if they are to persuade the Scottish people will have to answer questions which they have been unable to answer about the currency they would use and the fiscal agreement they would seek if they wanted to use the pound with the rest of the United Kingdom. Some questions about the financial services industry based in Scotland and I remind him that the Royal Bank of Scotland's headquarters are in Scotland. Those are the questions they are unable to answer and as a result people doubt the case they are making for independence. Would the Chancellor agree with me rather than sneering at private sector job creation, we should be welcoming the fact that the private sector created one million jobs since the last general election. Would he assure me and the House and the markets that in framing the coalition's economic policy, he will continue to listen to those who run those businesses and are taking on the new employees and he will listen more to them than he will to the the the frontbench who landed us in this mess. We should listen to the demands the business  They want a more competitive business tax regime. They want additional help with investment and we prer we providing  They They want a lighter regular regulatory regime and we are providing that. And he is right, the businesses large and small have the engine of growth in our economy and we have had one million private sector jobs since the election. The Chancellor has been more comfortable this afternoon looking backwards rather than forwards. Would you please tell the House what is his estimate of the likely impact of reen events on the -- recent events on the sterling exchange rate and what he thinks the implication will be for inflation? I don't comment on the level of sterling and that is because at the moment actually the UK's chair of  the G7 issued a statement that we are not targeting an exchange rate. An exchange rate flows from the economic policies we pursue at home to improve our domestic economies. Does My right hon honourable friend agree for the party party opposite to have fiscal stability they should say sorry, sorry for the  sorry for the deficit and sorry for the pain they caused my constituents. My honourable friend puts it powerfully and until we hear that apology from the Shadow  frankly he is not going to have the credibility to offer an alternative. The Chancellor's message to my constituents seems to be that things are only getting worse. Could I ask the Chancellor if he could lead by example and inform the house what personal sacrifices he will have to make as a result of the downgrade? Well, my message to all families is out there in the  interest rates remain very  They have remained low today and that is the test of the credibility of the Government's economic policy and for families who are paying their mortgage bills or for businesses with their business business loan, that is crucial.

We were coming out of a contraction of the economy of 6%. He talks about flat lining. There was a 6% contraction of the economy for the period that the the Shadow Chancellor was in the Cabinet. That's what we are dealing with. We have reduced the deficit and created the one million jobs and got the low interest rates.

When we came to office it was almost 48%, a completely unsustainable position. That is how the party opposite left the country and now they want to return to that position because there is not a single cup that we have made that the Shadow Chancellor has supportive. There is an issue of accountability. In his lecture in February, 2010, which was still on the Conservative Party website this afternoon, the Chancellor said in order to bring accountability to economic policy I have set out aid bench marks against which you will be able to judge whether a Conservative Government is delivering. The first  we well-maintained Britain's AAA credit rating. How will he be held accountable for his failure?

The gilts market is black, the stock market is going up and the cost of Government borrowing stands at an historically low level.

The national debt would be added to and we will be following the kamikaze policy is of those opposite.We would have the same outcome as that which happened to the kamikaze pilots.

Is it not necessary to preserve a record low interest rates that have helped hard-pressed families and businesses in extremely difficult times? Would it not be madness to go out and borrow more money and panic and would it not put those businesses at risk? My honourable friend is absolutely right. The Institute for Fiscal Studies safe Labour plans would add £200 billion extra to borrowing. In the end the clue is how you answer the  The Shadow Chancellor was asked six times on the radio would borrowing go up under the Labour Government. He would not get an answer to that because they do not want to admit that it will go  It is the policy that dares not speak its name. As well as at the lack of growth in the economy, Moody's also cited in their downgrading decision their concern about the implementation risks around the current austerity plans. What is he doing to address those? That is the first sensible question I think we have had from the Labour Party all afternoon.

One of the challenges is the secular decline in the North Sea oilfield as it has reached its  Although we have got many more years of getting oil out of it, we have to look to that post of North Sea future and that is one of the big challenges for the SNP.

Can I urged my honourable friend to stick to the cause he has said. Following the Shadow Chancellor's plans would be a disaster for manufacturers in the North of England. Mike honourable friend is absolutely  In places he represents there are successful small and medium-sized businesses and large firms like Rolls-Royce which are supporting more, supporting -- supported by us and we have got to go on supporting those businesses as he does because they are the backbone of this country and they will provide a secure and stable economy that we need in the future. The Chancellor talked about reviving dead bodies. He may recall the Holyrood film about medical students 90 grade near-death experiences, it was called Flat  Can he make a prediction when the UK will regain its triple- A credit rating from Moody's? First  I am not going to make a prediction about that because whilst Moody's are very clear that we can win the rating back but provided we show our commitment to dealing with our debt, rebalancing our economy and we are going to provide that commitment. They are also very clear in their market noticed that a reduced commitment to fiscal consolidation would risk further downgrades and that is the policy advocated by the Shadow  Can my right honourable friend remind the House that he has cut the deficit by a quarter under this Government? Can he remind the House that Labour chancellors ran out of money and had to go to the IMF to be bailed out? It is an eternal truth that all Labour governments have left office with unemployment higher than when they came in and they have all left of his leaving the country with a fiscal crisis. Let's make sure that history does not repeat itself. That Chancellor of the Exchequer has quite simply lost all credibility as an individual, all credibility as a Chancellor. What will he do to ensure he can regain the confidence of the general  Hundreds of thousands of people who have lost gravy as a result of the failure of his economic policies.The actually, the unemployment rate is lower today than when we came to office. 1 million people have got jobs and the private sector that were not their two years ago. Families want to know they have got a Government that is determined to tackle the nation's problems, keep the rates  make sure we provide the right environment for business, and they can have that assurance. One of the problems highlighted by the downgrade was the sluggish nature of international growth. With the Chancellor used the forthcoming G7 finance ministers' meeting in made to encourage other countries to keep on the path to lower their own debt and to make sure we generate the international growth that will benefit all the countries in this  I agree with all the sentiments expressed by my honourable friend. All countries are confronting their debt problems, in the Western world, and where it comes to trade one of the big initiatives we need to pursue, principally through the G8 leaders, rather than the G7 finance  is the possibility of a free-trade agreement with the United States. It was very encouraging the President mention that in his inauguration speech and that is one objective alongside the EU free-trade agreements alongside India and Japan that we should be pursuing in the coming months. Last  just before he was booed at the Olympics the Chancellor said the triple-A credit rating of this country showed the world had confidence in his policies. What does he think the downgrading showers? As I have been explaining for the last 57 minutes, actually, the test is there each day, each week that we have to borrow money to fund the deficit. That is the test and the world at the moment is lending us money and some of the cheapest rates in our history. My right honourable friend confirmed that a significant part of the deficit is structural, meaning that vital as growth is, it will not do anything to reduce the structural  The fact we need to start living within our means again means until they understand that they will not be fit to return to office. My honourable friend is absolutely right and one of our objectives is on the structural deficit. What I would say to my honourable friend is the structural deficit is the part that does not go away when the economy grows. The argument you get from the Shadow Chancellor is that all these problems will disappear when be economy grows. That was his argument before the financial  That is why Britain went into the financial crisis with a five present structural deficit. That is why when boom turned to bust the country found itself without any money. Unemployment in my constituency is still higher than it was a year ago. Many of those people on the dole queue feel humiliated they cannot find a job under this Chancellor's policies. Does he not accept he should lose his job? Nov course, we are working in the North East as elsewhere to create the right conditions for businesses to grow. Unemployment  1 million jobs had been  youth unemployment has fallen as well. There are a record number of jobs and there are a record number of women in work. Those are things that are welcome, but we have got to do well Mora to help businesses grow, and that is I made it very clear that the credit rating is an important benchmark but it is one of many and we are tested every day out there in the market and what we have not heard from the Shadow Chancellor is any alternative. It is all well and good criticising the Government's  but what is the opposition's alternative? He need a policy to attack one. -- you need. This time two years ago, the Chancellor was telling us that he had already created 500,000 new jobs most of which were probably the result of the economic stimulus of the previous government so that .. Unless of course it is instant response in six months but perhaps it is but that still leaves the much slower rate of growth of new jobs since that date. Maybe he is not aware that his own employment minister admitted at the last Department for Work and Pensions questions that jobs were people were working without wages were included in his totals, isn't it time he went back and looked at the reality of these so-called employment figures? Frankly, the numbers she posed and nonsense. Employment creation rate last year was the highest rate since 1989. Does the Chancellor think that their loss of the UK's credit- rating is what his honourable  the Prime Minister, was thinking of when he said the good news would just keep coming? Last  we had the good news that unemployment had fallen again, employment had gone up and we had the forecasts from the European Commission which says that while, they want UK growth to be higher, it is forecast to be higher than  Germany and many of our neighbour had partners. But we are confronting our country's problems. The Chancellor's response to the question today has proved that as  it is politics first before  Now that he has failed the test he set himself, will he turn his attention to the test that the people of Wirral set him, what will he do to the people who cannot get the hours they need in work to put the food on the table? Of  we want to help people who are not currently working the hours they want to work by helping businesses to expand, to take on more people but work in the economy, as well as jobs going back up by thousands and private sector jobs by around one million, hours worked in the economy has also gone up so the Labour argument that it is all to do with under employment is not  People who want to work  the best way to do that is to create an environment where businesses want to expand and take  Doesn't the Chancellor accept that the reason that things have not moved in the wake of the downgrading is not a tribute to the economic policy but it is in fact a mood of pessimism about the long term growth policy? If that were  why would German rate be lower than ours? On 2nd February,  the Chancellor said "we will protect Britain's credit rating and international reputation".

I am most grateful, Mr Speaker! If one of the Chancellor's pounds in the banks have lost that Bank's AAA credit rating, they would have gone. So what the Chancellor become full-time and changed his plan or go? Not sure that was worth it, the weight but I would say to the £1 that he either thinks it is important that we come from the debt problem in which case he should support me as we take difficult decisions or he thinks it is not important and we take a difficult situation and make it worse and frankly, no matter how many for handwritten notes he has, at the anyone I remember from the Labour Party is the one that said there was no money left. Mr Speaker, in the name of protecting our AAA credit rating, the Chancellor cut £4 billion in affordable housing  pushing housing benefit bills up and creating the biggest housing crisis in a generation. Rather than continuing to borrow to pay the costs of failure, will the Chancellor now endorsed the call made by the Shadow Chancellor for investment in affordable housing to create jobs and apprenticeships and to get an economy moving that he has failed to do? That is a call for yet more borrowing which, at least the honourable gentleman is happy to abdicate that in the House of Commons but the Shadow Chancellor there's not talk about economic policy. When it comes to capital spending, the plans that we inherited from the last Labour  agreed to presumably by all members of the Cabinet, were lower than the plans we have now. And that is because we have taken difficult decisions on welfare bills and other areas of resource spending in order to invest in capital and when it comes to  with schemes like first by, new bike and the new housing  we are getting behind the housing industry is -- new buy. The levels of housing starts under the last Labour government was that the lowest rate since the 1920s. That is the situation they let us People in my constituency a few months ago gave a verdict on be the pick is responsible for the state of our economy. Jobseeker's allowance went up by 127 in my constituency, it is the toughest place to find work. Does the Chancellor realise how out-of-touch he will sound to a government that is on their side? How can he tell foreign investors to invest in my constituency and others given that he has failed his own test? Foreign investors are investing in Britain and that is something he should welcome and we are also investing in the East Midlands.

That every child should be able to experience an outstanding education. And that every child should not just a matter that be able to make a difference.

I am grateful for my honourable friend for his intervention and to pay tribute to the work he did in opposition and working with him on trying to enhance the rights of children are particularly to recognise the role that many wider family members play in delivering good care for children across the country. We want to make sure through this bill that we give every child the best opportunity to have a fulfilling involvement with their parent and also their wider family. In doing  recognise the role that grandparents often do in fulfilling that important role. He has made an important point about the wider family in caring for children but would he take on board what is the most important people here, the children themselves and putting them at the centre is the critical role of this legislation and anything we do in this House? That should always come first. Even when it is potentially in conflict with We need to make sure that whatever changes we make have children's rights at the heart of Audit citizens -- all the decisions we make. I'm grateful to the Minister. He will be aware of the campaign around children's disabilities. Is he coming to that in his speech?

It is stronger for the fact that we have consult the young people on the key proposals throughout, and continue to do so. I want to put on record my thanks to Roger Morgan, the Children's Rights a better, for enabling many of them to contribute. We have come up of course, listens  The bill has evolved into its current form through numerous consultations. We have sought a wide range of views, right from those to provide services to those to benefit from them. This is particularly true of provision for special educational needs. Pathfinders have tested our reforms to make sure that they are delivering on our aims. I'm grateful to colleagues but he and in the other place for all of the care and attention that has gone into preparing the bill. Large sections have been enhanced by examination from the scrutiny of four parliamentary committees, and the advice of members on both sides of the House. I recognise the importance of taking into account parents'  such as my constituents'.

She thinks that as loud as she is, she is speaking on behalf of those who cannot 000, who cannot get the basic provision. Will this be an answer to some of her concerns? The story of my honourable friend's constituent is one I have heard from many members who have come across many battles that parents with children with special educational needs find they have to  day after day. They have to duplicate information, tell their story again and again. Or rather than finding themselves working in partnership with local of Verity's and the health service, often find themselves in conflict with them. - - local authorities. This bill is designed to tackle that head on, to make it more family-oriented. It will be a system that has a single process to make sure that those difficult transition periods are dealt with in a much more smooth and co-ordinated way, so that many of the problems that my honourable friend partner constituent has had  given quite recently, be much reduced in the future. We hope that will lot had at all. I'm grateful to the Minister, and I compliment him on many of the measures of the Bill, which I'm sure will be welcomed. But he will be aware there are some concerns that the standards will not be mad for special educational needs, and people are concerned that with it school action no longer continuing, they may fall out of the scope of the local authority. How can the Minister assure those parents? I will come on to those particular  It is important to say at this juncture that we are not changing the definition of special educational need. It is clear from the Ofsted report in 2010 that there has been over identification of many children who have been labelled as school action plus, which is not addressing the core concerns around their presentation and their ability to progress through school at a satisfactory  And what we want to do is put a greater emphasis on outcomes and personalise the support that children get through school, and if necessary through a plan, if they meet that criteria. But we are not changing those definitions. We are making sure that the current rights that parents and young people enjoy through the system will be protected into the D system, and in fact enhanced as they will be going beyond the age of 16 up to 25, where it is considered appropriate.

We must all we can to reduce the time it takes for a child to be adopted. My honourable friend deserves real recognition for his personal crusade to tackle this problem. The Bill builds on that work to create a system further focus on the needs of children and involves adopters. I thank him for giving way. Will the Minister accept that there are  including myself, he believed that at times, children are adopted who should not be adopted?

I don't think anybody would disagree that it is important there we reduce the timescale for children to be adopted. But what safeguards does the Minister plan to put in place to ensure that we don't see an increase in the number of failures? That is an important  We know that the level of adoption break down, ranging from  is probably the worst of all for those children, let alone the families who have been brave enough to put themselves forward as prospective adopters.

That support may be  even at a light touch  for many years in the future. I know from my own experience, even  30 years on, there may be moments when the experience prior to going into care comes back to haunt an individual. Therefore, we need to be mindful that where adoption support is going to be  that the opportunity is there for it to be available. That is why this deal comes on to deal  -- this bill.

And a place real obstacles amended? And a place real obstacles in the wake of kinship carers, is the Government looking at that? I am aware of the issue that the honourable lady races and I have just set out the principles that remain in place and it is worth noting that the concept of fostering for adoption is not a new phenomenon and there are a number of authorities that already used fostering for adoption - East  for example, and very  This is not trying to undermine the principles which already exist where local authorities must look at potential future placements within the family before they go on and consider a placement outside the family. That will pertain as a consequence. Mr Deputy Speaker, we also know that black children take on average a year longer to be adopted than white children or children of other  This is totally unacceptable. As the recent report from Birmingham City Council illustrates, adoptions and been blocked and misguided to find the perfect ethnic match over and above all other considerations. I want to make absolutely clear for the avoidance of any doubt that we do not intend that ethnicity will never be a consideration. It should not put a placement which is in the best interests that can provide them at a loving family. This Bill will remove the explicit requirement to have regard to the racial origin and cultural and linguistic background when matching a child and prospective adopters and in doing so, ensure quicker and more balanced decision-making when matching them for adoption. As of  2012, there were 4630 children waited for adopting family. We need more than 600 additional a doctors a year just to keep up with the growing number of children waiting and to address the Member for certain central's point, we have a situation in which lots of  local problems are adding up to a big national crisis. There are currently around 180 adoption agencies including 152 local authorities is recruiting and assessing an average of 17 adopt hers per year. Many operate -- the doctors per year. This is a system which simply is not fit for purpose and we need to make sure that the national crisis of children waiting for people adopting ends and as soon as possible. So we are working and continuing to work with local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies and have provided them with over 150 million to scale up with adoption recruitment services and bolster capacity to meet growing demand. If local authorities are not able to develop a sustainable approach, which would be prepared to use the provisions in this bill that enable the Secretary of State to require some of all authorities to outsource adopting recruitment and Assessment focusing too other agencies. As we were discussing a few moments ago, sadly there are adoptions would break down. With inadequate therapeutic and other forms of support being a contributing factor. But we know where there are well planned support systems, we know it can help prevent problems which can lead to a breakdown of placement. People adopting the to be confident in the support available but this has been sadly lacking with many people adopting not been made aware of their right to request an  We are placing a duty on local authorities to provide information about the support  We are also introducing personal budgets to give adopting families more control over this abides the support and how that is  -- who provides this  The adoption register will allow doctors to take a more active role -- allow adopting families to take a more active role. Together, the measures in the Bill will mean more children being adopted more quickly where that is the right thing for them. And it will mean people adopting will have a greater degree of control and support they can get those children the best start in life. I thank the member, for giving way. I wonder if he could ensure Barnardo's members who would point out that 80% of current adoption is carried up by local authorities and that ministers do not want to put force organisations to move to the voluntary sector who may not have the capacity to stand  I am grateful to the chairman of the select committee and I take the question that he pots in the spirit that it was meant -- that he  £1 million has been provided to the consortium of adoption agencies to boost capacity and they have already seen a growth of 20% this year and the year before but also recognising that they are only 20% of the current market run by scaling up the market into a more astute economy of scale, we are ensuring that we are moving to a mixed market maximising the capacity across the country to meet  But we do not want to sit by and watch this money have no effect and that is why we have the enabling clause within the Bill to make whatever changes are necessary to get the numbers of adopting I thank the member, for giving way. He is being very generous with his time but also setting out a compelling vision for the future of children and the adoption system however he is using language such as "market and demand" which does also create anxiety with relation to the point raised by the honourable member immediately before May and I wonder what discussions the Minister has had with the Department for local communities and government about the impact of some of these changes on local government given the crippling cuts that many local authorities are being currently faced with through the changes that this government has also implemented? Well, we have just provided local authorities with £150 million to improve adoption services so this is a good opportunity for them to show how they can deliver that for care. I do not say why the honourable lady should feel that is not an appropriate way of trying to resolve this national crisis. We are trying to have a practical solution to a problem whereby simply by having 180 adoption agencies or more, all with no incentive to recruit beyond their  we are preventing children from having opportunity at being placed with a family who are waiting for them potentially in a different part of the country and we want to break down those barriers to make sure every child whose future is in adoptive placements get that opportunity I thank the member, for giving way. Isn't the key issue that there 500 children currently waiting to be adopted and yet potential adopting families are put off by the process and the intrusive nature of the process and the Czechs they are asked to complete? Should we not due mind that to encourage adopting people to come forward rather than local authorities or adoption agencies? Where honourable friend is correct and that is why we are streamlining the assessment process so it will take no longer than six months whereas I have heard of cases are taking up to three years for a couple or single person to be  And also a single point of advice and information for anyone interested so that they are not being immediately cocooned within their own authority area for looking at potential assessment and thereafter matching. We have been what we can but across the system to make more led by people adopting and streamlined so we can break down barriers which have existed for far too long in the adoption  In a response to the question opposite, with my honourable friend not agree that not only is there more money going in there because the system will be  and the children in the adoption will move faster, that is where the savings will come from. One of the reasons we want to encourage local authority through this additional funding to move into a consortium-tap arrangement is it reduces overheads and as I  we have over 180 adoption agencies recruiting, around 17 adoption families per year. Huge scope within the system to make savings and get the money will be bought it and help children getting  Very quickly and I will  I will congratulate him on the way he is presenting this to  Is there any link that he has with the data between speed of prices and the success of that placement?We know from research done by Bristol University that for every year a child is not adopted, another 20% reduction of their prospect of them being adopted so we need to make sure that where adoption is timely and that the matching process has been done in conjunction with the adopting  we would get children in the right placements in a quicker and more quality-assured way that may have done in the past. What we know is that the longer children wait to be adopted, the best prospect there is of them being adopted and we also know that adoptive placements are some of the most secure and stable placements outside of the family. Clearly, there are still breakdowns which take place and that is what we are looking at every stage of the process to make sure that support is made available and information being given to prospective adopting people is as transparent as possible so that we ensure that the prospect of any breakdown are reduced to a bare minimum but the point that the honourable gentleman makes is an absolutely key one and one that we bear in mind as we push the proposals forward. Not all children in the care system should be adopted but for all children, the difference it makes when somebody cares whether you do well at school is critical. When somebody has high aspirations for  you are more likely to have them for yourself. Yet in 2012, only 15% of children who had been knocked out the continuously for 12 months or more achieved five or more GCSE grades at A star sea- level including English and maths.

Decisions are child focused and aimed at reducing duplication in the system. We know just how important family courts are in making sure that a vulnerable children end up inappropriate placements safely. But we need to do more to speed up the prices and make sure that children can find stability as quickly as possible. To this end, the children families bill includes measures to tackle the lake through the introduction of a maximum 26- week time-limit for completing care and supervision proceedings. We also want to see a reduction in the number of additional expert report commissioned by insuring that evidence is used in children's cases only where necessary and not as a matter of routine.

Just over 000 children were subjected new resident cases in 2011-2012, and for many families involved, the process can be drawn out and emotionally draining. As somebody who has spent 10 years practising as a family law barrister, I can testify that this is rarely the best way to resolve family disputes. Taken together, the private law proceedings in this bill keep the needs of children firmly at the centre of the system, while acknowledging the important role that both parents should play in a child's life, opposed separation. Our starting principle is that separated parents should resolve their disputes out of court where  The bill makes attendance at mediation a prerequisite for applying to court for certain types of family proceedings.

It is important to retain separated family members in the child's life. But does he acknowledge the part of the problem that we are going to face in retaining separated parents' involvement is the implications of the bedroom tax, where perhaps a separated parent is actually going to be penalised for keeping bedrooms so that their children can visit them during holidays and weekends? Is that not counter-intuitive to what he is trying to achieve? I will try to kill two birds with one stone in that regard. This is not a matter for this bill. I'm sorry that the honourable lady has not chosen the opportunity to raise the substantial issues which are within the Bill on this occasion.

The case for reform is clear - the systems to support children with SEN all too often leaves families struggling to get the support they need and deserve. Over a quarter of parents of children with autism so they have had to wait more than two years to get their support that the child needs at school. The time it takes for children in care to find suitable permanency is often far  On average, it takes over 5 years for an adoption to be completed and four children who are black and minority ethnic it takes an average of one year longer. Whilst we must ensure that the best interests of the child are upheld, delays to finding the right match are at the expense of a child's development. The family justice system is to work in the interests of resolution and mediation retaining the primacy of the interests of the child and can a place on record my thanks to David nor grow for his work both for the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government for reforming family justice -- David nor Grove.

For  strength and the role and remit of the Office of Children's Commissioner which can ensure that the primacy of children's right will be protected in future and I thank John Dunford for the work he has done for the Government in this  In 2004, the children's Act created the every child matters  I believe this is as relevant and important today as it was in 2004.

Our ambition then as it is now is to raise the educational outcomes for children from all backgrounds but particularly those from the poorest  children with SEN and disability and within the care  Hard-working families who are currently being hit by the rising cost of childcare and cut to maternity pay will welcome changes that enable flexibility for parental leave following the birth  The previous government introduced statutory maternity leave which was an important turning point for many farmers -- paternity leave.

Turning to special educational needs, the educational select committee was correct in its report to say that the Green Paper in 2011 set high expectations and hopes for children  All of us across the House will have been contacted by parents in our constituencies of children with SEN. The story is .. Of course, I will give  I thank the member, for giving , I appreciate the Minister was trying to cover quite a lot of ground quickly but I thought his response to his honourable friend for Blackpool North was extremely disappointing and it is to be an issue probably concerning. Does my honourable friend agree that too many children will be left out by the proposals as they currently stand? This is particularly true for children with dyslexia who will bead excluded from these plans. I do share his concerns and that will be coming to a number where I feel the deal needs to be improved during the committee process. There is a familiar story that all of us will have experienced in our own constituencies. Parents having a lack of information about the support that is available. They then have a long, drawn-out battle to secure the additional support that their children need and then even when it is offered, endless jumping through hoops to get the services that are really needed for their family. There is no doubt that we need a radical transformation of the SEN system. If we go back to 1981, the Warnock  introduced the process of statementing as well a statement for inclusion of children and young people with SEN in mainstream  Since then we have seen numbers of reforms including the requirement on the Secretary of State to publish annually the numbers and outcomes of children and young people with SEN following a campaign led by my honourable  the shadow children and families minister, the Member for Washington &amp; Sunderland West. My honourable friend may know that at the age of 22 months if one prepares the cognitive ability of the poorest children, the top 25% with the bottom 25% of middle-class  the middle-class children overtake the poorer children at the  Is he therefore concerned that most children with speech and language and communication needs, will not be included in educational health and care plans and therefore will continue and exacerbate this problem? I thank my honourable friend and he, like our colleague, anticipates points that I will be  The general point which makes the case for early intervention, amateur to which I will return at the end of my remarks here this evening but crucially some of the weaknesses in the Bill that we hope to probe both in today's debate but also when the bell goes before the committee. -- when the builders before the  -- when the Bill does before the committee. As the honourable gentleman nose, I am particularly interested in what happens to people with autism. What he support what the group recommends on autism, that the most difficult time for children is that transition for are not had and what he probed further during committee stage as to whether we could have special individual transitional plans for those people with autism as they move into employment or further education? That is where the point is often the most difficult for families and individuals. I thank the right honourable lady and pay tribute to her long-standing work on this including securing legislation on this and I was moving on to the elements of this plan that we do support that include the extension to the age of 25 and that is something I know she has campaigned for which the Government is now proposing and which we very much welcome for the reasons that she  We support this which from statements to education health and care plans and we show the ambition to encourage joint working between different agencies in drawing up the plans and providing the services described in them. We also welcome changes that have been made following campaigning by  by parents supported by Labour and also through the pre- legislative scrutiny that will maintain access to independent special schools and colleges as well as an option for children with SEN and also that education health and care plans will be extended to those young people taking apprenticeships. What I think is striking about this part of the bell is not so much of the provisions within it but what is not in this part of the bill. If the Government is going to meet the high expectations that it has raised itself, there are important changes that will need to be made during the passage of the bill. As this legislation is currently  the plans will offer no more legal entitlement to support from health and social care than statements offer at the moment. We will press for stronger requirements through the passage of the bell and to strengthen the plans for those two are in post-19  -- those who are impost- 19 education. I will give way. I agree with him on the point on imposing on health but the NHS has constitutional requirement which can conflict with attempts to impose duties on it and I wonder whether the honourable gentleman have thought up some creative ways  It absolutely makes the case for the agenda on health and social care that the Shadow Health Secretary has been setting out, moving to looking at the whole person approach. And turned up adult health and social care, I think this bill is an opportunity to demonstrate it can be the case for young people as well. Let me turn to the point raised by the honourable gentleman, the Member for Blackpool North because we also agree with the select committee that disabled children should be included in the provision of educational health and care plans were the wrong not they have a learning difficulty. These plans should codified and bring together the current entitlement for disabled children and young people. The statutory rights that young people have in terms of both assessment and provision are already laid out in disability legislation so including disabled children would serve to promote better co-ordination and integration and the duties that already exist and could even lead Some of those children were not in  and therefore going to  Isn't that an hairier we must look at again to help those families who are in the hospice movement? -- and hairier.The judge Sir Johnny Ive -- the honourable One in six children with additional needs will not be catered for under these plans.

We have had a situation where we have used Super affirmative resolutions. One of the other things is the regulations, and the component parts of the local office should be contained in those regulations. I think that is absolutely right and sensible.

Parents were told that this bill would represent an end of the struggle for support, and also an end to the adversarial nature of  I think there are still unanswered questions which potentially undermine this goal. Let me move now to a question over adoption and children in care. It is clearly one of the state of mind but important duties to care for children who are without a say family to care for them. -- the state's most important duties. We know that failings have let down some of the most vulnerable members of our society, and in the most extreme cases have cost children and young people their lives. I welcome the emphasis that has been placed on reducing the time for completing an adoption and increasing the number of adoptions when it is in the best interest of  Let me put on record my thanks to Martin Mere, who has done so much to champion the rights of  and the Times newspaper for its campaign to address the  We should recognise the incredible commitments made by so many who work in the care system.

There are important developments in social care that we should  Let me today welcome the fact that the Government has contributed funding to the front line initiative for social work. The front line has the potential to play an important role in raising performance in the care system, both for those working in the system and four D new recruits that it will bring in. Measures of educational attainment for children in care show the scale of the challenge. I am aware that young carers can also have low attainment when it comes to education. Would he agree that it is critical that the work of organisations should support  but they also need to be financially viable.  I will be coming to the question of young carers shortly. I pay tribute to the organisation in my honourable friend's constituency, to which he referred. We know that organisations of that kind do an absolutely fantastic job, often with very limited resources. They have often borne the brunt of the recent cuts in local spending. Let me welcome the introduction in statute of virtual school at heads, the placement of a duty on local authorities to promote the achievement of children in their care through a designated virtual head teacher. A well since -- welcome also the bill's emphasis on reducing delays in adoptions. But I have concerns about removing completely any statutory requirement for consideration to be given to ethnicity in determining the placement of a child. We support the government's attempts to address this issue. We should indeed reduce the prominence given to ethnicity. But I think we must not move to the other extreme, where it could be ignored entirely, which I think is the risk in the current drafting of the deal. We do believe that ethnicity should remain a consideration, and it is important that adoption agencies are clear about this. The weight of evidence points to delays being primarily caused by the age and health of children. Last year, after a reported, and I quote, there was little evidence of delay caused by an unrealistic search for a perfect ethnic match. Can we share the view of the House of Lords adoption Select Committee, that the requirement for two consideration on ethnicity should be on the statutory welfare checklist that the courts and adoption agencies must consider. It is also important for us to consider other forms of permanency alongside the Dobson. Other options that may be in a child's best  -- alongside adoption. As my honourable friend said  there are no provisions in the Bill to strengthen the rights of young carers. Just to say that I think it is an important point. I have been serving on the committee for the draft clearance support bill, and there was a promise that this matter would be covered in both  We have had a battle on the committee to strengthen it there.

A similar measure in Australia created and a expectation that shared parenting meant equal time and led to courts becoming more clogged up as parents challenged decisions made on the basis of a child's best interests, turning relatively straightforward decisions into lengthy conflict. Does he not acknowledge, though, that what was deposed and became law in Australia was very different to what is being proposed now? Anything that can in any way be interpreted as equality of time would not work. That is why the wording of this bill, which has taken a lot of work and effort, is absolutely not a presumption about a quality of time but is a presumption that all of us must agree that a child does best when both parents have as much involvement in the childhood of the child as possible subject to the welfare provisions which absolutely still stay paramount within this  Why will it again, on his  not recognise there is a problem that we at last have legislation trying to address?

But in the end, for me, the paramount principle has to be the welfare of the child. That has to  The concern is this could take us down the road that the Australians went down. We should explore the issue further. I would urge ministers to listen to those who are expressing a different view so that we make sure that we don't have as an unintended consequence something that makes the situation worse than it is now. The Bill also proposes a 26 week limit for care proceedings. At  children would on average 55 weeks for a decision about their  -- children wait. We are trying to assess this.

I will  I thank the member, for  Of course his point about the work that local authorities do prior to care proceedings do is extremely important and that is why we put emphasis on conferencing and try to get as much evidence required for the case to be dealt with as quickly as possible. That is there at the inception. Does he agree with me that we cannot continue with a situation where, in one  the average time of a care case being dealt with his 17 weeks? And Another Case is 89 weeks. The work they are doing in London has seen in a pilot a reduction of their limit to 24 weeks below the 26 weeks that we are proposing in this bill? The Minister makes the reasonable points. My understanding is that setting at a time limit in primary legislation is unusual internationally, possibly unique. That is not sufficient grounds to do it but it is unusual. But the proposals from the justice committee address the legitimate points but the Minister raises in his intervention just now but they do it in a way that would both enable timely decisions but also allow for greater flexibility in individual cases. I think that is sensible as a compromise proposal that the select committee has put forward which I hope the committee stage of the Bill will consider. That my turn now to child care. There is a childcare crisis in this country right now. -- let me turn out to child care. The Government's proposals to change childcare ratios have been widely criticised as a threat to quality and we oppose the provision in this bill to remove the duty on local authorities to conduct an assessment of the sufficiency of childcare at least every three  On child care agencies, we are very much welcome the idea of additional support for childminders to promote work was development and progression, to increase  to share best practice and improve local court nation to help parents find a good child  However, the plans as they stand are hazy on detail.

Ministers need to clarify what this will mean for local authorities, how often Ofsted will inspect agencies and how the criteria for inspecting agencies will differ in nature from the inspection of individual childminders. Does my honourable friend not also share a concern that just as we have seen in the all the care sector, we could see ETA's is creaming off profits and adding costs rather than supporting better childcare -- we could see agencies creaming off Prof -- off  I hope these are an opportunity to raise quality in these sectors. I think if this is not carefully managed unco- ordinated with their role still poor local authorities in the childcare sector there is a risk we could go down precisely the path that my honourable friend has  The quality and cost of childcare as bad as parental confidence in their childminders -- as well as parental confidence should be at the centre of considerations made in this regard. Let me say a few words in conclusion. Since 2010, this government has moved away from the previous Labour government's emphasis on early intervention and we very much welcome the additional funding that has been allocated to adoption but why is it that this Government always raids were the early intervention budget for these new forms of funding? We are halfway through a Parliament in which the Prime Minister told us that we would have the most family- friendly government in Europe. Instead we have seen a £1.1 billion cut too early intervention funding, a 10% reduction in the childcare element of working tax credits and cuts to Sure Start centre as which mean there are now 400 fewer Sure Start centres than in 2010. On the side of the House, would welcome the opportunity to debate the agenda on children and families not least because it is an area that has been sidelined by this  We will work throughout the passage of this bill to reach a cross-party consensus on a lasting  our policy will be led by evidence and what is in the best interests of the children and families of this country. I think this legislation gives Parliament an opportunity to reaffirm the principles of every child matters and for Parliament to send a message to the Government that inclusion and children's well-being go hand in hand with high standards of education. Eight-minute limit,  Can I welcome this bill. It is a pill of many parts and specifically I wish to address the clauses dealing with family law. The issue here is the need to address the long-standing failure of the legal, judicial social services and educational systems to adequately safeguard children who need to be taken into care. A system that is costing the taxpayer £150 million a year and is straining to keep up with increased demand -- £950 million. In 2011, 492 children are increased in  The average case took 12 weeks but by 2011, this was 54  By last year, it had fallen to 48 weeks and I was pleased to hear that it has fallen again to 47  The family justice review... We owe lots to the group who carried out that review. At least seven reviews of family justice have been taken place since 1989 and more money would not be the answer even if it were available. It is fundamental reform that we  The central part of the report tries to pull together desperate strands and to provide children with a voice, to unify the service and to provide effective  That position of ban on the ground was as poor a system I have ever seen in any system.

In the single family court, it has been proposed in the crime and  It should also mean that the right level of Judge be allocated to the case. As the Minister noted, much of the framework of the family justice reforms have already been put in place of the past two years. The key 26 week timetable for completing care and supervision proceedings would probably mean little if we had not already set up the national family justice board to orchestrate cross Agency strategy at the centre and local family Justice Board to review performance at court level backed up by new performance figures starting from last year for each and every court. The key point being that it the 26 weeks limit is not being reached, then we will not only know where but by how much it is being out and one of the reasons for the delay and patterns of support before was in that area. In  more potters of action and best of the old blame culture should be the result -- more powers of action and less of the old blame  I am afraid that government will have to play a part  Policy floated without effective leadership for too long between education and Justice Department and also of the  The delay added to the detriment of children's best  The I -- I am glad to see this is being addressed. I hope this joint working continues and now with the new Family Justice Board to be included. A good working relationship is key to implementation but we need to appreciate that the review proposed and government agreed that Cath Cass is to be moved to the Ministry of Justice so could be no street please advise on the timing of this? From my own experience I would also recommend that the child as Minister been mooted jesters from education in contemplation of this operation will shift.

It will not happen overnight but we need tough tie is -- this also at this is a time limit to be worked towards. I recognise the sterling work of modernisation. We should note that  family law has been a poor relation to criminal law being sometimes due to lack of time given to family cases, judges have gone back to criminal work. And judges will need to spend more time on looking at these courses for delay and why the service has been worsened as a result. Finally, concerning fire -- family law I wholeheartedly supported the placing into the Bill of the assessment meeting requirement. It has been supported by a protocol for over one year, by placing it in statute hopefully those parts of the country where the courts have been overlooking the need and of the framework to go to mediation will now have to take note the Government were correct to be cautious over the just a select committee proposal that judges should make decisions on the merits of compliance. Mediation is an alternative to judgement and I am delighted that mediation is increasing and it is a cheaper and quicker process than court and both parties the to buy into the process as a result and they are better result and less divisive. There is a long way to go on improving family justice in this country but I believe that this bill will help assess itself in the right Mr Deputy Speaker, on the first three quarters of this bill, I have both personal and family experience and in both local and central government and I want to start by congratulating my honourable friend, the shadow secretary for his speech and his emphasis of the overall approach that needs to be adopted to invest in the well-being of young people and families from the earliest years. I want to say to the Minister, his personal commitment and gust the issues is of Pearce and welcome -- and a grasp of the issues. I would not like to see him move to the Justice  I am sure the Secretary of State for Education will give him the kind of support that would be needed to be able to do the job. On the first course, I want to simply say that the welcome streamlining and speeding up of adoption with safeguards is welcome but as had been mentioned in interventions, forget the critical role of families, and the role of intensive fostering which often gets forgotten. I remember Edwina Currie who was the social services chair in Birmingham at the time coming to Sheffield when I was social services chair there to see what we were doing on intensive fostering and it comes in waves and then goes away again and a lot of money can be wasted by avoiding the obvious which is to get people with expertise and support them in doing  On Course two, family  I have a slight disagreement with some of my colleagues -- on course two.

It is a pleasure to follow the former home secretary, who brings not only working experience but very illuminating personal experience that is relevant to several aspects of the bill and gives him an authority in what he  I want to refer briefly to the justice bill, and parts of it. The committee produced a report that has been quoted several times. On 14th December, 2012, we previously reported on the issue. We broadly welcomed the draft  which covered a wide range of private and public family law, and largely followed the recommendations. But we had significant concerns about the clause on parental involvement. I used those words because they represent a change. It was originally called Shared Parenting, a term we disapproved of because it suggests you are carving up the time in the interests of the  I will come back to that in more detail in a moment. Relationship break down is a strong topic eliciting strong views. We bought this in mind during our  In addition, we may sure to consider the proposed changes in light of other changes taking place in the family justice system. I should place on record that the Government has accepted a number of our detailed recommendations on the drafting of the bill, and I much appreciate the work of the committee's legal adviser on that subject and the that the Government has responded so readily on many of  As far as public law clause are concerned, we welcome the reduction of delay in the care  It is important there we  Last time is lost opportunity in a child's life. --  We praise the work done by some local authorities to bring down the timetable.

We fully support that principle. The adoption of the committee's recommendation to change the clauses title is welcome. But I think we would like to see what is represented by that change from sharing parenting to wider .. The Government has stated that the courts operate on the basis that both parents should be involved in a charred's life, unless it is not consistent with the child does a welfare. -- a child's life, unless it is not consistent with the child's welfare. The government have said that the purpose of the clause is not to promote the equal division of a child's time between parents. What they say is it will encourage -- encourage the resolution of agreements outside court by making clear the basis on which court decisions are made, and by ensuring that parental expectations are realistic. The government anticipates that over time the change will contribute to a societal shift towards greater recognition of the value of both parents in a child's life. I have  that is a pretty optimistic  As I indicated earlier, it would be good if that were the case. The alternative danger is that false expectations are created by the inclusion of these words, and much harm could result from that. If one looks at some of the press  the Daily Telegraph reported that the new legislation states that fathers are given the legal right to spend time to develop a meaningful relationship with their sons or daughters. The government expressly excluded bringing in the words meaningful  If an expectation has been created by press reporting, perhaps encouraged by some briefing, I think we risk disappointing many of the non-resident parents, most of them fathers, who feel that their case has not been properly considered. Can we now this misconception straight away? This is nothing to do with giving rights to parents. This is about the responsibilities of parents at the right that children should have. They have a right to have both of their parents as involved as possible. And can I suggest to him that the purpose, and why this addition to this bill, for the first time, is so important, is to send out a strong message to those resident parents to use the court system to freeze up the relationship of the non resident parent with that child, that that will no longer wash and we want to keep more cases out of the court and to be agreed the best interests of those children. That is what it  I agree with the former minister on what we are seeking to  But I think he should notice that already press coverage is suggesting something rather  which is the sharing of  As he says, it is wrong.

We urge the Government to produce proposals on enforcement. The Government has concluded that on balance it would be premature to legislate now to give courts the additional enforcement sanctions. What they hope to do is to bring cases quickly back to court preferably back to the same judge and I welcome that, I think that will be highly desirable. Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent one of the youngest constituencies in the UK with 20% of the population of my borough under 16 and between the last two  the population in heckling grew by 30,000 which included a large increase in under fives as well as young people and young parents so child care is of great importance in my constituency. We see this bill arrived and dealing with many important issues but I want to focus on childcare. The model of childcare policy is not helped by the courses in this bill -- the confusion of child care  it makes nothing clearer, it makes the confusion works. This bill repeals the local authority duty to assess child care provision and that is something that I am against because it is really important that you need to provide an accurate assessment of demand and it is a reasonable expectation that should be done locally. I am a great supporter of local authorities having that but areas perhaps unlike mine, not many young  this may fall off the edge of the local authority responsibilities. It is another example of this small state is good ideological mentality of the current government. This time on a local level and with local working parents as the victims. It does not square with the need to encourage people into work. We also see an issue with the ratios proposed. This policy is not workable it beggars belief, it does nothing to reduce the costs and if you take on generous reading, it is at the cost  If you look at what the Government are doing here, it is proposing that the adult child ratios for nurseries from what goes to one adult to three children to one in four and from one adult and four children to one adult in six children for two-year-olds and for childminders, from a 1-1 to one at  I am the second of 10 children so I am not been a problem of having young children being looked after but imagine having six toggles being taken to the park, and one of my constituents have written to me, many of my constituents are really concerned.

By did not want my baby in a nursery, I feel strongly that parents need the option of leaving children in a  caring home environment with a child minder as she speaks for so many parents up and down the country and the childminders  This moves on to the bill proposing the setting up a child minder arrangements and  It is not clear from this bowl how it will work. Among other  I am worried that the concept of an agency is different to different people. It may mean one thing to a minister and another thing to others. Is it a children's centre acting as an agent for Ofsted working likely which I could support of the right safeguards or is that the relentless march of the private sector supported by this government to turn a profit from the relationship between child minders and parents?

For all that I want to see across a cross-party approach for this, quality childcare and proper SEN provision is that the former children's  the Member for Shoreham, is correct when he talks about the children's and family agenda being downgraded by his colleague, the Education Secretary and a declining priority but the Government. I hope that is not the case and I hope this House can send a message to the Government that we care deeply about making sure this bill really delivers for parents and for the children who will be paying from my constituency the pensions of the rest of the country in years to  Let me start by saying that I think the children and families bill is a huge and hugely important piece of legislation and a tribute to the Secretary of State for but which his predecessor and two other  I think the Burl says a lot and it says a lot about the fact it is such a priority.

For pushing forward further education for disabled young people in Herefordshire. Why should a young person with special needs be treated any worse than one without? I also welcome the new duty on local authorities to set out a local offer of suitable schools institutions for is the rituals with special educational needs but I want to draw the attention of ministers to the fact that this carries with it a risk. That risk is that the new duty will be interpreted in a purely parochial way cutting out national providers of specialist expertise, in particular areas. In Hereford, the Royal National College has superb facilities for the blind and partially sighted a dedicated but to the skills of learning and of  It combines these with a track record of innovation over several decades ranging from technologies and flexible learning methods to the development of blind football and other sports at an international level. If any member of this House has not in a blind football match, I would definitely encourage them to do so. It is full of extraordinary skill. No local provider could match the Royal National College for expertise and deeper understanding of the highly complex special needs associated with visual impairment. And the students' experience bears this out. Many have arrived at having been bullied at a teaching assistant and support at a mainstream school, one student struggled to do a standard IT course because of his visual impairment and after two years he was finally referred to the Royal National College by the local JobCentre Plus and he now takes specialist IT training for the visually-impaired and his back on track to do the information- technology career he so wanted to  Enclosing, let me say that there appears to be a straightforward solution to the problem of parochial offers. This is to require local authorities to include National specialist providers as buzz regional and local ones in those local offers. This has three benefits, maximising  promoting competition and preserving the national providers' deep reservoir of skills and  It also fits this bill's distinctly Conservative emphasis on excellence and Institution building and I would ask ministers to give this bill their close consideration as it progresses. The principle that the child is paramount is enshrined in the 1989 Children's Act should underpin all policy-  I therefore welcome the strengthening of the role of the Children's Commissioner.

I would like to congratulate a former ministers on their contribution to  The Secretary of State,  and particularly the Minister on the frontbench, who has, through his manner, been impressive. Ministers have the right attitude and this is the right way to go about creating legislation. In reference to another show, I think ministers to listen to changes should not be seen as weak as a  They are stronger.
