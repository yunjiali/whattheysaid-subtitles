Issuing guidelines to frontline practitioners and providing funding to support communities to tackle FGM themselves. These actions help raise awareness, change attitudes, strengthen the legal response and support victims. Can I I thank the home Home Secretary for that answer, as she knows most of the data we use is based on a 2007 study. The Dutch Government recently issued an up to state pre-aLens. I wonder when we might look to do an up to date study in the UK. My honourable friend raises an important point. I would like to pay tribute to the work she has done on this issue and that work is respected across all parts of this House. In relation to the study issue we are currently assessing a funding application for  We did co-host the - the Home Office co-hosted with the NSPCC a round table recently at which it was discussed. We are considering various ways in which we can collect the data to inform a more targeted approach to ending this practice and indeed the Department of Health is currently exploring the collection of FGM data in the NHS, including in the maternity and children's data set. One of the best actions we can take to tackle the attitudes that lead to FGM and gender-based violence is to ensure that all of our children and young people receive age- appropriate and good quality sex and relationship education. Is this something the Secretary of State has discussed with her colleagues in the Department of Education and will the Government now support compulsory sex and relationship education?Well, the issue of education is one that is discussed in the group on violence against women and girls which I chair which meets regularly and brings Government departments acrossed  including the education  around the table. It is correct that education and information are very important aspects of dealing with FGM and I am pleased to say we have been able to deliver 40,000 leaflets and posters to schools, health services, charities and community groups raising awareness of this issue. Can I associate myself with the comments from the Home Secretary for the member for Battersea on the work she has done raising awareness  The Home Secretary will be aware of calls for action to improve awareness of FGM and to support young people facing this threat to come forward, given this and her response to the member just now can I press her about the level of violence against women and girls in Britain and to ask whether she will give her direct personal support to the one billion rising campaign and the vote in this place on Thursday to make sex and relationship education statutory for both girls and boys, yes or no? I thank the honourable lady for her commence in -- comments in relation to my honourable friend. As I said, this is an issue the Government takes extremely seriously, we do look across the board for what can be done with this issue. Helping communities themselves to eradicate this problem. We are all across this chamber concerned about the lack of prosecutions and I am pleased the DPP has issued a new action plan to the prosecutors in relation to FGM with the hope of getting prosecutions. I think what's important is that we recognise that education in a variety of sorts is what is important in relation to this issue and that is why alerting people at various levels in the public  in schools and others, and helping girls to understand the threat themselves is so important.  Mr Speaker.With pher pher permission I will answer with questions three, five and six on the order paper. Speculative projections about future inflows can't be made with any degree of accuracy and are therefore not particularly helpful, that's why the Government is focused on dealing with the abuse of free movement rights and also reducing the pool factors for migration which is why I am chairing a cross- Government group of Ministers to examine controls on migrants access to public services and benefits.  It's been estimated some 000 Romanians and Bulgarians are resident in Germany. A paper produced by the German association of citizens noted that this level of immigration creates social  Can the Minister confirm whether any lessons will be learned from the German experience? My honourable friend is right, it's helping to look at the experience of other European countries. We want to make sure when people look at the access to our benefits and our public services that no one thinks that we are a soft touch in this country and that's why the Government's taking action to make sure that won't be the case. My constituency think it's madness to open our borders to 29 million people when we have absolutely no idea how many are going to come to this country. Will the Minister at least introduce a new requirement that EU nationals seeking to reside here for more than three months have to apply for a residency card and will he insist that the Romanian and Bulgarian governments share with the Home Office any criminal records of those o who come to this country? The first point that my honourable friend makes about the residency card is something which I will listen to and take away with me. The second point, he may be interested to know that the Metropolitan Police and the UK Border Agency in an operation called Nexus have been working very closely together and have removed around 200 very serious criminals and high harm criminals and that's been very effective and something which I hope will be rolled out across the country in due course. The fact that the national minimum wage is five to six times higher in this country than it is in Bulgaria,  how confident is the Government that our public services can cope with any surge in immigration, particularly as we have got our estimates so badly wrong in 2004? I think it's worth saying that even under the whole period of the last Government when I think even by their own acknowledgement they really let far too many - they had no transitional controls for east European migration and a significant number came came here. It's worth reminding people that four fifths of net migration under the last Government was from outside the EU so it's worth seeing it in that  I go back to the answer I said in answer to my other honourable friend. The Government is looking at how our public services work, how our benefits system works to make sure we are not a soft touch and I hope that's reassuring to my honourable friend. It is of course thanks to the party opposite that the UK was the only European economy that didn't have transsignificantal controls in 2004. Can the Minister confirm that as of the 31st December every European economy will be open to the free economy will be open to the free movement of labour from Romania and Bulgaria and this time not just ours? My honourable friend makes a  It's worth remembering that eight other European countries, including France and Germany, currently have transitional controls as we do. They will have to remove those transitional controls at the end of the year. That's partly why making a forecast is so difficult. And why the migration advisory committee advised against it. The Home Office was considering putting advertisements in the Romanian and Bulgarian press advertising -- advising people not to come here. There is a way of dealing with this, first of all to work work with the governments to find out the cause of people to  Secondly, to commission research so we have proper predictions as to how many people will come here. The first part of the right honourable gentleman's question, he has been in this House long enough to know not to believe everything in newspapers. He may even occasionally have been the author of some such stories himself. But I have to say - no, I am not! Wye say in answer to the question about working with our European partners, of course we will work with the Romanian and Bulgarian governments as we do on important and serious  we work, for example, on combating terrorism, for example. We will continue to do so. We will look at ways of making sure that this country isn't a soft touch when it comes to benefits, when it comes to access to public services. The migration advisory committee advised against trying to forecast the numbers because they said it simply wouldn't be be helpful to policy-makers. Is the Minister satisfied that the fines levied on employers who don't pay the minimum wage sufficient to deter such employers from employing on the cheap the very Bulgarian and Romanian workers his honourable One of the things we are looking at is the regulation of the Labour market in general. There are many agencies involved. It is sensible to look at whether those organisations will look at -- work as closely together as they should. That is something we will be There are sometimes landlords who are cramming 20 or 30 people were in some pretty shabby housing conditions. This is a major problem and a driver of immigration, particularly from places like Romania and Bulgaria since. Will the Government now commit to introducing a statutory register of private landlords so we can drive out some of these chronic conditions question marks -- chronic conditions? For the Housing Minister and myself have accompanied UK Border Agency officials and housing officials in Ealing and on a raid to deal with exactly such landlords. It was a successful operation and we detained a number of people who have no right to be in the country. That is the kind of activity that we will continue. I am delighted that the Minister is tackling that one element that has already been referred to, but last week, the Attorney-General admitted that in 2011 at 2012, there was not a single prosecution for those breaching the national minimum wage. Would it not be a good idea if we were to impose the national minimum  and forced it properly in this country, so that unscrupulous landlords cannot force people into virtual slavery and this country.  should we not double the fine? -- in this country. I think I answered that very well. I think he needs to explain why all of these problems were singularly not dealt with during the period the party opposite was in power. They have made mistakes and have failed to  Until they do, no one will take them seriously. Can the Minister tell us if the Minister -- Government is considering taking new powers to curb benefit tourism, undertaken by Romanians and Bulgarians?

He be Government has -- the Government is supposed to be refining policing. A college has begun courses in 2012 and has already begun training the next generation of police leaders.What the new college now in place, .. The College of policing seems to have more time for having  So most of OD business area work has been integrated into the College of policing and I paid tribute to the college for its work. It is a private and limited country that is not owned or controlled by the Home Office. It determines its own future as a company. Home Office has granted funding to the headquarters, but that ceased at the end of 2012, when the college was established. Undercover police in is extremely important. Does the Minister think that this can be improved by an investigation into the allegations that have been made on the dead children in London being used as passports for a police undercover names, and would he agree that standards and improvements in undercover training are one of the key elements of the College of policing?

I have checked that those assurances are being met personally, and I am able to reassure him that they are. As he will know, my Right Honourable Friend the Home Secretary has promised that the resources will be made to the IPCC so they can conduct this investigation as burly -- as thoroughly as the victims of the disaster deserve.The air is a real concern that the IPCC is having -- there is a real concern that the IPCC is having to deal with a huge number of complaints, some of which are relatively  What mechanism will be put in place to make sure it that the IPCC can focus its resources on important cases, such as the one that has been raced today? -- that has been raised today?

I don't accept that there is more bureaucracy that is preventing CCTV cameras being  Under the previous  there was in essence, a centralised control mechanism that was put in place tpwu didn't actually assess whether the CCTV systems that were put in place were effective and were cutting crime.

CCTV provides - it leads to people changing their plea from not guilty  It saves the police time  It saves the courts time  It brings criminals to  It actually proves people's innocence. The Government should be doing everything it can to roll out CCTV as far as possible. It's not doing so. Why is it not wanting to roll it out to more local communities? I say to my honourable friend that the Government supports the use of CCTV and that it can be a very important way of bringing crimes to  What I would say is that he may wish to speak to his police and crime commissioner who will hold a community safety budget and may wish to apply part of that in support of new CCTV projects. The honourable member for Islington South and Finsbury - it's a triumph of optimism over reality. Medway council is being developed at a regional CCTV hub helping prevent crime and saving other councils  What is the Minister's policy on encouraging the development of CCTV hubs? Well, I very much recognise the point my honourable friend has highlighted. I recognise equally the way in which it is possible to pool together resources and systems to make systems more eeffective. It's those approaches we are seeking to advance through the code. I am sure the commission will also be examining his very point. Number 12,  On 27th November, Mr  the Government published its ending gang and youth violence report one year on, setting out achievements and further commitments. Over the past year practical support has been provided to 29 local areas, support for four more areas was announced in December. I thank you for that answer. My constituent has long campaigned against gang violence after tragically losing her son in an unprovoked attack and she spent considerable time with young people warning them of the consequences involved in gangs. What action is his department taking to improve such intervention in our schools to tackle gang violence? I give my sincere commissionerations to Lauren Fraser t must have been extremely harrowing ordeal for her and it reminds me of a case in my constituency shortly after I was elected in 2005 when a young man called Lloyd Foyaeupbger was murdered and his brother Adam was energetic in promoting safety among young people in schools and elsewhere and I commend the work of his constituent and mine and our work on ending gang and youth violence does include elements of programmes within schools and I commend that type of work across Just a few weeks ago in my constituency in Salford there was a horrific incident when a totally innocent shopkeeper was attacked by an individual wielding a nine inch kitchen knife. It transpired that this person had mental health problems. My Chief Constable tells me that violence is increasingly perpetrated by people with mental health problems. What is the Minister doing with his colleagues in the Department of Health to tackle this tkaeupbg increase tore people in -- danger to people in our communities? I am  Mr Speaker, to hear about that appalling case. I again pass my commissionerations to everybody involved. We do try across Government with the dement of health in this case to try to make sure Government policy is effective at combining different elements of reducing criminality. I don't say it's any any consolation to the family in this case, tpwu may help the House to know that in the year to June 2012 overall in the crime survey for England and Wales there was a reduction of 14% in homicides, 9% reduction in violent incidents involving knives or sharp instruments and 18% reduction in gun crime. If you are a victim of crime that isn't much consolation to you but overall violent crime in this country is  Number 13, Mr Speaker.  we aim to process all applications promptly.

There is a view amongst many people that referring to a policy guidance is a euphemism for disappearing into a big black hole. I am particularly concerned about the issue of spouses applications for residents cards which have particularly long period of time before they are  Really what I am asking is what checks are in place to ensure that the cases are not neglected and are not allowed to run on for an inor dinate amount of time?

If he has any particular cases where for whatever reason they need to be dealt with urgently, I suggest he writes to me and I will see what I can do to exwe exwedite them. The Government has published a  This includes the community trigger which will give people the power to make agencies take persistent problems seriously. The community recommend di, which will give victims a say. And faster more effective powers to enable frontline professionals to better protect the public. Much of the antisocial behaviour experienced by my constituents in Norwich is associated with excess alcohol consumption. Can I urge the Government to end the supply of pocket money-prized alcohol in result to its recent consultation. My honourable friend is right to remind the House that in October early morning restriction orders were introduced by the Government as well as a provision to charge a late night levy, part of a package of measures to deal with concerns that have been brought to our attention about alcohol licensing and alcohol consumption. He will also know that the consultation onen minimum unite pricing and other measures finished last week and we will consider properly the the representations we have received an make an announcement in due course. Under the Government's new policy on antisocial behaviour people will have to complain three times. Can he tell me why people should have to wait so long before receiving help? This is frustration for me, Mr  because we have explained this so pain-stakingly and carefully and the concept is so  Let me have one more go. We want every council - every council in the country and other relevant agencies to respond straightaway, whenever problems are brought to their attention. But it has been brought to our attention, including under a lot of Labour councils, that people keep bringing  particularly lower level complaints about individual incidents that may in themselves not always warrant immediate  What we want to do is make sure there is some measure of calm calmlative impact and that's why we have put this measure in place and people are running with it and Wye commend it to councils around the country, including Labour-run councils. In 2011-12 the police detected more 000 offences of violence against the person, this represents a detection rate of 46.4%, up from 7% in 2009-10. I thank the  My statistics suggest police officer numbers are running at their lowest level in a decade and there there was 7,000 fewer crimes of violence against the person solved in the last year. Can the Minister not understand the  isn't it time to stop and reverse the police cuts? Let me - I took the trouble to look up the figures for Bedfordshire in terms  because I know it will be of interest to the honourable  He can tell the House how he sees the coralation. Recorded crime is falling in  comparing figures for the 20 months to September 2012 with the core responding 12 months  shows in Bedfordshire, the reduction in total crime was  in just one year, and violence against the person was down 15%, that seems to be a record the Government should be pleased about while not being complacent and trying to drive crime even further down. Official figures show that 30,000 fewer sraoeupls were solved last  The first time this has fallen in over a decade. With fewer criminals being caught, and  does the Minister think that the 11,500 fewer police officers on the frontline has anything to do with this? There twor things that make Labour MPs look really glum, Mr Speaker. One of them is unemployment falling. And the other is crime falling. I would say to any party, if your interests are so directly in conflict with the interests of the people you purport to serve, then you have got political problems. What's happening in this country is that in the most recent figures, crime survey for England and Wales shows that 8% fall in crime, the recorded crime statistics are down  It's because we have got crime down to the lowest point since records began in 1981 that there are fewer crimes to detect. I hope we will carry on getting crime down even further. Number 16, Mr Speaker. In the last quarterly report on the exercise of powers in the terrorist prevention and organisation measures act 2011 for the reporting period first September to 13 November 2012, ten people were subject to a notice during this time. Kfrpblgts the Minister tell us exactly at that time was he under surveillance or was he not under surveillance? Just a yes or no, nothing technical. I say to the honourable gentleman the operation to locate him is still ongoing and the police are doing everything in their power to locate and identify this individual. What I say to the honourable gentleman is perhaps where we would agree, that the best place to see a terrorist is in  But - and that is precisely why the Government has committed additional resources to supplement the regime and to ensure that there is that balance of preventive, as well as ensuring people are brought  Lord Carlile recently confirmed that no individual absconded while subject to a relocation order. Isn't the fact that this man did not abscond when he was relocated but when back to  clear evidence that the decision to remove the relocation powers was a very serious mistake. Will he look again at that decision? I don't accept the point that the right honourable gentleman has made and indeed the Metropolitan Police commissioner in evidence to the home affairs Select Committee did not say that you could draw the parallel that the right honourable gentleman is seeking to make. Clearly we are reviewing this incident closely and if there are, as we - if there are practical issues that need to be adopted we will consider and adopt them. Question 18, Mr Speaker.  The UK works closely with partners in source countries to disrupt organised human trafficking gangs. We work very hard to do so, both to apprehend criminals in those countries and also vote in the -- those in the United Kingdom.What assessment has my honourable friend made of section 14 of the crime and disorder - police disorder act 2009 in terms of protecting the victims of trafficking of the UK domestic Prost cushion market -- Prost tuition mark -- prostitution market. That was raised in a debate in Westminster Hall. My friend may be interested to know that this afternoon I will be meeting with officers of the all-party group, including my honourable friend for Wellingborough and Baroness Butler- sloess and I hope we can have discussions in due course. Does the Minister believe sentences delivered to courts are - to stop agents misleading and forcing women into harsh domestic Labour and the People are not and this has rarely prosecuted for traffic offences when other offences are more easily  -- people are not often  He operational activity is already taking place within the National crime agency, building on previous work, and I am pleased to say that the policing command is particularly doing work to  My constituents are hearing shocking allegations of sexual exploitation.

We all agree that childhood sexual exploitation is a form of abuse, and I know that the police are committed to tick -- tackling this crime in all its  There is increasing attention that the police is paying to this issue and work is being carried out to co-ordinate a response in an action plan that will include the child and exploitation unit that works with the internet. The have recently been several news reports alleging misconduct by the police's special demonstration squad. That squad is being investigated under the supervision of the independent police complaints commission, and given the seriousness of the latest allegations, the Metropolitan Police commissioner and the chairman of the IPCC have agreed that it would be appropriate for a senior figure from outside the Metropolitan Police to take over the leadership of the investigation. The Chief Constable of the Derbyshire police has agreed to take on the role and he brings many years of experience as a detective and he has led many major investigations, including police corruption cases. The investigation will be under the direction and control under the Constable, but it will remain under the supervision of the IPCC, who will provide  Can my Honourable Friend say what steps her party is taking -- taking in reference to extradition? It is in hour public interest that we have a sound extradition arrangements and that they function properly. The public need to have confidence and those arrangements. It is vital that the decisions are not only fair but are seen to be fair. A forearm ba is being introduced that will make these cases are more transparent. Can I welcome the announcement on undercover policing. I know the whole House will send its sympathy to the family of the woman who took her own life after giving evidence against her abusers in court. She was let down by the criminal justice system whose job it was to protect and help her. It is a merger that Greater Manchester police supported the woman in getting counselling while Surrey police did not. The salary -- Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner has said that it is the responsibility of the police to give evidence in a way that is untainted and that the victim of -- and that they will not refer a bid from to counselling and after that they give their evidence. -- a victim to counselling. Does the Minister agree that all police forces need to make sure that counselling is available and will she ensure that a proper review takes place into the handling of this entire case so that lessons can be learned from this dreadful tragedy? I say to the Right Honourable Lady that I am sure everybody across this House will send their condolences to the family of the lady concerned. This was a terrible case when you look at the details, and we all have this sympathies with the family and what they have gone through. I also say to her that obviously this whole question of how the police deal with rape cases is one that has the look at. We are trying to improve the way the police look at  We all recognise that one of the issues here is the difficulty that speeds victims feel in coming  Sadly, fresh rubber that the victims feel in coming forward. -- that the victims feel in coming  Sadly, this can put victims off from coming forward. We hope that victims will too confident in coming forward. It I  the concern -- I welcome the  The first thing that needs to be done is to tell the forces that they need to make sure that counselling can be made -- given in these cases. One rubble or intimidated witnesses should not be denied the -- will rubble or intimated bonuses should not be denied counselling. This did not happen in this case and the Surrey police and Crime Commissioner is saying the opposite. Will she give it very clear instructions across the country that cancelling must be made available in line with guidelines and that's a proper review will take place in all aspects of this case so that we can learn lessons from this terrible tragedy and that vulnerable victims can make sure that they get the help and support that was denied to this woman? As I indicated, we will look to see what lessons can be learned from this particular case. The Right Honourable Lady will be aware that the Home Secretary does not instruct police forces to take particular routes. They have operational independence in decisions as to how they deal with particular cases. What is important is that the guidance is there and that police forces are aware of that guidance and that they look to operate within that guidance. I will reflect on the remarks that she has made in relation to the attention that is being given on that particular guidance, but I am sure that all of us across the House want to ensure that we have a system that ensures rape victims feel able to come forward and that we see more prosecutions taking  Will my Honourable Friend agree with me that there is no contradiction and having an immigration system which is robust with an efficient visa system was that the same time having an economy that is open for business? My Honourable Friend puts it extremely well. There is no contradiction between having an efficient visa system which enables us to operate our appropriate immigration policies and having the brightest and best come here. There is no contradiction in doing that. It is what this government is doing.  and mephedrone offences have a increase significantly in Wales since 2011. More girls are using it than any drug in the past and dealing is more open than ever  What will be done to tackle the supply of this very dangerous drug? I am extremely sorry to hear about the experiences and the Honourable Gentleman's constituency. Drug consumption in England and Wales is falling. There is lots of statistical evidence that will point to that direction. There are differing threats and some particular drugs are not falling in line with other types of drugs. I will happily meet with him to see what more we can do to improve the situation in his constituency.What overall progress is the Home Secretary making in terms of reducing net migration into the UK down to a more sustainable level? I am very pleased to tell my Honourable Friend at the last set of statistics saw a fall of a quarter in net migration and we are on track to reduce it from the unsustainable hundreds of thousands that it was what the party opposite to a much more sustainable tens of The reality of the government cuts are that local councils are switching off CCTV cameras and closing local and high social behaviour offices. Local housing companies are not able to get rid of problem tenants and police stations are closing and snigger at police think is becoming more remote. Is the -- and neighbourhood policing is becoming  What is she going to do about it? In reference to CCTV, as I have already established, this is not the case. I am surprised that he is not seeking to welcome the cuts in crime in his own constituency, and the fact that this Government is taking the tough decisions at a difficult time to ensure that we get the right before and to establish Police and Crime Commissioner as to make a communities safer. The excellent work done by the freedom programme for female victims of domestic  And my constituency, we all are keen to focus on male victims as well. Will the Minister join me in endorsing this and ever and indicate what resources will be available? Approximately one 5th of the victims of domestic violence  and most of these services, because the majority of victims are  most of the services are admired -- designed to help female victims of domestic violence. That seems to be an entirely commendable and purchase form of service and I congratulate what is happening in his constituency and I hope it can be applied more widely. The Honourable Member for Taunton has come to this session armed with some excellent answers, unfortunately, not relevant to the questions he is being asked. This was it a question we were asking him is that he stood for election and at the same time 30,000 fewer crimes are being sold. Does he still recognise that there is a link between the few workplace and fewer crimes being solved? Maybe I can -- fewer crimes and -- fewer police and fewer crimes being solved? We now have the lowest reported crime in England and Wales since a survey began 32 years ago. I am very proud of that record and I am surprised that the Honourable Gentleman does not share my pride. Migration what have a good track record in these matters. Can we have the early his announcement of concrete results of the ministerial forecast? I do not think engaging in broadcasts is helpful. I am looking had access to public service and benefits to make sure that we are not a soft touch and I am sure that my Honourable Friend will support us in that work. We have seen some great corporation between the UK and the European Union on crime and justice to the European arrest warrant. Could I encourage the Government not to oppose the arrest warrant and the government could take a responsible attitude to this issue.We are looking at all of the measures that fall under the so-called 2014 opt  It is the current intention of the Government to opt out of those measures and opt out to the ones we think are in the interests of the British public. There are cases which are known to members of this House where people have been held for lengthy periods of time in detention before trials and the proportionality issue is one that worries not just the UK but other member states as well. Can my Honourable Friend tell me what success there has been in cutting Hampshire Police. There was a fall in numbers.The dampening mechanism that's been applied to Bedfordshire under successive governments have threft with �22 million less than it should have had. When the Home Secretary met new Police and Crime Commissioner candidates and Commissioners earlier this month, she said that mechanism would be reviewed but it's become clear it won't be until after the next general election. For mow much longer will Bedfordshire have to fight urban levels of crime with rural levels of funding? I am also happy to tell the honourable gentleman that for bed Bedfordshire recorded crime is down 12% in the year to September. Wye hope he would welcome that. As he says, this Government has continued the mechanism that was put in place by the previous Government in 2006. We are having a review of it. One of the reasons why the review needs to be thorough is precisely so we can involve the newly elected police and crime commissioners, including the one in Bedfordshire, so that they can make a full contribution to the debate to make sure we have better mechanisms in future. Does the Home Secretary share my concern that the very small number of those convicted in the summer 2011 riots who are foreigners - how few have been deported so far and what's going to be done about it? My honourable friend might be interested to know we are actually actively pursuing deportation in 150 of those cases and have successfully removed 15 of those The Government will continue to do so and I am confident that the vast majority of foreign national offenders involved in these riots will be removed from the country once their sentences are complete.The inquiry which the Home Secretary has announced, about undercover agents, wouldn't it be appropriate at this stage, at least, to give an apology from the Home Secretary herself to the parents of the children, the dead children, whose names were taken for undercover policing? What happened was absolutely disgraceful. Such an  I believe, is absolutely appropriate. The honourable gentleman makes the point that if these cases are indeed - if this is the case it is absolutely disgraceful this has  The investigation is still ongoing to establish the facts in relation to this and it's important that we say anything we wish to say in relation to the facts that have taken place following that investigation.  the Prime Minister. Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am sure the whole House will join me in in in sending our best wishes to Pope Benedict following his announcement today. He's worked tirelessly to strengthen Britain's relations with the Holy See and his visit to Britain in 2010 is remembered with great respect and affection. Pope Benedict's message on that visit of working for the common good is something that spoke to our whole country and I am sure his successor will continue to provide a voice of inspiration for millions around the world.  last week's European Council agreed the overall limit on EU spending for the next seven years starting in 2014. When these multi-year deals have been agreed in the past spending has gone up, but last week we agreed that spending should come down. By working with like-minded allies we delivered a real terms cut. Mr  as the House knows, the EU budget is negotiated annually. So what we were negotiating initially at the Council last November and last week was not the individual annual budgets, but rather the overall framework for the next seven years. This includes the overall ceilings on what can be  Effectively, the limit on the European Union's credit card for the next seven years. Mr  during the last negotiation, which covered the period 2007 to 2013, the last Government agreed to an increase in the payment ceiling of 8% to 943 billion euros. Put simply, this gave the EU a credit card with a higher limit and today we are still living with the results of allowing the EU's big spenders to push for more and more spending each year.  only last year while member states were having to make tough decisions to tighten their belts at home, the big spenders succeeded in increasing the 2012 European budget by another 5% compared with the previous year. If no deal had been reached, the existing ceilings would have been rolled over and annual budgets could have continued to soar for the next seven years. Because annual budgets are negotiated by qualified majority voting, it can be difficult to constrain spending in these annual negotiations.  the seven-year limits are agreed by unanimity so this was our chance to get the ceilings down with what can could be afforded. The European Commission produced an initial proposal for increasing the payment ceiling still further to 988 billion euros. This was strongly supported by a number of member states. The first negotiation took place at the Council in November. Although the President did then reduce this during the Council itself, it was still some way short of the real terms cut we were looking for. Together with like-minded allies from a number of countries, including Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, we rejected the deal on the table and told them to think again. At this Council we made further progress, together with allies many like Britain who write the cheques, we looked across all the areas where spending could be cut. While there are areas where we could and should  not least on reforming  and reducing the bureaucratic costs of the European  we agreed a real terms cut in the payment limit to 908 billion euros. Mr Speaker, that is 80 billion lower than the original  It is 35 billion lower than the deal agreed by the last Government which is still in operation today. It is 60 billion lower than the emergency arrangements which would have come into place if there was no seven-  But my aim was not simply to cut the credit card limit, I wanted to set the limit at a level that would deliver at worst a  and at best a cut in the annual spending over the next seven  And that is what this deal  a real terms cut. If you take the latest complete budget, the one for 2012, and freeze spending at that level for the next seven years, you would have spending limits of 932 billion  Our new payments limit means spending cannot rise above 908  So we have slashed 24 billion off a real freeze on the last completed budget. Now of course the budget set in 2012 which Britain voted against was unacceptably large. But even against the average of the last two completed years, 2011 and 2012, this deal still delivers a real  Now of course this deal must now be voted on by the European Parliament. The European Council has said it is prepared to accept some flexibilities about how spending is divided between different budget years and different areas of spending. But we are absolutely clear this must be within the framework that the member states have now agreed. The EU's seven-year budget will now cost less than 1% of Europe's gross national income for the first time in its history. Mr Speaker, lit me say -- let me say a word about how this deal is likely to affect the UK's contribution, a word about how it's like throeu affect what the UK receives from the EU for research,  farmers and a word about what this means for growth and competitiveness across the European  as a whole. On the UK's contribution, the House will remember how the last Government gave away almost half of our rebate. This has had a long-term and continuing effect on the UK's net contributions and it's worth remembering why. Because when the European Union spends money on, for  structural funds and cohesion payments in east European  the UK no longer gets a rebate on this money. As a result, almost whatever budget deal was done our net contributions p always likely to go up but as a result of this deal they'll be going up by  The only two sensible things we could do to protect the British taxpayer in these negotiations were to get the overall budget down and to protect what is level of -- left of our rebate. He was the one who gave away - you keep saying... Even he is welcome on a happy day like  That is exactly what we have  While the actual amount that the UK contributes will depend on technical factors like the size of the annual budgets, economic performance and exchange rates, as a result of this deal we now expect the UK's contribution to the EU to fall as a share of our gross national income. As for the rebate this Government inherited, it is now completely untouched. As ever, throughout these negotiations the rebate was attacked repeatedly but I successfully rejected all the calls for change and under this Government the British rebate is  In terms of what the UK  I wanted to make sure our universities, are well placed to receive research work, our less well-off regions are treated fairly and farmers continue to receive support for environment schemes put  On these points the section of the budget that includes spending on research, innovation and university funding is actually up by a third. This money is handed out on the basis of quality, so Britain's universities are particularly well placed to benefit. We have ensured that structural funds will continue to flow to less well-off regions and Britain's share will remain broadly the same at around 11 billionures. While we have cut spending on the common agricultural policy overall, we have protected the flexibility which will allow us to direct funds to support both the environment and the livelihoods of our farming communities. Overall, this is a better framed budget in terms of  jobs and competitiveness. It is disappointing that administerive costs are still around 6% of the total. But overall spending on the CAP will fall by 13% compared with the last budget. Research and development and other other pro-growth investment will count for 13% rather than 9%. Reform of EU spending is a long- term project. But this deal does deliver important progress. Working with allies we took real steps towards reform in the European  It is a good deal for  A good deal for Europe.  a good deal for all our  that's what we have delivered and I commend this to the  Mr Miliband.

His decision to stand down won't have been reached lightly and it is right that on all sides of this House we acknowledge his service. I join the Prime Minister in welcoming the budget agreement that's been reached, on a cut in the seven-year payment ceilingss for the budget, at a time when so many budgets are being cut at home this House voted for a real terms cut last October. It was right to  Mr Speaker. No doubt it was just an oversight that in his statement he forgot to express his thanks to members on his own side and this for giving him such a strong negotiating mandate.

Can the Prime Minister confirm that the achievement of a declining budget compared to last November's proposal came not at the expense of agriculture spending, but in part at the expense of this funding for growth? Third, he and I agree on the need for the EU to play its part in effective development, diplomatic and Government support in North Africa. Can he say what discussions took place about how the EU can play this enhanced role in the context of the decision in this budget round to effectively freeze a European development fund which provides assistance to that  Given the new emerging challenges across this, what information can the Prime Minister provide on how funding to that region will be affected. In that  because it was part of the Council conclusions, can the Prime Minister take the opportunity to say something about the transition roadmap for Mali, which was at least part of the discussions. Given the significant and unprecedented difference between the ceiling on payments which the Prime Minister talked about in his  and the ceiling on commitments agreed on Friday, can he tell the House what discussions took place about how this will be dealt with in the years ahead? Mr  while this budget brings  Europe still needs a plan for recovery and growth. The council conclusions talk about importance of trade agreements. Can the Prime Minister update the House on developments to possible EU-US trade agreement and how he sees this being developed this year, including at the G8 summit. Does he also recognise the long-term changes to the budget and the possible EU-US trade agreement are not a substitute for a growth One million young people are looking for work in the UK. The EU economy is struggling and the UK economy is flat lining. Britain now needs a plan for jobs and growth. That is the change we need for Britain and that must be the priority for the months and years ahead. SPEAKER: I suppose we should take We should take it from someone who never got a freeze but a cut. From someone who said we would be marginalised, isolated and picking fights in an empty room. I welcome that the welcome. Thank you for  He asked a lot of questions. On agriculture, is there more to do in terms of reducing his Budget, given it is only 1% of European industry? Yes there is. We have made some steps forward. The cap budget goes from 320 billion to 277, it is significant. In terms of what grew in the Budget in what can help growth and jobs, the connecting Europe facility about energy, transport and broadband. It goes from 8 billion to 19 billion in this period. It is not entirely fair to say the right things were not increase and the right things were not cut. I said in my statement we did not go further on the central bureaucracy. We did have a discussion on North Africa  He is wrong to say the European Development Fund goes down, it goes up by a billion. On the issue of Mali, there was very little time left to discuss these  but I took the opportunity to praise the French President's the the action the French have taken and offer our support. To say we would be contributing by training troops from West African  I spoke to a Nigerian President in London about that issues will stock on the gap between ceilings and payments, the gap is between 960 on commitments 4 on payments.

On the issue of how we use the European Union to encourage growth, one of the greatest things we can do is complete the single market in  energy and services and it is this Government working with allies that is delivering precisely  In terms of this deal over  I do think now there is a real need to make sure the European Parliament supports it. Often we are challenged about what friends we have in Europe, I would challenge him about his friends. What is he going to say to his friends in the European Socialist Party who are condemning this deal, condemning the Bee Gees actions saying we shouldn't be constraining European standing. Can he confirm that Labour MEPs will be voting for this Budget? Answer? They heard moved a little bit. While the is at  isn't it time to confirm or whether the party opposite will back and in out referendum or not. They claimed the greatest problem is uncertainty. What can be more uncertain than not knowing whether you are for it or against it? Not a day for answers, but a day to celebrate the fact we have cut the budget for the first time in The Prime Minister has been successful in winning the most important reform in the EU budget since Margaret Thatcher in 1983. Does my right honourable friend agree that his achievements and the success also last week in the most acceptable reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, demonstrates how many of United Kingdom's objectives can be achieved by serious and professional talks, along with our allies? Does he accept also that our objectives for the working-time directives can be achieved, as he did with the EU budget and as the United Kingdom did it with the CFP, by working with close allies whom we have on so many of these subjects? I agree with my right honourable friend. It is worth paying tribute to Baroness Thatcher, because the fact about the British rebate and what makes it different to the other rebates, is it does not have to be renewed in each seven-year term, it is there as part of the Architecture of the  Unless you are foolish enough to give some of it away, like the last Government did, it can only be amended by unanimity. I would also say this, and it is relevant to what Margaret Thatcher  everyone in the European Union has got to understand you are prepared to say no, if you do not get what you want. In welcoming the progress that was made, could I ask the Prime Minister about further efforts to be made to cut administrative cuts -- costs of the European Union. In Germany the high cost of salaries and the benefits which those officials are enjoying is now a matter of public controversy. Could the Prime Minister say what progress he thinks could be made within his budget to make sure those who work for the European Commission are paid a reasonable salary but not one that offends European taxpayers? He is right to raise  The proposal by the Commission for what is called heading five, �63 billion over the seven-year period, it was cut back 6 million. If you look at levels of pay, if you look at levels of benefit, if you look at some of the special payments people  there is a range of reforms that could be made. We could go on arguing for them and working with allies. It is understood across Europe but there are generosity is that are not  I congratulate the Prime Minister on a very successful outcome from the talks. Will he take this opportunity to ask all party political leaders in this country to urge their their MEPs to a poll this deal and to vote for it in the European Parliament sir? And sure Conservatives will, but the public wouldn't take kindly to being let down by MEPs after he has done so well. My right honourable friend makes an important -- important point. The MEPs that do can for a decent percentage of the European Parliament. He makes a difference of socialist MEPs from Britain votes for this Budget and also they should do so in an open, transparent manner. The fact you have a secret ballot in a Parliament seems wrong to. The fact is you send MEPs to Brussels and Strasbourg so you can see what they do on your behalf.Would the Prime Minister confirmed the entire EU budget accounts for just 1%, just 1% of the gross national income of all 27 European member states? Shouldn't his real priority be to end of a disastrous policy of austerity that he and his fellow leaders are imposing rise across  and kick-start growth and investment to bring hope and prosperity instead of despair and stagnation? I am afraid it is this  a little bit of billions  a little bit of billions  does not matter very much. It is the attitude that got us into so much trouble. Yes it is 1% for the first time, it is 1% of Europe's g n I, but it is many of billions of pounds repaid in two the European Union and it is important we keep the budget under  Can I congratulate the Prime Minister on the outcome and tell him that both my colleagues here and members of the European Parliament are supportive of the  in terms of the size of the budgets. Given that the deal achieved with like-minded partners protected areas like police co-  can the Prime Minister join me in saying to people like the leader of UK macro, that you shouldn't have Bulgarians and Romanians flooding our shores, but not have a European arrest warrant and a range was like it that gives European police co-operation? I welcome the commitment by the Liberal Democrat to support this  We have two dank, we have the Liberals up for it, we have the Conservatives up for it. What are you going to do when you hear people tell you it is a terrible deal, when will we see some leadership from the opposition? I would also make the point it is also important we do have a structure and cohesion funds that help countries that are recovering from decades of communism to raise their living  We should support the European Union in that way.What discussions took place about the justice and home affairs agenda? 000 people crossed illegally from Turkey into Greece.

It is an area where there are new responsibilities, not least because of the new member states and that is why that heading is going up. Out like to congratulate my right honourable friend, in demonstrating that when a British leader takes irresolute and reasons constructive approach on what is good for Britain and Europe, we can succeed in carrying other people with us. Disproving the Craven prediction of the leader opposite, that by articulating Britain's distinctive vision for the future of Europe, we would undermine our influence.

A behalf of my constituents, I congratulate the Prime Minister in getting his overall reduction in the budgets for the United Kingdom.

Having carried this through in line with the most important of his five Bloomberg  at the root of our democracy and accountability lies in this Parliament, which voted for such reduction, does this not bruise the UK national interest is best served when governments and parliaments are at one? A I agreed with my honourable friend. One of the point that had to be made quite a lot in the council, is a lot of leaders of European countries kept referring to what they thought the European Parliament would do if we agreed that figure all this figure. The point had to be made that we  more importantly, be listening to the individual, national parliaments. It is our parliaments that have two votes of  The European Parliament has not have any responsibility for voting for money. Mr Speaker, I am sure the Prime Minister is right to say no deal would be damaging for Europe and Britain. Could he say something about the part of this statement which referred to a new power for the European Parliament to talk flexibilities over years. Also over budget heads. On one reading it is a sensible bit of  but on the other it is a chance of what has been read Having said that, given that we have to try and make sure there is  and it's better to have a deal than no deal, I think it's right to say to the parliament it is important you can look at flexibilities between different  between different budget headings to try and make sure that spending is planned properly, but I was very specific and it was very specifically said at the Council that this flexibility cannot result in the 908 billion ceiling being  You can move money around to plan spending more  of course, though, all of that has to come back to the Council to be agreed but the 908.4 in my point is inviable. At a time when the democratic link between the EU and the people of the EU is  would he agree any attempt by the European Parliament to ratify this by a secret ballot should and would be treated with contempt?The idea of a secret ballot in a parliament is extraordinary concept. MPs and MEPs should vote transparently so their constituents can hold them to account and it's very important that - they have to account not only to their electorates, but also to the whole countries which will suffer if a deal isn't passed through. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his Government is still in favour of future enlargement of the European Union beyond Croatia to countries in the Western Balkans and potentially elsewhere and given this budget lasts until 2020, what provision is there in the budget for any further accessions of new states after Croatia? We are in favour of further expansion of the European Union to the countries of the Western Balkans and others as he says. There is room in the budget for cohesion and other payments, but there is not - the fixed amount of payment ceiling, 908.4, that can't  Can I add my congratulations to my right honourable friend from returning from Europe with a very good deal for the United Kingdom. Part of the ongoing long-term reductions in staff of the European institutions has been something that has been close to my right honourable friend's heart. Could he tell me if he expects to now see a reduction in those staff as well as a return to perhaps less generous remuneration and retirement packagess that EU officials currently enjoy? I can reassure my honourable friend I was not winsing at anything she said. I share her view - that's for me to know and you to find out! I agree with her we need to make more progress on  It's disappointing how far we have come on this. I think there is a sense in Brussels that somehow their officials are sort of higher beings and they even referred to civil servants elsewhere as burger-  compared to the lofty  I think that really needs to be beaten down and we need to recognise that actually their civil servants have got to live within proper budgets just as ours have to. I have to tell the Prime Minister that my predecessor apparently left that piece of paper behind in  Cyprus, were there any discussions on the proposed bail out for Cyprus and in particular suggestion that uninsured deposits in Cypriot banks would be written down as losses which would have considerable effect for people here? There was a brief discussion about  not least because the President was attending his last European Council and Herman Van Rompuy gave him a moving eulogy and described him as everyone's favourite communist which received widespread assent. There wasn't an indepth discussion about the Cypriot discussion. I support the Prime Minister's statement. I am sure no horsemeat was on the menu  but can he reassure us that europoll's budget will be protected in this multiannual  given its recent success identifying 103 people smuggling suspects and 425 people imfully indicated -- implicated in football-match-fixing and tackling crime involved in horsemeat scandal. What I can say to my honourable friend is if he looks at the heading three, which is the money spent on home affairs, justice and europol issues that is going from 4 to 15.7 billion. Wye join him in saying that the horsemeat issue is extremely serious. As my right honourable friend, the agriculture Secretary said, this is predominantly an issue about food  food labelling and truthful telling to consumers. But we really do need to do everything we can to get on top of this? The Prime Minister - as a sign of his good spwepgses will he guarantee to make up in full any shortfall in cohesion funding in west Wales and the valley? What I can say to the honourable gentleman is overall the amount of structural funds that coming to the United Kingdom at around 11 billion, it's a small reduction but broadly  maybe 2% less. We then have to decide how that money is fairly divided up between the different regions. Of course west Wales is one of the less developed regions and so should benefit from that but we will be making final determinations about how the money is divided up when we know more about the overall figures and it's been passed by the European Parliament. May I congratulate the Prime Minister on being more sceptical than the sceptics and delivering an even better deal than the cash freeze some of us voted for in public last autumn. But may I just say to him that on the day that Pope Benedict has announced his  surely some people in Europe will come to realise the ideal of - of Europe lies in Western civilisation, not a bunch of MEPs voting in secret to preserve their perks and pay? My honourable friend is entirely  a secret ballot would be  We need an open ballot. I would encourage every MEP from right across the United Kingdom, whatever their party, to support this budget because it's better to have a deal than to have no deal. This deal is right for Europe's taxpayers. During the summit the Prime Minister clearly had talks with President Hollande about the situation in Mali, but strangely he's made no statement to the House of Commons on this. Could he tell us how long the French troops intend to be there, how many more British troops are going, and what is the cost of them and what, above  is the military objective of the British participation in this enterprise? There was a brief discussion about Mali which President Hollande led and I did have a discussion with him. I strongly support what the French  I don't believe it is the French intention to keep their troops there a moment longer than they have to. The intention is to train up African forces from the West African states. Britain is prepared to contribute some 200 troops to that purpose. I spoke this morning to the President of Nigeria to offer our support to training Nigerian troops and it's our intention and the French's intention that those West African troops will replace the French  Then what needs to happen is two things - a political agreement in Mali that helps to bring that country together, but also the rapidied training of Malian forces so they can take responsibility for their own  No one wants foreign troops to stay in Mali a second longer than is necessary and that's certainly not our intention. The Prime Minister has achieved two incredible firsts recently, not just the rolling back of the multiannual financial framework, but also the double majority lock for European banking union voting. Does he believe that this means that austerity has led to a new Realism in the European Union? Does he think that the support he's gained for his reforms recently will lead to a greater acceptance of the need for reform and repatriation in achieving a new settlement for Britain as a member of the EU? I thank the honourable lady for what she says. There are two things  First is there is a growing sense right across Europe, not just in the UK, that we have to have proper control of EU spending and if you are tightening your belt at home you shouldn't be spending more through the EU, that had strong support. Second thing is countries are seeing that as the euro requires a further tightening of parts of the European Union, there need to be proper arrangements put in place for non- euro countries and the banking union agreement was a good example of that and I hope that's the precursor to more such arrangements like that which will be helpful for non-euro countries like Britain. A few members on both sides of the House have been generous to the Prime Minister this afternoon. Will he resip preu indicate and congrat late his own backbenchers and the opposition for giving him a strong negotiating mandate? This incredible foresight? I would like to argue it was all part of a plan and perhaps on a day like this I will just leave it at that. May I congratulate the Prime Minister on a hugely impressive' chiefment which -- achievement which saves every household �150. Will he confirm as well as the new ceilings being well below the old ceilings, even more impressively, they're below the 2011-12 actual payments and as well as gross contributions being lower under this deal, it is conceivable that despite the Labour rebate giveaway that even net kbgs -- contributions will come down. I am grateful for what he says. On the net contributions, I think it is difficult to foresee net contributions coming down, because it wouldn't be right to keep trying to spend more on agriculture where we do get a rebate, rather than spending more on cohesion for the poorest countries in Europe where we don't get a rebate. As I said, the best way to protect our net position which makes sense is to keep the rebate and keep the overall level of spending down. I agree with him that the key is to set the ceilings at a level so the ceilings aren't just coming down but they constrain the budget and that's what we have managed to do. Will the Prime Minister welcome the budget agreements to introduce transition regions, which should give a useful boost to economic growth and investment and should be worth to us in South Yorkshire an extra 300 million. Will he pay tribute to the local authorities led by all political parties that argued so strongly for this support? Will he explain why the Government remained opposed to transitional reasons right until the very end? What I can confirm is that Britain will benefit in terms of transition  We go into these negotiations arguing always that we need to look at all levels of spending and all economies because I think it's hypocritical to argue you have to cut the overall spending but protect every single bit of what Britain receives, but the good news is that we have likely to be 11 regions that will  tees valley, Lincolnshire,  Highlands and islands,  Cumbria, east Yorkshire, north Lincolnshire, Northern Ireland and Devon, those will all  we hope, transition regions under the new plan. Can I put on record my thanks and recognition for his clearly formidable negotiating skills. Does this not show that any British Prime Minister is strengthened when there is a Commons vote behind him whether that be for an EU referendum or an EU budget cut? I am grateful to my honourable friend for his support. I think it is absolutely right to say that the fact that the British parliament speaks clearly about this issue is listened to carefully in the corridors of Brussels. That's true. We should always respect the fact that it is to this parliament that Prime Ministers have to answer. What did other leaders say to the Prime Minister in the margins about a British referendum, and does the Prime Minister believe that this budget deal makes a case for Britain staying in Europe stronger? In terms of the reaction I have had to the speech that I made a few  I would say on the whole, it's been fairly positive because people can see it's not just simplistic argument about an immediate referendum, it's a well- argued case, Wye say, for how Europe should reform and how we should secure Britain's place within it. I think these discussions show that Britain can get good deals done with partners in Europe having made a speech on that subject. I think actually it strengthens Britain's place in Europe. Can I congratulate the Prime Minister on what was described as a budget-blinder. In particular, I wonder if it gives him heart as he purr saous the wider reform -- pursuesed wider reform agenda. Can I thank my honourable friend for  This is one step of many steps we need to make to reform the European Union. All of which should be good for other countries in Europe as well as for Britain. Is it still the Prime Minister's understanding that it the 38.6 billion euros described as out sides of the framework will lead to additional British payments? What estimates there has he made of the cost of these a decision will payments to the UK?There has always been this off EU budget spending and it is important we control that as well. The Germans have been focused on this agenda and have made some proposals on  too. Can I congratulate the Prime Minister on his statement. In view of the fact the United Kingdom only gets to have a veto on the EU spending limits of once every seven years, and given the fact 4365 Eurocrats are paid more than either Mia right honourable  the Prime Minister or the German counts -- Chancellor. Why do millions of British people come to the conclusion that this country would be better off outside the EU?  it is only once every seven years you have the unanimity is so able to achieve a deal like  I do not share his view that Britain would be better off outside the European Union. I accept that we need to convince people that Europe lives on a tight budget and bureaucracy lives on a tight budget.

Just as Government Park -- departments here have made huge  the same should apply in  The future of the euro remains uncertain and there was a wobble in the markets last week. Are there still some European politicians who believe the euro is a good idea and is safe?The answer  yes. We have had this exchange before.

I do think we have to understand the fact that for some European leaders and politicians, the euro is an article of faith, and they will do everything they can to save their  That is why I think we should be planning on the basis of change in Europe when the eurozone requires a change of the currency and we should use that opportunity to win changes for countries outside the euro.

So opening missions in Europe under represents? I think my honourable friend is right. And there is a danger the European external actions service, which is part of the Lisbon Treaty, there is a danger it starts duplicating what individual countries do us. We need to work hard to make sure it is adding value rather than displacing  Given the significant difference between the payment ceilings and the commitment  what does the Prime Minister thing is the likelihood of the EU having to increase the annual budgets beyond the levels set out in the MAFF on a year by year basis? Over the last financial  there was something like a 7% gap on average between commitments and payments. I would argue a 5% gap is safe. I think what you will see is lots of efforts by the institutions of the European Union now they are on a tighter budget, to spend their money more effectively and use the bedroom available. It is understandable and it might lead to better financial planning, but where we can be confident is that the ceilings are fixed and as a  the spending will be less. There is rejoicing in Somerset at the good news the Prime Minister has brought back. I wonder if he could say to the House what example this sets for the renegotiation and if it bodes extremely well for getting it back to Britain? I am glad to no good people of Somerset are in a hearty mood. What it did show if you build alliances and makes strong arguments and if you are prepared to stand up for what  you can get a good deal We have just heard the Leader of the Opposition seeking to claim credit for the Prime Minister's achievement. I note the Prime Minister is a charitable man, but given the support from the shadow Chancellor, can we give them a little bit of credit if they manage to get their socialist MEPs to support the deal?That is the  it is one thing saying something in this Parliament, the real test of leadership is can you  not just your own Socialist  but all of the Socialist MEPs. If you think it is such a good idea, he is such a leading player in the Socialist group, he can convince  but not a word. May I congratulate the Prime Minister on rejecting calls for a further review of our rebate. Would he agree with me it is time the party opposite apologised for when they were in power, they gave away nearly half of the rebate which is costing the country billions of pounds? My honourable friend makes a good point, but they have not learnt the lessons. The Labour group in the Europeans Parliament, the progressive allows of socialist and Democrats have called an end to  including ours. It is in their EU budget reforms of  say the Social and Democratic Group calls on the open -- Commission to put an end to all forms of rebates. Far from learning from their mistakes, they would like to do it again. And number of newspapers in this new -- country have been banging on about Europe for many years. Often cynical about our influence. Does the Prime Minister share my disappointment that on Saturday morning and number of newspapers, including the Daily  relegated his victory to a small article on page eight, whilst the Financial Times's Harold it is as a significant victory and even the figure Road described it as a master stroke? I'm grateful to my honourable friend. I will have to spend a bit more time studying the European press. I hope people can see it is a good deal for Britain and indeed, taxpayers across Europe. This excellent  which is good for Britain  paves the way does it  for Britain to continue developing alliances, setting sensible targets to reform Europe in a way which will end up having a more competitive business environment. Does the Prime Minister agree? A do agree with my honourable friend. It is important we tried to shrink the Agriculture part of the Budget and grow the part of the Budget which is about investments. We want a modern, European economy that can take on the global race. In 2011, the Prime Minister vetoed the EU treaty. Earlier this year he made the Bloomberg declaration, promising an in-out referendum. Last Friday he forced the European Union to cut  Isn't he proving that he is a traditional Tory?

It gives the lie does it not, to the accusations from the party opposite that Britain is isolated in Europe ever since the Prime Minister used the veto a year ago. Is it not a combination of the red lines he has drawn an the strategy in the building of alliances that has led to the successful outcome? I thank my honourable friend for her  It is important that the issue of the fiscal treaty, if you cannot accept something, be prepared to say no. But it is vital to build alliances and Britain work closely with the Swedes, the Danes and the Dutch and the Germans to put forward a strong alliance for Europe's taxpayers. I congratulate the Prime Minister for last Thursday and Friday and the build  He will recall many people told him what he achieved in Brussels, said it could not be done.

That is what we have done over the single market where we had huge countries backing of use. That is why we are progressing and the EU trade deals. May I thank my right honourable friend as a having listened to the House on this issue is. Can I congratulate him on his good judgment by not taking the Deputy Prime Minister with him. Can I ask him to build on his success by organising an independent audit of the costs and benefits by membership of the European Union? I'm grateful to my honourable friend for his support.

In congratulating my Right Honourable Friend on this triumph, could I suggest to him that the bold bottom line on his long-term renegotiation of our role in Europe seems to have focused the mind wonderfully among other contributors to the budget? Can I thank him for his support? I think there is support in Europe for reform and for the agenda that we have set out, but we will have to work extremely hard to build alliances and win friends. It will be good for Europe and also good for Britain in Europe. Can I congratulate the Prime Minister on his historic success? Would he agree with me that not only has he delivered a budget cut, but that this is an important moment for growth in the European Union, with an important emphasis on research and development and competitiveness? He is entirely  We need changes to the Common Agricultural Policy in order to deliver more money into research and development and things that can  We have achieved that. I wish we had gone further in that regard that we can continue to make the argument in individual budget negotiations. May I echo the comments of support for my Right Honourable Friend, and the work that he and his ministerial team have done not only in the last week but in the months preceding these negotiations, engaging with countries like Germany, building  showing that Britain has influence in Europe and being positive? I think my Right Honourable Friend is absolutely  There is strong support for the different agenda items that we want to pursue, whether it is constraining the budget, competing in the single market, making sure that we are having the impact that we want in terms of tourism - we should build those alliances and work accordingly. I congratulate my Right Honourable Friend on the great job that he has done, not only for the British taxpayer, but also for the European taxpayer. One of the problems with the European Union is that it is often far too inward-looking - can he say what progress was made at the European Council on free trade agreements in a global sense?What do conclusions at the council agreed were that we were going to open discussions with  we are enthusiastic about the potential for a trade deal between EU and the US, and that we were close to completion on the free-trade agreement with Canada. The paper submitted on this was one of the most pro trade, pro-reform papers that I have seen, which is thoroughly to the good. May I also congratulate the Prime Minister on his significant success over the European negotiations? Does he share my confusion over the party opposite's position on this? On the  the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Chancellor are seeking to claim  yet the most senior Labour politician in government, the First Minister of Wales, is critical, and is calling for a higher budget settlement? Does he show my confusion on that? I have to admit, it is confusing. Labour MEPs have voted against a freeze in the EU  when they were given the  What we need to hear from the party opposite is them showing some leadership, and telling their MEPs that it is a good deal for Britain, and they are going to back it. Let me give him another chance - will his MEPs be backing this budget, yes or no? That was a no. Mr Ball has, you are barking in the most bellicose fashion at the government benches. I know that when you don't at  you do not do it quietly, but a degree of restraint would be appreciated. I am sure my constituents in Kettering would want me to congratulate Warmley the Prime Minister on negotiating this cut in the budget?Will he take this opportunity to name and shame those of our European partners who most vociferously resisted attempts to cut the European budget? I am afraid to say that the people who most opposed a cut to the administrative part of the European budget is actually the European Commission itself. They make a series of arguments about the extra rolls and duties they have had to  but I do not believe they have properly looked at what member states have done in terms of pay  in terms of pension reform, in terms of reform of allowances, they simply have not looked at what other countries have had to do and at what they should be doing in  The Prime Minister had led the pack on trade and growth - will he continue to use his position to make sure that the Japan and US mega-deals are nailed as soon as possible, which will mean billions for the European economy?

Can I can graduate the Prime Minister, and will he note that the Shadow Chancellor has cheered the Prime Minister more this afternoon that he has done his own leader for the past year?  what does the the Prime Minister make of the Shadow Chancellor's claim in the Yorkshire Post this weekend that Labour have absolutely not ruled out a referendum? Well, I was about to .. The Prime Minister is responsible for many things, but he is not responsible for the policy positions of the Shadow Chancellor, and certainly not the quotes which are attributed to him in the Yorkshire Post. All Akpan do is to reflect on your ruling that the Shadow Chancellor is indeed barking. Just for clarification, we do not mean barking as in Barking &  we mean it as in woof. I also congratulate the Prime Minister on an outstanding deal  You can tell it is outstanding because the French and the Labour Party are agreed in congratulating the Prime Minister on his negotiating stance.

It is an extremely exciting course, and I am sure it will get an enormous amount of support. But I do think there is further work to  looking at some of the smaller headings, where there is room for further savings. With a record of giving away the UK rebate, Hansard is littered with the party opposite wittering on about us being isolated in Europe. After pledging to give the British people a say on a future in Europe, which they have not, and now having achieved this historic success in the budget negotiations, what would he now say to them? I hope what they can do is to turn to their friends in the European Parliament and say to the Socialist MEPs, this is a good deal for Europe, and they should vote for it. Let me give him another chance, because this is  Oh, he cannot intervene on his own MEPs! Well, what is the point of a Leader of the Opposition, if they cannot lead? Thank you, Mr  Firstly, I want to start by congratulating.. On North Africa and the Middle East, despite the wave of change, some of those countries are now more susceptible to extremism and radicalisation, such as Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. Were these countries discussed?. As I said earlier, there was a discussion specifically about Miley  but I do think there is more to be done to support the building blocks of democracy in countries  -- about Mali. Has my Right Honourable Friend received any apology from the Shadow  who said last October that the Government had failed to deliver the alliance's needed to deliver a real terms budget cut? I am not sure he really does  but it has been great to be cheered to the echo by the Shadow Chancellor today. It is not something that I'm going to expect every time I am here, but it has been a pleasure. Mr Speaker, as a business owner, when negotiating with suppliers, I was always able to drive down costs when there was a clear alternative. On the same principle, was his hand strengthened by the Euro-sceptic stance of the UK ahead of the 2017 referendum? I think there was an understanding, particularly amongst the net contributor countries, that it really was time for proper budget discipline. I think in previous negotiations, countries have gone into these negotiations and actually not focused on the fact that if we are controlling our own budgets at home, there is a real case for doing it properly in  I am delighted that we have achieved that. It is in the do triumph today for the Prime  and I do congratulate him.  his wife does design very nice handbags, I might say. Does he agree with the Shadow Chancellor, in the Yorkshire Post, who said, we have got a problem? Does he recognise further that it would be pretty stupid to allow ourselves to going to either of those positions? I think my French short makes a very good point, which is, we have got a clear plan -- I think my Honourable Friend makes a very good case who's for Europe, and these accusations against us could cause uncertainty. But the argument against would be, what could cause greater uncertainty than being in favour of a referendum one minute, then against it -- than against it the next? They really have got to the Prime Minister for getting an historic victory in Europe. After answering questions in the chamber, could my right honourable friend tell me and also, given the woeful negotiating skills of the party opposite in Europe, are we any closer to knowing whether the Leader of the Opposition will be able to convince his MEPs to vote for this deal? I don't think we are any closer to getting an answer. What we have heard though is good news. The Liberal Democrats will be voting for this budget in the European  The Conservatives will be voting for this budget in the European Parliament. We now need to hear from the Labour Party, not only about their own MEPs but socialists across Europe. They should be convincing them. THE SPEAKER: Statement the Secretary of State for Health. With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the funding of care and support in  As we get older, none of us can have any way of knowing what care needs we will eventually face. Some will be blessed with a long and healthy life, but many others will be less fortunate.  many older people and people with disabilities face paying the  often ruinous costs of their own care with little or no assistance from the state. Whilst those with assets of less 250 do receive support, those with assets above this level receive none. This is desperately unfair. Particularly for those who've worked hard all their lives to pay off their mortgage to save for their future or to have something to pass on to their loved ones, only to see their property sold, their savings wiped out and this is something that happens to more than 000 people every year or 100 Whilst ensuring that the greatest level of financial support goes to those with the greatest need. We propose to introduce a cap on an individual's financial contributions towards the costs of care and a significant increase in the level of assets a person may hold and still receive some degree of support from the state. In 2010, this Government asked economist Andrew Dilnot to look at the issue of funding and care and support. The Dilnot Commission published its reports in July 2011. In response to the recommendations, and following an extensive engagement with the care and support sector, we have published the care and support White Paper and the progress report on funding reform in July 2012. In the progress report, we accepted some of Andrew Dilnot's main recommendations, including those around a consistent nationally set eligibility threshold for care and support and universal deferred payments whereby no-one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care costs. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Andrew and his team for their excellent work. A core principle set out by the Dilnot Commission was that people should contribute to the costs of their  but those costs should be limited and they should be protected against the potentially catastrophic costs of care. This should come through a cap on costs and through an extended means test. One person in ten will be faced with care costs in excess of  A small number facing costs significantly higher still. To give everyone peace of mind, from April 2017, we will introduce a cap on the amount that someone over state pension age will be libel to pay. The Dilnot Commission's original suggestion was between �25,000 and �55,000 on  the quiflts of between 000 and �61,000 in April 2017 prices -- equivalent. Despite the extremely challenging economic situation we find ourselves in, we have come as close to that range as possible. The capital will be -- the cap will be set at �75,000 once it's introtuesed in April 017. The intention is not that people should have to pay up to �75,000 for their care costs. But by creating certainty that this is the maximum they will have to pay, they can then make provision through insurance or pension products so that they are covered up to the value of the cap, thereby reducing the risk of selling their home or losing an inheritance that they've worked hard to pass on to their family. Young people who already have care needs when they turn 18 will now receive free adult care and support when they reach 18 and people who develop a care need after 18 but before state pension age will be protected by a cap that is below 000 threshold. The other measure we propose is to significantly increase the amount of assets a person can hold and still receive financial support for their residential care home costs.  this is set at �23,250. A person has assets value above  including in some circumstances the value of their  they receive no support. The Dilnot Commission recommended that this threshold be raised dramatically to �100,000 in 2010-11  We accept this recommendation. From April 2017, the threshold will be increased so that those with assets worth �123,000 or less, equivalent to Dilnot's recommended level will all receive some degree of financial support for their care  People with the fewest assets will receive the most support.  for the first time, provide financial protection for those are modest wealth whilst ensuring that the poorest continue to have all or the majority of their costs paid. Everyone will benefit from the peace of mind that a cap will bring. The introduction of a cap and the extended means test support will help many people in the most challenging circumstances, we expect up to 16% of older people who need care to face costs of 000 or more, but of course none of us know whether we'll be in that  So everyone will benefit from the peace of mind these changes bring and by 2025, up 2010 0,000 more older people will receive financial support with their care costs as a result. The Chancellor and the Treasury have rightly insisted we identify how we pay for the additional costs of these proposals. In this day and  making promises you can't pay for makes those promises  so we have identified exactly how to pay for them. These reforms will cost the Exchequer �1 billion a year by the end of the next Parliament. With the agreement of the  these will be met in part by freezing the inheritance tax threshold at �3 25,000 for a further three years from 2015-16. The Chancellor and the Chief Secretary have agreed that the remaining costs over the course of the next Parliament will be met from public and private sector employer national insurance contributions revenue associated with the end of contracting out as part of the introduction of the single tier pension. These two new proposals join with others previously announced when we published the draft care and support White Paper last summer. They include from 2015, the ability of people to defer the payment of residential care costs sono-one need sell their home to pay for them during their lifetime. Also  the introduction of a national minimum eligibility threshold to end the lottery of local access that can see support provided to someone in one area but not in another. Taken together, today's proposals and those already set out in the draft Care and Support Bill represent a new era of support for the elderly and disabled in England, thanks to the certainty they introduce rather than people feeling they have to hoard every penny in case the very worst should happen or feeling they are powerless and there's no point saving at all, people will be able to plan and prepare sensibly for their future. They'll be supported be a wider range of financial products becoming available in the market designed to help people to plan and prepare for their later years and to reassure them about how much they'll pay. We'll work with the support sector, with local authorities, charities, care providers and individuals and with the financial services industry to develop these plans and introduce them practically. Mr Speaker, our society is ageing. By 2030, the number of people aged 85 or over will double and the number of people with dementia will exceed  As the number of older people with such long-term conditions increases, we need to become a society where people prepare and plan for social care costs as much as they prepare and plan 230 their pension. Sadly, this is an issue that Governments of all colours have long failed to tackle. Whilst there are many other things that need to be done to prepare for an ageing population, these reforms hold an important way in how reforms are held. The economic circumstances are challenging but the commitments demonstrate our determination to help people who've  saved and done the right thing to prepare for the uncertain hand that fate deals all of us in old age. By introducing the reforms within the time scale and threshold set  they'll will sustainable and consistent with our overriding priority to reduce the deficit inherited from the last Government. We want our country to be one of the best places in the world to  These plans will give certainty and peace of mind about the cost of care, making sure we can all get the support we need without facing unlimited costs whilst also ensuring the most support goes to those with the greatest need. I commend this statement to the House. Can I thank the Secretary of State for His statement and for early  I agree with him that our current social care system in England is the worst of all possible worlds. A cruel lottery where people go into latest life with everything they have worked for on the roulette table, where the most vulnerable are always the biggest losers. It needs to change and the Secretary of State has tabled a modest plan which will make the system fairer than it is today and we congratulate him for  We welcome elements of what he has announced today, a cap of 000 will protect people from the catastrophic costs of care. And raising the means test threshold will help more people on lower incomes get some help with care  So this is a step forward,  but it is a faltering  The House has been presented with a flawed prospectus today. Vulnerable people will still face rising care charges, homes will still be lost. Despite valiant attempts to put the best possible spin on things in the weekend media.  the Deputy Prime Minister made the claim that the Government was "Going to crack the care conundrum". Today, faced with this package, it sounds suspiciously like overselling, or, as Stephen Burke, the director of United for all Ages described it, "The dampest of damp squibs".  on the Andrew Marr show, the Secretary of State said "I've been hauled before the speaker before and I wouldn't want that to happen again and I I don't want to go into the details." now that we have heard the details, perhaps the Secretary of State could explain which part of his statement had not been pre-briefed to the media? It's disappointing that a statement of this importance to so many people was first briefed to the media rather than to this house, disappointing that the Government has abandoned any effort first to build a cross party consensus before rushing to announce its proposals and disappointing that the gaft's chose tonne rewrite the Dilnot Report with figures of its  breaking its careful logic -- the Government's chose to rewrite the Dilnot Report. The first thing, this fails the fairness test. We'll have a durable solution if it can answer this question - will it help every person, every couple protect what they have worked for, whatever their wealth and savings? I'm afraid the answer is no. According  the �35,000 cap would 2 million pensioners. A 000 would benefit 1.4  The cap will be �150,000 for the average couple. This might be enough to protect detached houses but not the average semi- detached home in large parts of  As Andrew Dilnot said  the cap is higher than we would have wanted, �11,000 higher than the top end of our range and I  Will the Secretary of State confirm that people with modest to average homes are not protected under the plan and isn't it a plan for the few and not the  further proof that we are not all in it together? The Secretary of State claims insurance companies will step in with new products to help more people protect their  but in evidence to the Health Committee, the ABI said they did not believe the capped costs model would result in a market for pre-funded care insurance. So what further confidence can the Secretary of State give the House today that a market will in fact emerge? Second, this plan is at best a partial solution. With this  the Government's prioritised the funding of a cap on care costs with new money over and above addressing the crisis in council care budgets. Will the Secretary of State confirm that this was against the advice of Andrew Dilnot to the cross party talks? What it means in practice is that vulnerable people will continue to face rising charges as councils put up fees to cope with the growing shortfall in their  making it more likely that they'll in time have to pay right up to the new �75,000 cap. To many, that would feel like progress. Care charges are rising above inflation, councils warn that by 2024, they'll be overwhelmed by the costs of care. Does the Secretary of State accept this forecast and if he does, how will the plans he's announced help to address it? If he fails to face up to the current crisis in council  isn't it the case that with care charges rising, the announcement will feel like a con. The Government's raised the capital threshold and we welcome that, but can the Secretary of State give the House any confidence that the extra support people receive through a more generous means test will not be more than offset by increasing care charges caused by collapsing council budgets? What people don't  may not know, is that the cap doesn't reflect what people pay for care but a local authority average and doesn't include accommodation  This was not mentioned in the statement. Won't feel feel coned if the Government doesn't make this clearer to them? The third problem is, this package disguises another coalition U-turn, this time on inheritance tax. In  a flagship pledge was made - it's very ironic, Mr Speaker - a flagship pledge was made to increase inheritance tax threshold to �1 million. Just eight weeks ago, the Chancellor said he'd increase The irony will not be lost that they are now increasing death taxes to pay for their plan. Does he think it is fair to ask this part of the population to pay for this, rather than older people? Finally, this will not bring more integration of care, instead, it will entrenched the separation between two systems. Would it not have made more sense to have set these out as part of a single vision? Mr Speaker, the Secretary of State has made progress, but has missed an opportunity to produce a long-term plan which has vergers to  built on a cross-party  What older people really needed was a far bigger and bolder  Mr Speaker, really! He talked about the prospectus, but what we have had from the Labour Party in 13 years in power was no prospectors whatsoever. It was in their manifesto in 1997.

But to describe this as only helping people on higher incomes is to fundamentally misunderstand how the cap works.  the �1 billion a year which this is going to cost the Government by the end of the next Parliament, 70% of that, potentially more, is actually going to socially disadvantaged families. This is a highly progressive  What we are doing as well as increasing the cap is increasing the threshold above which you do not get any help, from �23,000 to 000, exactly the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime thing which some of the most disadvantaged families will benefit from. -- exactly the kind of thing. This has been described today as a positive step forward in tackling the challenges of an ageing society. If you want some more quotes, Julio Arca what financial services have  -- let's have a look at what the financial services companies have been saying. As for local authority budgets, the shocking state of which we inherited from the last Labour  this Government, in the Spending Review, said that the NHS and health budget would give �7.2 billion of support for health- related needs to local authorities during this Parliament. On inheritance tax, what he does not understand about today's measures is that fundamentally, it is helping people to protect their inheritance from the lottery of social care costs. The randomness of not knowing whether you're going to be the one in 10 who actually suffers from more than �100,000 incurred costs is eliminated by a proposal which allows everyone to plan and prepare for their own social care costs. But his biggest  he describes this as a modest plan, saying we have neglected the scale of the problem,  of course, when we are dealing with an ageing population, there are many other issues which need to be dealt with.

Does he further agree with me that the package that my Right Honourable Friend the current leader of the House set the Dilnot commission within weeks of this government taking office, and that the package he announced today was described by Andrew Dilnot today as being not so different from that which was recommended by the commission set up by our Right Honourable Friend? I absolutely  He speaks wisely, as ever. I also want to pay tribute to the work of my predecessor in layer and  in making the big call that we needed to have the Dilnot  and then last year, publishing a white Paper, which moved this agenda much further forward than had happened in any of the 13 previous years of the Labour  He is right about the fundamental randomness and  Of course, we are not saying that the Government will pay for all the social care costs which  Public finances could not possibly be an estate to allow that to happen. But it what it does  it allows people to plan, it provides certainly, so that people can cope with the randomness and unfairness of the system, and that their precious inheritance will not be put at risk. At a �75,000, the cap is too high to help people in an area like Salford. The Secretary of State has talked about insurance products developed to help people meet the cost of the cap, but in our inquiry, the Health Select Committee was told that this country has no market at all in long-term health insurance. -- care  Not only that, no country in the world has a working model in this kind of area. Is it not wishful thinking of the highest order to talk about people being able to rely on products which do not exist here or anywhere else in the world? A lot of people were to get in on this very important  so can we please have brief questions and short answers? I am afraid that sums up the attitude of the opposition.They thought it was wishful thinking to try to solve this problem, but we are getting on with a solution. We do not have those financial product available at the moment, but the point of these structures is that we will help to create a market in which it is possible for these structures to exist. -- these structures to exist. -- these  Raising the threshold 000 to �123,000 to have any part of that. I welcome the statement to date, particularly the rise in VAT threshold. I remember the shock that my former patients used to feel, realising that anything over �23,000, they would have to be meeting the entire costs. But can I ask the Secretary of State to look again at the impact on rural local authorities? In  we have the fifth Ortiz population in England, for example. I will certainly do that, and I am grateful for her comments. I would  I think it is in some of those areas which have a high proportion of older people that the impact of the current lottery in care provision is so dramatic, and needs addressing so quickly. I would hope that her constituents will welcome the certainty in these  The minister has concentrated on the impact on the frail and elderly, but does he recognise the other care crisis which has been highlighted in a recent report, published by leading disability charities, which relate to the assistance of providing social care to working-age disabled  who currently make up about a third of social care recipients? The shortfall we estimate is about 2 billion, the gap in social care budgets in this area. These proposed laws will go some way to addressing that problem. -- these  For adults who become disabled during their working life, they will have a cap, but it will be a lower cap, so we will be able to offer very important support for both of those groups. I welcome this statement, but isn't the situation that for a lot of  the social care costs are so much more expensive, particularly in rural areas, with elderly populations, and they will more likely hit that cap more quickly? Can he assure us that everything will be done to make sure that the cost of care in these more expensive areas is brought down? It is for areas like that that we think these proposals will be particularly effective, because the higher the costs, the sooner you reach the Cup, the sooner you get the support you need. -- the  Nobody can deny that elderly people live in fear of having to go into care and what that means for them. -- cap. What discussions has he held with the devolved administrations, to make sure that our elderly citizens have peace of mind in regard to old age? This is a devolved matter, as he  but there are different approach is being tried in all of the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom, and we must all learn from each other. Does the overall approach promise uncertainty and predictability, where previously there was anxiety and uncertainty, is that not the big game? That is the main point of what is being announced today. With the public finances being as they  we are not able to offer a huge amount of support, but what we can do is give the certainty which means that for the first time, people will be able to plan and make provision for the social care  We will be one of the first countries in the world to do that. The Alzheimer's society has said today that capping care costs is a step in the right direction, but 000 is so high, but it will only help if you. The Secretary of State knows that there are 800,000 people living in this country now with dementia. His announcement today does not deal with the community care costs that those people are facing day today. �1.3 billion will be going out of community costs to local authorities - how will he fill that gap? As she knows well, and she has spoken movingly on the issue of  what I would say about what the Alzheimer's society has said is that to look just at the cap in isolation is to misunderstand his proposals. For many people with dementia, the most significant thing will be the increase in the threshold for state support from �23,000 to �123,000, which is a big step forward. With respect to the cap, it is not saying that we expect people to pay 000 people's -- to pay �75,000 towards their care costs, we are saying that that is the maximum anyone will have to pay. That makes it possible for people to make provisions in pensions and insurance policies. When it comes to dementia, one in three of us  and this allows you to put some certainty in place, to make plans now, so that when you're dealing with that nightmare in your  you do not have the double whammy of having to worry about Secretary of State for Bringing  Can social and health budgets be worked more closely together? He's absolutely right. That is I think perhaps the biggest remaining issue that we'd have to face in the NHS in the social care  There are interesting parts of the country like in Torbay where that is happening effectively, but anything that can be done in North Yorkshire to make that happen more speedily would be very welcome. Mining constituencies have some of the highest percentage of home ownership of anywhere in the  so this is anish wrue that affects them. Further to the question the honourable gentleman asked earlier, what discussions has the Secretary of State had with the Welsh Assembly because I'm presuming that there'll be a consequential amount of money going  how much is that going to be? All the consequential issues will be decided by the Treasury and we'll comply with them. Is it possible to have transitional arrangements, Mr Speaker? Four years is a long time to wait for a family already paying care costs. Would it not be possible to increase the cap to �20,000 a year from now on or possible to allow care costs in excess of �75,000 to be set against inheritance tax in the future? I completely understand where my right honourable friend is coming from on this. All I can say is that we had to strictly produce a package that was affordable within the current financial  For that reason, we have come up with the pagage we  it's the earliest we think we can afford to do it and it's the lowest cap we can afford but I'll of course reflect on his comments -  What will happen between now and 2017? At the moment, many families are frightened about care costs and this statement has nothing for them. Their loved ones are likely to die in the next four  Two million people will die before this is implemented. What is he doing for local councils who at the moment are taking additionally for local councils a the moment trying to help people in this situation? I think she might show a little humility after her Government didn't do anything about this for 13 years. We are doing something about it as quickly as we possibly can. I warmly welcome the rise in the assets threshold, but I'm not clear about one aspect. People like my father had to sell their home in order to pay the costs of residential care. Now, it's being suggested that the accommodation and food would not be covered by  but given that the residential care aspect is so  can my right honourable friend give us reassurance? These proposals cover the care costs, but we will be making an announce for accommodation and food of �1,000 per month at 2017-18 prices. The reason for doing that is because you would face those costs anyway, whether or not you were in a residential care home and we think it's wrong to create a system where you were better off financially being in a residential care home rather than being at home. Beverage committed to the caid toll the grave as the principle in health care -- cradle to the grave. It's clear that what the Government's done today is giving up on the public sector to contributing to 000 figure. Has he any idea or has he enquired how much the cost of provision would be for a family to obtain cover for that 000? I think the honourable gentleman needs to study the proposals with a great deal more care because if he listened to  we are actually extending the help available to people who have to pay up to �75,000 dramatically by increasing the threshold from 000 to � 123,000 at 2017-18  Thank you, Mr Deputy  I warmly welcome the action my right honourable friend's  To the critics who say the cap should be lower, does he not agree with me that the main purposes are to provide protection for those people who face catastrophic charges, roughly 10-15  Does he agree this represents a fair resolution between the responsibilities of people to save for their retirement and the responsibilities of the communities to protect those against for whom catastrophic charges might apply?  my right honourable friend is absolutely right. This is about a partnership between the state and  recognising that the state is not able to bear all these costs on it own, trying to create the incentives and the certainty whereby pli vat individuals and citizens are able to make provision for their own social care costs in the way they do for their pension - - private individuals. It's a very important step forward. Do these proposals mean that someone with a 000 house pays �75,000 and someone with a �400,000 pays 000? Wouldn't it be fairer if the first �200,000 was charged at say 20% and the second at 40% so someone with a �200,000 house would 000 and someone with a 000 house �120,000. It would be a fairer system. Would he look at a fairer system rather than a flat rate poll tax? People whose houses have lower value benefit from the fact that we are increasing the threshold at which support is available and because of that increase in the threshold, they'll get some support towards paying for their �75,000 which people with higher value houses  Does the Secretary of State see any difficulty in this Government, the coalition  pretempting a future Chancellor of the Exchequer over tax policy when I thought everybody in the House wanted a different kind of Government after 2015 who might have their own ideasWell, we have funded these proposals until 2020 on plans that have been agreed by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. We hope very much that we'll have the support of the opposition for these plans as well, then we can have a national consensus around them which is what  In the end, if we are going to create that certainty in  people need to know whichever Government is elected, they support the principle. Obviously these proposals won't apply in Scotland where people already receive personal and nursing care as they need it, when  regardless of income. But is the Secretary of State aware that this approach has helped retues the number of people requiring long-term beds, it's also helped reduce NHS bed blocking and has enabled elderly frail people in Scotland to live in their own homes, rather than face the crippling costs of moving into residential care? There are some things that we can learn from Scotland and some things that we can't. Scotland has a very good record in identifying people with dementia and the point she makes about helping people to live at home for longer is a very, very good one. Care costs incurred in domiciliary care for people living at home will count towards 000 cap so we do hope to have many more flexible ways of people providing for themselves and being able to live at home and healthily for longer. I welcome today's statement, most welcome to my constituents will be the increase in the means test threshold of state support from 000 to �123,000. Given the figures from the ladge registry from December, the average house in Pendle was only at �114,000. -- Land Registry. Can my honourable friend confirm these represent a good deal for those in Pendle who're only of modest wealth? Well, that is absolutely the point. The group of people we are targeting with these proposals are not the most vulnerable because they already get all their care costs covered if their assets are less 000. It's the people one step up from that, people who in many cases have worked hard, saved all their lives, may have paid off their mortgage but may have a house that's not of sufficient value to cover the social care costs they  I hope the proposals will be very welcome in Pendle. Can the Secretary of State assure me and my constituents that any gains they may make from his proposals today will not be completely wiped out by the massive cuts to local authority care  �120,000 million in -- 000 alone in my authority?We have looked at the cuts areas are facing in order to make sure it shouldn't compromise adult social  They are not ringfenced budgets but that's why we have put in an extra �7.2 billion of support from the daement's budget where there are health related needs. We are watching that carefully -- Department of Health's budget where there are health related needs. Can the Health Secretary confirm that after 2017, there'll be index linking on the asset threshold and liability cap and is there an implied permanent link between the yield from inheritance tax and the nation's social care costs? I don't think that there is an implied link in the way he suggests. I will reflect on his comment to check I fully understood the brilliant insight he was making. With respect to the automatic  that is of course a matter for future Governments and future Members of Parliament, but certainly it's our intention that the proposals we are making would continue to take account of the change of the cost-of-living. I welcome aspects of the statement from the Secretary of State. Would he agree that the security that he's seeking to put in place in old age will not be effective for as long as companies like Phoenix Life are able to offer constituents like  Mr Gerard Burton, the �22 1 a month for the rest of his life at the age of 84 in return for half after oiz house. Will he speak to his colleagues in the Treasury to ensure that there is great scrutiny over precisely what financial products are being offered in this domain? I don't know the details that he's talking about but I would be happy to speak to Treasury colleagues on that issue. This statement will be very welcome in my constituency with a high proportion of retired and elderly  Can I warmly congratulation my right honourable friend on gripping a problem that's alouded previous Governments. Can he confirm that the new higher savings threshold of �123,000 will not include the value of a couple's home when the spouse or dependent on a person in residential care still resides in that home? I can In terms of the financial products that will be available, can the Secretary of State produce the evidence so constituents in Hull can find out what kind of figures we are talking about in terms of protecting themselves for the future?Well, I'm making the announcement today so I think we have to give the financial services industry some time to respond to this proposal, but the indications are encouraging and I think we'll all see in plenty of time for the 2017 start of this plan what products are available. There may be separate products but it may also just be something that becomes part of people's pension planning so in the same way that people decide in their pension what arrangements they want for an annuity or lump sum payment, it may be that pages up to the costs up to the level of the cap becomes part of that pension as well. We need to let the pension and insurance industries have the time to respond and come up with those plans.  Mr Speaker. Does my right honourable friend agree with me that in evaluating these  the public need to understand the nasty secret at the heart of social care in this country which is that we have amongst the harshest of means tests which leads to catastrophic costs. Will he ensure in making the reforms that he provides the committee's bill with all the necessary details of how this will be implemented? Happy to do that and I'm grateful to his committee for the work they've done in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny to date and he'll understand why I couldn't go into details when we met last week to discuss the Bill. But yes, he is absolutely right. Dealing with that threshold is one of the most important things and I'm sure I want to know what the costs  Would carers cost count towards the cab?? The us, they  -- yes, they would. I notice in the share drupe share gritty of state's comments he called for a bigger response. What estimate does my honourable friend make of the potential costs of a bigger response? Does he not think any criticism should have a source of funding to have credibility? I thank my honourable friend for that. The shed a Minister was complaining we have not adopted the CAB he  -- Shadow Minister. I think it is up to the opposition to tell us how they will find that money. Is it not likely the decline in services will accelerate the point of which people of forced to enter residential care? Has the fact that these rising costs into his calculation?The care costs people have at their home or will be included in the amount calculated towards the CAB. We are hoping for the opposite. That would be something people would welcome. At the heart of controlling social  financially and on a  is a structure that allows more people to live at home happily and healthier for longer. Does my honourable friend agreed to be credible on social care funding, any package needs to be fully funded? Absolutely. There was a time when the party opposite would have considered a package worth a billion pounds a year was a significant investment but in their free-spending ways, a billion here, a billion there, now they are talking real money. A can I congratulate my honourable friend on a real and meaningful step forward in the social care debate? Can I ask him, for the sake of the  the Shadow Minister may be ready -- made a representation of a spending commitment. How much will it cost the country? The Shadow  what he was saying, it would have cost the country to �0.4 billion on top of the proposals we are outlining. -- �2.4 billion. They would either reduce spending or increased taxes. Perhaps they are thinking of adding to the  I welcome my honourable friend's announcement and the progress he has made. He will be aware in a constituency such as  a terrace house can cost less 000, there will still be concern about these figures. Can he ensure his department passes the information to local authorities and organisations who advise people in the hope they can clearly understand what the commitments of? And we will be happy to do that. -- was their commitments are? That low threshold of �23,000, beyond which they get no help, will be raised significantly to �100,000 in 2011. -- 2011 prices.

I greatly welcome the framework that is being  It should mean an extra �10 million for Wales.

I will first establish what the bonnet consequential loss. I will then be happy to talk. -- consequential as I would like to update the House on recent developments on horse meat and Food fraud. The events we have seen unfold over the past few days in the UK and Europe are completely unacceptable. Consumers need to be confident that food is what it says on the label. It is outrageous consumers have been buying products, labelled beef, which turn out to contain horsemeat.

I have made clear my expectation food businesses need to do whatever is necessary to provide assurances to consumers of their products. The Minister of State and the FSA met food retailers on 4th February and made clear we expected the food industry to publish results of their own testing of meat products to provide a clear public picture of standards in the food chain. In response to the Findus announcement, the FSA asked all producers and retailers test all their processed beef products for the presence of course  On Saturday, I called in the major food retailers, manufacturers and distributors to make clear my expectations that they needed to verify and trace the source of all they are processed beef products without delay.

On Saturday, after a conversation with the food industry representative, I realised the Secretary of State had not revealed the names of the firms to the food industry at the meeting. Why not? If the Government wants the food industry to test on the basis of risk, why did he not share the names at the Saturday meeting?  it was announced the statutory testing regime with councils testing eight samples each.

When will he stop hiding behind civil servants and take responsibility? Does he think that surveying 224 products from across the country matches the scale of the scandal when he has asked supermarkets to test thousands of their products by Friday? Can he confirm today that not all of those thousands of tests will be completed by Friday? Can he say how many products that the large public sector catering suppliers will test? How many lines that the meat processors the association will Test? He said some members of the hospitality Association and Retail Consortium have withdrawn products. Can he say which members have withdrawn which  and whether any of them supply schools, prisons and hospitals? The supermarkets acted with speed and transparency that puts him to shame. I am disappointed the hospitality industry and the caterers have not been so candid. In his letter he said that the Food Standards Agency are taking up individual incidents with the authorities and police across Europe. He said in the media there is an international criminal conspiracy at work. Does he think that international criminals are present everywhere apart from the United Kingdom? The French Government's estimates that the Findus Ford has netted 300,000 euros alone. This is clearly criminal business. -- Findus Ford. -- fraudulence. At questions almost three weeks ago I asked about horses contaminated with a drug, slaughtered in the UK and entering the food chain. It has been confirmed of the nine horses that tested positive, one was stopped, five went to France, two to the Netherlands and Amore to the UK. When council officials approached people who had supposedly taken the horse to eat it they had no knowledge of what happened to it.

The retailer should use their profits to ensure the quality of their product and what they are selling is what they say  My honourable friend is absolutely right. Consumers must have faith in the products provided by the retailers. It is the retailers' responsibility to present consumers of goods which are wholesome, of quality and conform to the label. It really is important that retailers get out there and sell their systems and their products to keep the faith of the consumer. I am sure the Minister would agree Findus have serious questions to answer. In  what was the exact date the company had a reasonable suspicion the supply IT was contaminated and who took the decision not to announce an immediate product recall? -- the supply chain it was contaminated. Does the Minister agree with me it is shameful the head of Findus has issued a word of contrition and flown to the UK? I am grateful to my honourable friend. I do -- I did talk to him on Saturday. We have got to be caught us what we say in the Findus case. Legal proceedings may be launched by Findus against their suppliers.

As soon as that evidence is corroborated by a scientifically valid laboratory  the product should be withdrawn publicly.

And his priority should be the safety of consumers and restoring confidence in our Great British food industry. However, he does know the National equine database was closed down in December last  I would like to ask him what assessment he has made of the impact of disclosure on the Department's ability to keep track of courses in the UK. Is he confident the current system let him keep track of equine movements? I thank my honourable friend for  She is quite right to raise the issue of equine databases. We have confidence we have access to all the information contained in the various ones around the country and we are clear the significant statements today by a noble lord that every horse carcass will be held until it is proved clear will be a great reassurance to the British consumer. It is the case that highly processed foods of this kind are more likely to form a larger part of low income families. There are too many of those in Newcastle, thanks to this Government's action. Is he seriously saying when someone buys a Burger they need to research the entire supply chain, rather than relying on that the Government and the Secretary of State? She must  it is the retailer under this system who is responsible. It is for the retailers to get out there and showed their customers they are processed beef customers are safe.

He professes concern about what is in the beat macro and the importance of labelling and yet the UK according to press reports is trying to get an exemption from European regulations to limit the amount of fat and connective tissue to bulk up minced meat to below 50%.

Does he not take responsibility and should he take more seriously the potential for the contamination of the human food chain with the drug phenylbutazone, which is not fit for human consumption? I would like to reassure him that this is a case  It is not a case of food  The noble lords said today that sadly 20,000 people go to hospital because of a food related complaint and tragically, 500 died, and according to the noble lord he does not know a single individual whose health has been affected by the import of these products. I do think honourable members must get this in perspective. He mentioned phenylbutazone. I would draw his attention to the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, who said that it is understandable people will be concerned but that it is important to emphasise that if it is found at low levels, there is a very low risk that it would cause any harm to health.Would he agreed that there is a degree of opportunism from the bench when we are operating under a system we inherited from them?

Given these concerns about horsemeat and the news at the end of January to pork DNA was found in pies which was supposed to be allyl, many of my constituents are concerned about the classification of halal meat. Can he tell me what meetings he has had to with the halal or certification organisations? I think he raises an important point. For many faith groups, it would be shocking to find they have eaten in appropriate material. This is a matter that is being taken up by the Food Standards Agency. If negligent or incompetent or criminal procedures are happy to contaminate projects with horsemeat, what else would they be prepared to cut these products with? Can the Secretary of State reassure my constituents other non-meat products have been tested for?We have no evidence there is any other meat product which is being used to contaminate bovine products. The Secretary of State told us this was an issue of fraud and his labelling. How can he be sure when the random testing needs to have tested 1.5% of course carcasses?

That is what I am  I am concerned this system is based on trust.

Then everybody is on their toes. That could deliver considerable benefits. Consumer confidence is key. Does my honourable friend agree there are serious questions over the conduct of EU neighbours?

You have gone too  We want to rein back the range of activities in the coming five  I hope to hear from the Minister at some words of encouragement as to what action I'll Government is taking to do that very thing. -- our government  That will prevent the agency encroaching on the competencies and their activities of the Council of Europe, which covers a 47 may embark -- 47 member Given we are sign done to the European Convention on Human Rights, much against my will, but there we  which has nothing to do with the European Union, can he explain why we need his body in the first place?The Government at the time had grave reservations about this being under the provisions of the lisping treaty for the very reason that this is a duplication of activity taking place and this is to set up a Duplicate body in the European Union, Duplicate to the Court of Human Rights. In answer to  it is intended to try to create what is called a fundamental rights culture within the European Union. To that end, this organisation does research, has conferences, one of which I  It produces very large tomes of documentation relating to what he described as fundamental rights in different countries within the European Union. It is clear from everything it does that its agenda is not to be an advisory  but to be a legislative body. That is the agenda. I hope my honourable friend will be able to reassure us the Government realises that is the agenda and has seen through it and is vigorously appraising that Agenda, which involves duplication of so much. I'm grateful to him for giving way. I am not clear. Could he give a precise summary as to what is the difference between a human right and a fundamental right? In essence, the fundamental rights agency is trying to deal with collective rights rather than individual ones. The European Court of Human Rights tries to deal with individual  It is a moot point. As with so many things, what happens is the European Union comes along and confuses the issue in by giving a similar name to an institution or body that already exists and thereby causes confusion. Whereas the Council of Europe, set up to start off with, we do not have a council of the European Union, but we have a European Union Council. We have a commission of the European Union and we have the European Union... It has stolen the flag which was the original flag of the Council of Europe and has stolen its anthem and now it is intent upon stealing the main part of its activities, which is to look after that human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. This is part of a creeping sickness. The European Union is trying to claim rights over Trans Frontier broadcasting so that it can tell Europe what we can and cannot  This afternoon, the hulls felt that it was trying to -- has thought it was trying to take  I wonder where he thinks this  He has been doing valuable work on trying to scrutinise what is happening on broadcasting. He reports on that subject within the European Assembly of the Council of Europe. To concentrate on broadcasting, it exemplified perfectly the problem. The Council of Europe set up a convention on broadcasting that has been signed up to not just by the 47 member countries of the Council  but by other countries. What has happened now is the European Union has said that this convention cannot be brought up to date because it cuts across a fundamental competence of the European Union. Therefore, the Council of Europe has been prevented from proceeding with Updating the broadcasting convention because it has been told by the European unit cannot. And because the European Union, because they have 27 of the 47 countries, if they say you cannot do that,  the Council of Europe member states collectively have no option but to obey what the European Union says. This is an example of the plan by the European Union to encroach further upon the territory and responsibilities of the Council of Europe to the extent that they wish to take over the whole organisation. That is what is sinister about this. If this were  we could be relatively relaxed about it. But this is costing serious money. We heard during the Second Reading debate that it is costing 83 million euros. At the moment, this agency that was set up less than ten years ago with a budget of nothing and now it has that amount of expenditure and the plans for the period to 2017 are to expand further. As we heard in the Prime Minister's statement today, he and fellow colleagues in the European Union are saying that enough is enough and we have to rein back on the expansionist programme of the European Union. When people say where? My view is that this is a good starting point. We did not want it in the first  I hope we will hear from the Government as to what we are doing to push it back. I am concerned about this. I wanted to be strengthened. I will come to that when I make my speech. Would he agree fundamental right supply to  for example, which we should determine nationally rather than internationally? I am in favour of us having control over these issues as a sovereign country. That is why I do not bite into the concept there is a standard of fundamental rights across Europe --  The Council of Europe is as guilty of this as the European Union because they are trying to find common factors across member countries and then impose what they interpret as the common factor upon all countries through either the fundamental rights agency or through the Council of Europe and European Court of Human Rights. These are serious issues. I look forward to hearing what he has to say about what he thinks and where he thinks the agency should go. This was set up as a compromise to provide something that would be based in Vienna because the Austrian said they did not have a European Union agency there. It is set up in Vienna and having been set-up there, the Austrians are at the forefront of giving it more power and money so that more people can be based in Vienna to contribute to the Austrian economy. That is the cynical way these things develop. It was a compromise  We have now seen that this organisation has a life of its own. I hope we will hear something to say the front bench will snuff this out before the framework. This is why I have pleasure in moving the  If this comes to a vote, I would seek to have a vote on amendment three. The question is that the amendment No 1 be made. I am interested in this because I have a strong interest and a life before Parliament in the trade union movement. My feeding is the agency and fundamental rights in the European Union are a paper tiger when it comes to defending workers' rights. Whether these rights are strengthened by legislation in this House, in this Parliament or at European Union level is a matter for debate. They need to be strengthened. An example of what a paper tiger's fundamental rights are in the European Union was the Viking Line when industrial action was taken and strangely, the fundamental rights to take strike action were overwritten of within - - for the interests of the  Their right so overran what seemed to have primacy over the fundamental rights of trade  I am not impressed by the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Union. If they are  the trade unionists should have been found to be in the right and not have the European Court of Justice ruling against them and finding in favour of  There have been two major cases like this that have shaken the confidence of many trade unionists who I think mistakenly put their faith in the European Union to defend their rights. I was never impressed with the European  I am a critic from a left point of view. Nevertheless, I was never confident that the European Union would defend trade union worker rights. I think I will not necessarily be voting with him on this particular vote, if it is  I want the fundamental rights of workers strongly supported and defended be based in the European Union, or bidet in the United Kingdom. It is a pleasure to rise in this sort of debate on these amendments. I wanted to talk about the agency in general terms. I am concerned about the growth of the number of agencies at European  As a member of the European Parliament I sat on the budgetary control committee. Its purview extended to the European agencies when we have proved their accounts. It was fairly obvious that the further away... People moan about the risk of fraud and maladministration in the European  but it was obvious that the further away from the European Commission the agencies were, the less scrutiny of their accounts  My concern for the fundamental rights agency is that giving it a framework with such an increased budget, I think could lead to issues in the way that it runs its accounts in the future. I am not saying it had issues in the  although it had an issue in  but we are talking about a massive expansion in this agency's budget. This is in a body that has little oversight from the European Commission, European Parliament and national Governments  Over the years, the European Court of auditors has sporadically looked at projects run by the fundamental rights agency. It would be fair to say they have been of mixed value. They have been improved over the course of time as you would expect them to. However, I can understand why there are concerns raised by the honourable member for Christchurch among the others about including an agency whose work obviously does duplicate some of the other bits of work going on within the European  within the Council of Europe and indeed possibly in other  We are talking quite a lot  The Prime Minister made a good point in his statement that these are times of austerity and we should expect European institutions to act in appropriate way. It is not to undermine the work that the  I hope the Minister could perhaps talk about in his words of his group of amendments through value-for-money the fundamental rights agency Gibbs. --
