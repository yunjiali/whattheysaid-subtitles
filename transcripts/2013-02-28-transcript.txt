That is it for this programme. Good morning and welcome to BBC parliaments live coverage of the House of Commons. In an hour, the leader of the House will be answering questions on forthcoming parliamentary business. That will be followed by two debates in the chamber initiated by MPs backbench business committee. The first concerns the campaign for the abolition of the death penalty in India and a second debate marks the 25th anniversary of their Kurdish genocide carried out by Saddam Hussein's Iraqi military in 1988. Don't forget to join me for our round-up of the day in both Houses of Parliament at 11pm tonight. First it is questions to the I welcome his support and that of his constituents for what the coalition government is doing.

This authorisation and labels authorities to place a part-time 20 mile per hour speed limit signs in the vicinity of schools without the need for central government approval. Councils can also use roundels on If the 20 mph limits are not done in the context of having targets, they will come to nothing in terms of reducing terrible road casualties, which are rising steadily in this country. When will he think again about having targets? The important things are that we take measures to make roads  rather than arbitrary targets. A previous Coalition Secretary of State suggested that 20 mph zones being increased to be a trade-off with 80 mph limits on some  Doing a U-turn at 80 would be crazy and dangerous. Can I invite the Minister to safely do a U-turn here and announce they will not go ahead with 80 mph?The matters about that are being carefully evaluated, Under- Secretary of State will make a statement in due course. I will ask questions for and six together. The Secretary of State announced that we would not continue with the Great Western competition. He also confirmed the department would enter into negotiations with First Great Western to secure in -- arrangements for a further 2.5  to September 2015. These negotiations are in progress. He will be aware that in the original tender document there were concerns in Cornwall about that a potential for the number of through services to be produced. Can he give an assurance to the House that the services will be protected at the current levels for a couple of years? Thank you. I am delighted to tell him that during the period of the extension we will maintain today's number of daily through services from London to Cornwall. The Truro to Falmouth service will remain at today's levels and will not have to be funded by Cornwall County Council, and the option for additional services on the St Ives to Penzance branch, from May, 2014, will be carried forward in this  Many of my constituents commute using the Great Western  and they continually raised issues of service and cost of  Will he assure me that the voices of the regular passengers will be listened to during the finance -- franchise process, and fully reflected in the final contract? I am grateful for that. He has done a tremendous work fighting for his constituents securing funding for the improvements to Reading station under London Heathrow Great Western  Can I reassure him that when the Secretary of State makes his announcement in the spring about the future progress of the franchising programme, all franchises will be extremely mindful of the needs of passengers, including those on the Reading line, as we approach any success of franchise arrangements, and we are committed to working with the industry to reduce costs and taken to account the needs and requirements for passengers.

Since the merger of Thames Trains with Great Western, to form this franchise, the interests of the commuter using the Great Western line have not sufficiently been addressed. We have the most crowded trains, the services are slower, there are fewer fast trains. What can he do to improve the service for the commuters on this line? I can tell her that we are looking at that and we will continue to.

Hastie we announce the creation of a �20 million new station month to open new stations in England and Wales. I'm not the competition in January and had to make an announcement by the end of one just to which they -- stations have been successful. We have also received a large number of bids for the pinpoint fund, and we hope to make an announcement shortly. Can the Secretary of State update the house on any talks he has had with the transport minister in Wales regarding the electrification of the Wrexham line and when can he hope that we can make progress on this and when can we finally, also, search the Deeside Industrial Estate? I am due to meet the minister in Wales shortly to discuss a number of issues and I am sure the points that the honourable member has raised will be one of those issues. I would also like to point out that we make major announcements as far as the next vacation is concerned and I realise it is South Wales, but I hope that honourable member will think it is the mood in the right direction. Lincoln finally has a direly direct service to London despite been promised seven links in 2010. Can the Minister assure me that my constituents will see her expansion of direct daily services and weekend services as we are aware of the need of our expanding city to enjoy rail links to the capital. What I will say to my honourable friend who now serves on the Transport Select Committee so will be able to keep an eye on the  is that we are always asked for After-service is and I appreciate the case he makes one  I will want to look at it and judge that in the context of all the other opportunities and requests that we get for extra  I can assure him I am aware of the case for Lincoln particularly in the light of the important celebrations it has coming up next year. Does the Secretary of State agree with me that, on the interconnection between high-speed one and High Speed 2, we are going to need a greater capacity than three trains per hour? As I have said on several occasions, I will want to consider those and look at the points he has made to see that we get at Connectivity, but there is also the point of those trains running directly from  and across to the Continent and we will need to judge that as we judge everything else around high-speed Rail? Rail passengers trying to put the cheapest fare are faced with a complex system. I would hope that the fares and ticketing review will result in a more straightforward  And my friend tell me what progress is made towards this? You are right to raise that point.

I intend to make a statement as a result of the Brian inquiry, and I will make that statement shortly. -  On 23rd November, I asked if he had been able to make an assessment on the impact the floods had had on the economy. He replied, saying it was too early to make that assessment. What progress has he made on this? And also, on fixing the railway line between Exeter and Plymouth. I am grateful to the way he races this point. He attended a meeting I organised in a House with the network rail chief executive and others, which gave him the opportunity of putting these questions to him. I am visiting his constituency later  and we will be talking more directly about it. If he refers to his answer to Question 18, he will be aware of the scandal surrounding wheel-clamping and the criminal elements which lend -- led to banning it. There are examples now moving across to ticket parking  300 companies have access to the DVLA database. What steps is he taking to prevent abuse of this? There are measures in place to prevent the abuse of the database. Parking companies cannot obtain data from the DVLA and less they are members of an accredited trade association. The DVLA ticks  and if necessary, they suspend members. In 2012, be suspended 21 parking companies from receiving that information. -- Les  Will he confirm that landowners of HS2 are within their rights to refuse access to consultants who want to survey their properties?

It is outrageous. This Government makes everyone aware as early as  You only have to put on the television and by the newspapers! Thank you for his comets! He will be aware that the Leader of the House has reminded ministers in the Cabinet that it is important that they come to the House to make statements here, first. May I refer my honourable friend to the answer I gave to him in writing in January, which indicated that the catering service and the parliamentary estates director it were considering apprenticeship schemes. The Department of facilities is aware of three apprentices have employed by people working on the parliamentary estate. We will be happy to discuss this further.  Will he make sure that the House of Commons does everything possible to employ more apprentices and will you link-up with the apprentice school which I have set up that helps a provide apprentices for MP's offices, and we can supply apprentices around the House of Commons? I am grateful for that suggestion and we would want to act on that. I pay tribute to the scheme that Mr Speaker has put through and the other schemes of this order. All of which help to get young people into employment from diverse backgrounds throughout  I do not want to be rude, but that seemed a pathetic response. This House employers a lot of people -- employs a lot of people and the supply chain to the House should be where we are demanding good food and demanding that the suppliers employ a fair number of apprentices. I have often criticised the management of this  it is not sharp enough. Let us have more apprentices now, please the stock he makes a good  -- let us have more apprentices now, please. He makes a good point. It is subject to European contracting regulations, and under that, one may express desires that one is not always able  But I can assure him that the House authorities are committed to ensuring that apprenticeships, internships, and encouragement for young people from all backgrounds into good employment whenever they can. Based on statistics from the Society of Klerk's at the table in the Commonwealth, and the European  the House of Commons sits for more days and for longer than most comparable parliaments. The important thing is not the number of days but how that time is effectively used. Does the Leader of the House believe that the success in this House of debates being scheduled by the backbench business committee is likely to be a model copied by other parliaments around the world? I agree with him at we are unique in this place, in having established backbench business committee which has a substantial proportion of the time  which is available at the disposal of backbench members without being controlled by the respective front benches. But is  When I visited the Scottish parliament last week, I was struck that although there is time for the members' debates, it is that the behest of the business  but the House is resolved to give backbenchers a substantial amount of time, which is welcome.  The three books most frequently borrowed from the library between 7th May, 2010, and 14 February, 2013, were, how Parliament works by a robber  -- Robert Rogers, borrowed  a broken the law, privileges and proceedings, edited by the clerk of the House, borrowed  And in third place,  by Tony Blair, borrowed 31 times.

He perhaps some progress made be made? -- made be made. The serious point but he makes is that colleagues are using these works, and they are up in need of updating, and I am sure that has been heard by those who are responsible.

The court -- forecast for the current year was 8 million, with the aim to reduce Coffee shops have increased around  much to their dismay of my constituency. Can he comment on reducing the cost of the House of Commons?We are looking to reduce the cost forever that is  They have been changes in the way we operate that make turnover more difficult. At the key point of gross profit, the profit made by the Houses... It is the other costs and the staffing required for that that puts us over into subsidy and that is the area can do tackled by the business improvement plan. Should we not always think of the 12,000 or more householders beyond the number of Members of Parliament, many of whom are on lower salaries, that it is perfectly in order to think of an element of subsidy. Some of those extra people include journalists who work in this House and therefore in trying to be prudent in bringing down the costs of the catering service, we should bear in mind that it is quite normal in many places of work for there to be an element of subsidy? It is worth noticing that the gross profit made in the dining rooms is at the high end of the scale and extremely comparable to high-street restaurants. The subsidy is far more in the canteens which are enjoyed by pass holders on far more modest salaries.

In terms of whose signing up, the most important sign up was Marta  which demonstrates that across the country the Prime Minister's speech on the future of our relationship with the European Union was a game changer. We have not been able to give her and her colleagues time for an opposition day debate because we are making progress with legislation, but when she has that opportunity, there are so many things to choose from. The opportunity to debate the increase in employment, last year was the fastest rate employment sector has seen in the 1980s, and the Secretary of State for Health could perhaps come here and debate the reduction by over 80% of people waiting for operations for over one  He might also debate the weights that patients have to experience under a Labour  She might like to debate the reduction in crime figures and a Home Office context of debate in the reduction of migration announced this morning.

As one of the world's worst kept secrets as the Commonwealth Day falls on 11th  when Commonwealth parliaments are being encouraged to mark the day by a debate on some Commonwealth team, how is it and how can it be that this House is being given no opportunity to have a debate about the Commonwealth, about the proposed charter? I have discussed this with colleagues, and encouraged them to approach the backbench committee. I have announced the business on 11th  and from that point of view, we cannot accommodate a debate that  but in a number of parliaments they are debating the Commonwealth close to that day, and I would encourage my right honourable friend and others to continue to make that approach to the backbench  Following on from the honourable Member's question about Commonwealth Day, we approached the government to ask them to open up Westminster Hall on a Monday afternoon to facilitate the debate, and the government refused it. In the light of that, could I ask the Leader of the House whether the backbench business committees full allocation of time will be received from the government before the end of the session, because, by our calculations, we have two provisional day's big tin and nothing more on the horizon which falls one day short. So far we have 13 important and very urgent debates that need to rescheduled from Bass -- backbenchers. The standing orders only provide for Westminster Hall to be opened for particular purposes, and I did not think it was appropriate for us to depart from that in this instance. She asked about the time available.  taking the debate into  the backbench business committee will have schedule 20 -- 5 days. I am confident we will meet and exceed that.The Leader of the House will know that I raised last week the question of the urgency in Government time to have a debate on the Francis report. I discussed this with the chair man of the backbench business committee, who are entirely degrees with me and others who believe that this is becoming a disgrace that we are not having it is -- a debate on this vital question. There is also the whole question of whether or not David Nicholson should resign. Can we make sure we have a debate as a matter of urgency on the floor of the House? It is the Government's contention that we should have a  but he and his colleagues went to the backbench business committee on 15th January to ask for time on a debate, and it has not been scheduled. We have to remember that this House resolve but the backbench business committee should take responsibility for up a wide range of debates including general  and if we start to reimport an expectation that the government will provide time for a range of such debates, then by extension it will be impossible for us to be able to have the same amount of time allocated. We will have a debate on the France's  discussing how this is to be accomplished at the appropriate  but I will continue to make that general point of principle that the backbench business committee is there in part to enable the House to debate current  as it did in relation to Hillsborough. Can we debate the fact that we are all in it together, so we can contrast fuel poverty which affects so many constituents with the handover of �10 million to the chief executive of British Gas, 3 billion to shareholders and the fact that so much is being done to make life so much more difficult for the people we represent in a House of Commons?The House supported the establishment of the Green Deal which will make an enormous -- an enormous difference. He will know that many companies are providing to 2 million households discounts on their energy bills. The Government is supporting many people over this winter with their winter fuel  In addition, he will be aware that the House has just considered the energy Bill in committee which gives an opportunity when that bill comes forward again to debate many issues relating to energy prices and energy poverty. The Royal Bank of Scotland announced another �5 billion of losses, so I call for a debate on the ongoing losses, some -- as a result of the handling of the problems in 2008.

Can he arranged for the regulations to be debated on the floor of this  but to have a debate on ministerial standards and accountability so that we can discuss how these assurances came to be given by ministers but something different has happened? I just have to say that the regulations are entirely consistent with commitments on statements made by ministers during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act.

I very much congratulate the Government on its recent decision to stop backing up World Bank and IMF loans to Argentina because Buenos Aires has an appalling record of defaulting on international loans. And believably, that country is still a member of the G20 group of nations, despite its appalling economic record and the way it behaves internationally. Can we have a debate on the way G20 membership is decided? He may wish to raise that issue with Foreign Office ministers on Tuesday. I do appreciate what he had to say about the World Bank loans to Argentina. He does understand that the G20 it is an informal institution.

I would like to ask about the the trick -- restrictions that have been put on Hull City supporters travelling to Huddersfield on March 30th to play a football game.

The intent of the motion is clear that it is calling on the UK government to assist in ensuring the abolition of the death penalty in India. Retake the technical point but I think the motion is actually headed, specifically mentioning the death penalty in India. I think it is covered and we want to make it loud and clear through the Punjabi community that that is the principal burden of my remarks. It follows in to a tradition of governments of all political complexions in recent years and the representations that has been made to the Indian government. This is an historic debate. But to be frank it would not be taking place today if it had not been for the dedication and hard work of the campaigners. I just wish to pay tribute to them for their hard work. Last year when we received the first inkling that India was considering ending its eighth year moratorium on implementing the death penalty, members of the Punjabi community in our country came together and launched this  Since then they have secured over 100,000 names on their petition to abolish the death penalty and to address other human rights concerns. There are a large number of members of the Sikh community in Huddersfield that passionately agreed with the motion in front of the House this morning. I congratulate my Honourable Friend in securing this debate. Sport 8 years we all hoped and felt that we would have no more capital punishment in India. And of course the record in the United States is far worse in terms of capital punishment. But this is an important debate and I am pleased to give it my full support. A finger across the house we're all friends on this matter. Just to remind people of the campaign, it organised a mass lobby of Parliament last year in the autumn. It has worked with over a human rights organisations such as Amnesty International to press the Indian government for the abolition of the death penalty. On behalf of the whole house I would like to thank all those campaigners who complained in this period of time and many of them have joined as The Sikh temples in Derby that I will visit on Sunday to pick up the good dish and to bring to this -- to pick up the petition to bring this to the chamber, it has captured the imagination in our  I congratulate him on securing this debate.When we visit the men and women who supported this campaign, and also the young people could joined in, I it raised the death penalty and human rights abuses in India last year in this  We do so today with an even greater sense of urgency. That is because India has begun to execute people again. When India secured its independence from Britain it retained its 19th century penal code including the death penalty  Up until the 1980s capital punishment was implement it  But from then on although death sentences were pronounced by Indian courts, they were increasingly not executed, not put into practice. In 1980 the Indian Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty should be used in the rarest of rare cases. This led to eventually an eight year moratorium on any death penalty being implemented within India itself. Like my Honourable Friend, we have a large Punjabi community in Coventry and they are very concerned about the death penalty. The British government should be encouraging the Indian government to honour and signed international treaties against the death penalty. And more importantly, we have seen through the media businesses where the police force have investigated serious crime against women and not taken it very seriously. Last night I presented a petition on behalf of the Punjabi community and nationally as well. I have to say that over the years he has been involved in this campaign. What is interesting in this debate is that although we focused on the death  what has emerged now are these extra judicial killings that have unfortunately gone on as well. He referred to the fact that very recently the Indian authorities have begun to execute people again. Clearly that was in the context of terrorist attacks which caused many lives being lost. By the President has been set and there is now a real danger that many people had previously been given the death sentence but that have not been  but they will now find themselves in a period of great stress and difficulty. This applies to many different communities in  not just the Punjabi community.The eight year moratorium I think lead us into a false sense of security in the  Naive leap many of us thought that although India retained the death penalty on the statute book, the continuation of the moratorium was indication that eventually it would move to abolish the death penalty once and for all. That was unfortunately and naive  Our hopes were lost in the spring of last year when reports emerged that the Indian government was moving towards an  And possibly to authorise the execution of a  This caused widespread concern in the Punjabi community in the UK across many of our constituencies and across the world.

Tragically the German government were assured that he would not face the death penalty and he was returned to India. The German courts have now ruled that that deportation is wrong. He has now been in prison for 18 years, convicted of involvement in an attempted political assassination solely on the basis of a confession which he retracted. With not one in over 100 witnesses identifying him at the scene. And on a split decision by the Court judges. The practice of the courts in India is not to impose the death penalty on a split judgment. But he has been sentenced to death and held for eight years in solitary confinement. Despite his deteriorating health his plea for mercy has been  Despite a further addition to the Supreme Court the idea is that the Indian authorities could move to execute him at any  This is a shocking miscarriage of justice waiting to happen unless we can intervene  The fears for these two men prompted the campaign last  Fears that would confound it won on 21st November last year it India ended its moratorium on the death penalty and executed a man.

And also the ongoing abuses experienced in recent times. The evidence of torture in police cells and deaths in custody. These are also experienced by other communities. People should understand the Sikh and Punjabi culture. In the time when the Sikh mission was established, one of the Golden Temple was founded, the Sikh religion instilled in the Punjabi culture a profound respect for human life. Sikhs are always betrayed us... When there was a Punjabi independent nation, the death penalty was not a feature of their law or government system. There was nobody put to death during that period. The tradition of abhorrence of the death penalty and respect for life is reflected under this petition calling for the abolition of the death penalty. In  what can we do to bring about the reform? We need to recognise the historical relationship between India and Britain means that the UK government is uniquely placed to urge the Indian government to end the death party. I am calling upon the UK government to use every  every mechanism of communication established with  formal and informal, to press the Indian government to hold the executions now and to sign up to the UN Convention opposing the death penalty. I wrote to the Prime Minister before his recent visit to India to urge him to raise the issue and I hope the Minister can report back on that today. The continuing pressure successive governments across party have been putting on the Indian government. I urge the government to raise it again with our European partners. I urged the other... I urge the government to place this back on the UN agenda. My final words are addressed to the Indian government.

May I congratulate the honourable gentleman for this timely debate? I would like to start by paying tribute to the Sikh community in my constituency. I have regular interaction with not only ordinary  as it were, but also the senior leadership of the Sikh community and I find the interaction and dialogue helpful. Not least in being able to rise today to support this campaign. I think as we head towards the heads of government and other important meetings where India are sat around  it is timely that India should be reminded that while it is both very large democracy, a growing economy, seeing an expansion in so many areas, not least its military, the majority of democracies is not just inhabit an army or the economy is or the  but how we democracy treats its minorities. I think India certainly has an issue if not in reality a perception issue of how it does treat its minorities not least Sikhs and other religious faiths including the Christian  While the federal government may express its own concerns and its commitment to religious freedom and religious freedom of speech, it is important the states themselves do not describe powers and to themselves which inhibit and restrict freedom  I have no hesitation in supporting this campaign. I declare an interest in that I am elected chairman of parliamentarians for global action, and one of the purposes of that group, and I encourage all members to join, is to see the ratification of the statute for the International Criminal Court. I declare an interest in that I was recently in Rome with other parliamentarians with other representations from other international bodies, not least the International Criminal Court itself, discussing this very  I think it is also important that India recognises that while it has medium-term United Nations ambitions for a bigger seat at the  it needs to ensure that it abides by the UN Charter Against  degrading and inhumane  I think it would be a big mistake for India to think it can continue to start with more gusto executing prisoners without the international community ensuring that the spotlight is put .. I think it would be unfortunate when so many positive things are happening in that  in that democracy, that there should be this unhelpful and I think retrograde distraction for that country. I will keep my remarks very brief in order to allow other colleagues to speak. I would just conclude by saying that India is a close friend of the UK and friends can be candid. As a candid friend of India, I think cross-party we are saying to that wonderful and beautiful and proud  it is not in India's own interests but to bring back in great numbers the death penalty. There is a debate to be had about the speed in which the federal government may move towards outlawry and execution. It cannot be done overnight, it has to be done in consultation with other states and have cross-party support. That is not going to be an easy  But things worth fighting for are not necessarily easy. I hope the message sent from this House today is that this Parliament is a close friend of the Indian Parliament but I hope our Parliamentary colleagues in India would ensured that the death penalty does cease and I paid I congratulate my Honourable Friend for his securing this debate on the abolition of the death penalty in  It is a warm relationship between the UK and India. India has been as sovereign independent state for 65 years. Let us be clear that no other government can't tell the Indian government what the Indian parliament can do. It is a sovereign state with its own elected parliament and its own judicial system. The modern relationship between the UK and India and is one of equals, one of mutual respect between the two countries with a great deal of interaction in terms of trade, education and culture. It is in that spirit of friendship and mutual respect of this debate takes  Many thousands of my constituents are originate from the  Other born in the Punjab or have parents or grandparents who were born in the Punjab.

I was honoured to be able to pay a pilgrimage to the Golden Temple, the spiritual home of the Sikh community throughout the world. That is an experience I will never  Soak relations between our two countries are good. But the reason we are debating this issue today is because of grave concerns held by the large population of Indian origin here in the UK. Many thousands of whom I have the honour of representing. This petition has been signed by tens of thousands of people throughout the UK. Some of those signatures were presented to Number 10 Downing Street in  And I was pleased to be able to speak in the lobby that they do express my support for this campaign to abolish the death penalty in India. The campaign has arisen from the very grave concerns of the thousands of people who has signed that petition. And the Indian population and the Sikh population in particular in the UK about a number of issues in India. The concerns are focused on the treatment of some members of the Sikh community there. There also  And they also focus on the services of deaths which have been passed on Sikhs. It is these issues which the campaign seeks to draw  The Sikh community in  The Sikh community in community and plays a positive role in our national life. It works hard, respects faith and family and contributes a great deal to the UK. I'm honoured to represent many thousands of Sikhs. It is absolutely within their rights and our rights to take up issues of concern to our constituents. The Sikh community in the city I represent in Wolverhampton and many other parts of the country are very concerned about these issues. Particular attention has been drawn to the cases outlined by my Honourable Friend. Let me be clear, I do not seek to be the judge and jury in their case or in any other  It is a matter for the courts to determine guilt or  But I do believe there are certain principles which are important to establish and which we can speak up for. The first is that justice should be carried out in a fair and transparent way. If facts are disputed there should be proper investigations with results that can be trusted. Too often that is not the case. Many of my constituents do not feel this has happened with some of these cases and many of them do not feel it has happened over the wider events of  They do not believe that the various commissions would have been launched have got to the truce. And launched have got to the truce. And launched have got to the truce. And or power they may hold in society. And I also believe that this country is right to seize the use of the death penalty as it did many years ago and we should seek to end its use in other countries and we should have a fundamental concern not only about the death penalty in India but wherever it is used around the world. Amnesty International reports on their website that in 2011 some 20 States used the death penalty, down from a figure of around 30 a decade before. This is progress, a declining number of states are using it, but it is still used too often and into  India's own Supreme Court said in 1980 that the death penalty should only be used in the rarest of the rare cases. Yet the death sentence since that time has been regularly passed by courts. And in the past decade around 140 death sentences have been passed  So this is still a campaign which goes on. I stand here respecting fully India's  Indeed as a friend of India I hope that in the it will think again about the use of the death penalty and joined the ranks of the nation's which have abolished it. I hope that that  I hope it is their decision it's really taken by India. And if that happens it would be welcomed throughout the world. First of all I congratulate the First of all I congratulate the this debate today. We have heard from the Honourable Members from Wolverhampton areas. And I look forward to hearing contributions from other Honourable Members from both sides of the house. Let me state from the outset that the government strongly supports the worldwide abolition of the death  We believe it undermines human dignity. But there is no conclusive evidence of its deterrent value. And that any miscarriage of justice leading to its imposition is both irreversible and irreparable. It is for these reasons that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supports projects throughout the world by those campaigning against the death  We continued to work actively towards global abolition in line with our strategy for the abolition of the death penalty by raising the issue bilaterally and through the European Union and United Nations. I believe we are United Nations. I believe we are It is important to remember the impact that such acts of terrorism have on the people of India. During part of my recent visit, I was in a hotel in on by, one of the targets of the 2008 attacks where at least 31 people were killed. The Prime Minister visited the Memorial and the police memorials commemorating the victims of the attacks. It was brought home to me too when exactly a week ago I was still India 14 people were killed in a bomb attack in another town. Having spent three days would my right honourable  the Prime Minister, seeing the optimism and opportunities across India, these attacks are a shocking reminder of the terrorist threat that we all face. This is why we are working more closely than ever with our colleagues in the Indian government to combat A I agreed with his remarks about the impact of terrorism. But you referred to his visit with the Prime Minister. Did our government Prime Minister. Did our government As you would expect, they listen to what I had to say. They were aware of our position on this and they stressed to me that the very real fear in India created by these acts of terrorism. The motion... I am very grateful. Could I press him on the consequences for the UK if for example there is a terrorism suspect from India who is in the UK, if India moves forward with  what would the UK government's position be on ratified the United Nations Convention against torture. We should encourage countries like India to sign and implement the United Nations Convention Against  Not only does the convention divine what is meant by the act of torture, it also obliges countries to take measures to prevent acts of torture. Mergers like legislating to make it a criminal offence. Educating officials on the provision of  conducting from the investigations where they are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has taken place and providing redress and compensation  The optional protocol provides an important additional rare of monitoring and reporting to prevent torture from happening in any place of detention. By allowing any place of detention. By allowing continue to call on the Indian government to expedite the ratification of the United Nations Convention against torture and its Optional Protocol. There was a specific recommendation made on this in May of last year. The European Union delegation has also hosted a number of events on the portance of ratifying the India does not see ratification as  The British Government is a strong supporter of the ICC and we actively promote universal ratification. We believe it is in all of our interests to support the ICC to prevent devastating and irreparable damage caused by the most serious crimes and the international community and extend protection it offers two sons and state parties. Concerns have been raised about the treatment of the Sikh community in India. I must say how proud and privileged I felt to visit the Golden Temple would my right honourable friend the Prime Minister last week. I understand it is the first time that a Prime Minister of the UK has ever visited the Golden Temple. Spending time in the gardens of remembrance was a particular moving experience for us  During my visit, I heard about the prominent role and contribution of the Sikh community in India. The head of the Indian Planning Department there is a Sikh. Sikhs are prominent in the security  The Indian Prime Minister himself is a Sikh. Members from both sides of the House need no reminding from the of the respective and thriving Sikh to the nitty in the UK which has a long and proud history -- Sikh community.  Can I also congratulate my honourable friend along with other colleagues who have secured this debate today? He and I have campaigned over the decades for the rights of the Sikh community. Sometimes to the site astonishment of some of our colleagues that we can work so well together -- so like astonishment. I was with him in December presenting the petition in Downing Street along with other  And representatives from the community and also from Amnesty International who have played such a prominent role in several campaigns in support of human rights in India and particularly for the Sikh community. Like him, can I join him in particularly congratulating Kesri Lehar on the success of this petition which has attracted considerable support? As my honourable friend and neighbour pointed out, not only among the Sikh community, but much more  It has also secured considerable publicity for the worthy cause. Many of those from the community are here in Westminster today to observe the debate and also to show their support for this campaign. Let us be quite frank, securing a 100,000 names on a petition requires a huge amount of work and organisation. Our appreciation of this effort by Kesri Lehar should be properly  Both the members, his constituency and mind, both have substantial Sikh populations, many  third and even 4th  We should record that in the last year we have lost two members of that community here in  The MP for Bradford West and my great friend, Lord King of West Bromwich, previously leader of my council which... I would like to pay tribute to them both today. Within the Sikh community, there is today an overwhelming concern about regression in the Punjab and the rights of those living there. This feeling was particularly strong in the difficult years of the emergency following the storming of the Golden Temple in the operation and the murder of Indira Gandhi. There were a host of atrocities that that time with the widespread abuse of human rights, much loss of  of rape and torture, as well as those who disappeared with their families having no idea as to their  And they feel they can never have closure until they know what happened to their loved ones. We know from the history of Ireland had devastating that can be. There was a significant increase in tension last year. The concern was reflected here when it was believed that Professor Bhullar and Ranjit Singh Rana would be executed and the authorities had instituted a major crackdown. That concern manifested itself most visibly in the sea of orange flags across the Midlands showing solidarity with their fellow Sikhs and expressing their real concern at beefier being expressed in the Punjab. They very moderate figure by no means hostile  he described very graphic play the very real concerns of those in his community, Lord King. More recently, but concern has resurfaced with concern about the case of a man being hanged, especially following day regret what end of the informal moratorium and two recent executions. And the Minister will know of the concern in the Kashmiri community as to whether they received adequate representation at their trials. Let me be quite clear. As a previous armed forces and build an Ireland  let me make it absolutely clear our opposition to terrorism. Along with other countries, India has suffered grievously from  The Minister rightly drew attention to the atrocities. The execution of Ranjit Singh Rana and Professor Bhullar and others would not end terrorism but would damage the reputation of India with a major role in the world. The number has rightly identified the concerns of the German courts about the decision to deport Professor  I would in this instance give the Honourable Minister the opportunity to expand on his reply it to the Member for Bedford because my understanding of long- standing consistent policy of the British Government and are all parties is that we will not deport someone to another country where there is a risk of them being  I offer the Minister the opportunity to clarify that for the benefit of the Member for Bedford and for the House. I have to say that we have no standing extradition treaty with India and I repeat what we said. We would look upon it on a case-by-case basis. I sound slightly astonished, I have  As I understood it, and I think I am getting support... The previous chairman of the foreign affairs select committee is seeking  Is it not a fact that in cases where countries do have the death penalty, for example the  the British Government would always have to seek an assurance that the death penalty would not apply it otherwise the courts in this country would never allow anyone to be extradited to any other country where there was a danger of the risk of the death penalty? In many years, the Home Office has had problems getting be glad of this country because of the bad human rights records of many other countries around the world. - - getting rid of people.That is exactly my understanding. I think it is very useful that has been made clear here today. During his recent visit to India, he raised his concern, but can he also clarify for us I would hope that the concerns were expressed to the Indian authorities by others on the visit and also by the Foreign Office elsewhere? And worthy concerns also raised by the Prime Minister himself -- and worthy concerns? As the Member for Wolverhampton South East has rightly stated, the number of countries using the death penalty has gone down. Her as the Minister  two thirds of the world have already either formally or in effect renounced the death penalty. That commitment of countries around the world was shown quite clearly by the voter the UN on a moratorium. It would be a significant step for India as a major player on the international scene for them as the world's largest democracy through not just reinstate the moratorium and to do it formally... But of course would be very welcome. But also to abolish the death penalty. India is poised to play a major role in world affairs, such a move would considerably enhance its Thank you. May I ask the honourable gentleman whether he has any knowledge of what Indian public opinion feels about this matter? Whether public opinion in India wants to the death penalty to be abolished which of course would be a major influence on government there? I do not have the polling immediately to hand. But I think it is quite clear from debates that took place in this country and after all it took us a long while to come round to that decision and no government or party has sought to turn the clock back. It is very clear particularly when the death penalty in its finality never allows for the prospect of error... And also the possibility that a confession might be obtained by duress or torture... People who have been released because they had been unjustly convicted, they would in previous times been executed. I think that starts to come through to public opinion and it is in  quite apart from the other aspects of the death penalty, the finality and the inability to remedy the injustices that I think is the reason why two-thirds of the countries around the world have taken the absolutely correct  As has been stressed, there has been a continuing theme of British policy under this and previous governments, not only to abolish the death penalty in the UK, but to campaign against the death penalty in all countries around the  including in our great alive  I think the comments of the Member for a for South are absolutely right. Even in spite of our very strong relationship with the United States, we still demand absolute assurances from the US if a case could attract the death penalty that the federal authorities will guarantee that would not be the case. I congratulate Ministers for not only the general campaign they have been running but also their representations over the specific cases of Ranjit Singh Rana and Professor Bhullar and I thank the Minister for his recent letter on this which makes clear the actions they have been taking. Not just  but more recently. While the death penalty issue is hugely important and has obviously played a significant part in this debate, it is clearly not the only issue of concern generally in the community or for the petitioners. I am pleased the UK are active in encouraging the improvement of treatment of minority communities. My honourable friend has been campaigning for a long time on this  We understand the British High Commission has discussed minority rights issues with the international community and I hope we are making some progress on that. I am pleased also that the Minister made the strong case for India along with other countries to sign and ratify the treaty setting up the International Criminal Court, another laudable aim of this  and I hope the government are starting to have some success I hope that the Minister will be able at a future date to report progress on these discussions with the Indian authorities, and also to let us know when the next meeting will take place, and also what progress we are making about India's security legislation and the report of a significant number of cases of torture by police and security authorities, and what progress is being made to encourage in yet not all later ratified the Convention against torture, but also adopt a robust legislation to  I would like to once again congratulate the Kesri Lehar  uniting the community would ever there could use may be, and also getting a very wide range of views are being heard. -- often I would like to can -- rejoin Alex in congratulating the Honourable Member for securing this debate. This has been an important petition. I would like to meet the point -- make the point that this is an issue that we should all embrace as an issue of importance in the United Kingdom. If I could draw your memories back to the Olympics  it celebrated what was great about our multicultural  There was a bit that says, this is for everyone, and interconnected this was spoken about in modern-day society. One of the things that makes our country so unique and special is that we can draw on people's experiences from their origins all around the  Mr Deputy Speaker, we do so in a spirit of humility, because we are talking about the legislation and the rules of a sovereign  We need to be extremely respectful and humble in the representations that remake here  but also to carry that to termination -- determination of conviction from our own experiences of the death penalty in the UK. Politicians here worked on a point of practicality and principle to abolish the death penalty in the UK. The Honourable Gentleman makes a good point. According to one  Western Europe is now the safest place to live in human history in terms of person on prison violence. It is a society where there is a complete absence of the death penalty. There are other places in the world where they are demanding that people  The Honourable Gentleman makes the point more eloquently  This is also a matter of practical impact. -- and than  There are so negative consequences that can happen, where the death penalty can exacerbate  and criminal activity can be stimulated as a response to  I would like to make a couple of points that perhaps go a little bit further in terms are representations to our friends in  and that his first of all to  although a moratorium is  the content should be outright abolition, and that is because history teacher at -- it teaches us that moratorium has are not always an effective long-term  India has had an moratorium and has ended that moratorium. We also have the experience of the United States, where the Supreme Court issued a moratorium in the United States and then that went away, and the former President of the United States, before he came President, became one of the most excited and active executioners under people -- of people under the US criminal code when he was the Governor of Texas. When there is still the option that a moratorium can be ended, it has to be abolished and that modern societies need to achieve if we are to accomplish the practical benefits of the elimination of the death penalty. If you execute  they can very quickly become a martyr, and I think martyrdom by execution is rather  I would prefer to see people punished by staying alive but in  I hate the idea that people can become martyrs, especially when they have done great wrong. A Right Honourable Friend speaks with great experience from his own involvement in dealing with conflict in situations with people within Europe up different religious backgrounds, and how those instances can lead to -- lead to extremism and can create a Marjah situation which exacerbates  -- more to her situation. The death penalty is not a friend. It is an opponent and that healing  As we can see from the people who have brought us this  -- petition, this will exacerbate the conditions with an Indian society rather than working for a better long-term solution  I would also like to enter the human aspect for people who are under the threat of the death  It is inhumane treatment to leave a human being on death row for a large number of years. It is just basically inhumane treatment that someone has to go through the psychological trauma of not knowing if and when their appeal will be  if and when they may be  That is not the mark of a decent society in my view. He mentioned George Bush earlier on in relation to the death penalty. When I was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, we visited Texas, and we visited a prison, and the staff there were largely against the death penalty. But still, there were people who were on death row who had been there for 17 or 18  I agree that that is utterly  I am very grateful for the Honourable Gentleman's support for that point of view. There is also the issue that one of the honourable ladies mentioned earlier on about the issue of rape. The Honourable Lady for Slough mentioned that. There is still the possibility that the death penalty can be applied, and the death penalty may be completely out of order for what is particularly needed at that time, but it is always alluring to politicians to draw on that to say that this is a  Again, a moratorium always leaves that possibility. Abolition take that away. -- take that away. Would he not agree with me that the fact that this appalling episode occurred whilst the death penalty was in existence, and indeed would all of the implementation of that, -- with all of the implementation  they are indeed a reflection of a wider problem that has to have more sophisticated ways of dealing with it than the crude implementation of this particular  The broader point here is that I think there are lessons here for politicians of all countries about the use of the death penalty or the possible use of the death penalty in political discourse. The hard learned lessons in this country are that you end up with a more or effective criminal justice system that is more Fayre. If you go to the point of abolishing the death penalty. There is no stopping point on the way to abolition that can give you the security of those  It has to be outright  If I can back up his argument from history. 800 years  the death penalty was  There was a hen man in every village. An Englishman was 50 times more likely to be killed by a fellow Englishman in a society that had the death penalty than in the modern day one where there is no death penalty.That is an interesting statistic. I am sure it pertains to Scotland! You should have been sorted out. If I could just move on to another issue. I would like to humbly submit this for our friends in India to look at. It shines a light on the operations on the judicial system in general within India. Those of us who have studied the British Empire, one of the things we learn is that the English judicial system is one of the gifts that we gave the world. -  It is a system that many people around the world see as a reliable and trusted friend when they are in conflict situations. There are issues about the Indian judicial system and the issues of the death penalty that exacerbate the concerns about the existence of the death penalty. I mention are ready the implications of at the mount a health and well-being -- I mentioned already the implications of the Mental Health and well-being of prisoners on death row. How are these decisions made? What is the due process that is maintained in a process that is finding itself not capable of dealing with the workload that it already has? Some constituents of mine who have had legal disputes in India have made a point that they have got to go back to deal with it. To put a fine point on it, sometimes that is because there are issues to do with money and the criminal justice  I have no idea whether that  -- in the criminal system. It is interesting that there is that question. For our friends in  being part of this great hope for the World, these are issues that they need to address. The Minister very kindly gave a response about UK relations with India should they move forward with the death penalty. What that would mean in certain circumstances, of course he was right to talk about individual cases being looked at on an individual basis, however, I do think that if India were to become a more regular proponent of the death penalty, an active proponent of the death penalty, that would have very significant... We have so many positive areas in our engagement with India that we want to talk about and we do not want to be having ongoing disputes. My hope is that the British government would look very dimly on any actor addition to India -- extradition to India that would involve someone being given the death penalty, and assurances that the death penalty would not be applied if that were  Mr Speaker, may I just thank again de signers of this petition to bring this issue. It may be of particular concern to some communities, but it is a concern for all of us as part of this Open United Kingdom, and it is an important issue for us in  We need to send the message to our colleagues who said -- sit in the Indian parliament that the issue of the death penalty, often it is the politicians who have to lead public opinion, not the other way around, and they should have the courage to immediately halt executions and step forward to move towards a bright abolition. -- out right It is a very important issue as many members have already stated that we make clear our views about the death penalty in India been at the specific debate and also referred to the death penalty throughout the world still being in  We should stand up to show that we totally disapprove and all nations in the world should abolish the death penalty. It is tragic that India still uses that penalty, being the largest democracy in the  and we know the worst offenders are China, which is not a  and Iran, which executes more people per head of the population than any other nation, that is not a democracy it either. It is sad to me that the United States is the leading democracy that still uses the death penalty. Our purpose debate is to represent the views of our many Sikh, Panjabi citizens in our own constituencies, as well as those who are not of Sikh and or Indian origin to show that we want to see the great nation India abolish the death penalty for good. Many members have given examples as to why that should be the case. I want to pay tribute also to the Kesri Lehar  to those that started the wave for justice petition that many members and honourable friends and I have presented at Number 10 Downing Street before Christmas. That was the start of the process that led us to the debate today. I think we have had some superb contributions. I am sure many members will recall the award- winning 2008 movie where the opening scene in the film was the poor young man being tortured in a police station, an image of what occurs in India and perhaps according to some of the evidence may be accurate. We know that the death penalty is inhuman and  It is irreversible and can be inflicted upon the innocent. It has never been shown to deter crime more effectively than other  Therefore, of course, it should be abolished in India, as in all other countries of the world.

Human rights activists in India are worried this precedent could affect the 500 or so people now on death row in India including political prisoners such as Professor Bhullar. As of 11th  2013, there were 476 convicts on death row in India. I want to mention a little bit more about the case of Professor Bhullar. Although many members have mentioned specifically, I know from my constituents fact this is a real cause celebre of somebody who has been tortured and treated really inhumanely in prison and all for bringing to the attention of the public of his concern about the disappearances of his university  Professor Bhullar is a lecturer at a college. He felt he had to flee India for a safer place in 1994 after the threats to his life and harassment from the police because he brought the issue to the attention of the authorities and  He went to Germany.  he was detained and that the authorities were not convinced  mainly because he had false papers on him. He was deported from Germany on 17th  1995, and handed over to the Indian police. The Indian authorities gave specific assurances through the German authorities that Professor Bhullar had nothing to fear if he was returned to India and that he would not be tortured. However, as we  he was arrested, detained and  Surrey, he was arrested, detained on his arrival and he has now been in prison for over 18 years -- he was tried. Sorry. His mental health has deteriorated and it has now got to a life threatening state. By deporting someone to raid death penalty  Germany violated the UN Convention on Human Rights and remains morally obliged to do all it can to seek the professor's immediate release. Professor Bhullar was examined by a police assigned medical doctor recently. Although highly educated, Professor Bhullar's document is co-signed by him with a thumb print. We know that the case against Professor Bhullar is highly dubious. It is based on information that has not been properly corroborated. The prosecution has offered no corroboration at all. None of the witnesses by the prosecution identified Professor Bhullar. Many witnesses claimed he was not the man they had seen. One prosecution witness informed the court he had no knowledge of the case but he was forced and threatened to provide false statement by the police. But chilly every legal system in the world is based upon prove beyond reasonable doubt -- virtually every legal system.

Another factor is the low ratio of judges per population. This is as low as 12 to 13 per 1 million in India compared with 107 in the US. 75 in  51 in the UK. The high workload encourages delays and adjournments on frivolous grounds. The judges will system including judges and lawyers have developed a vested interest in delays as well as corruption. It promotes a corrosive relationship between the different players. I have been privileged in the last two-and-a- half years to be chair of the all- party Parliamentary Group for British Sikhs.

The death penalty is apparent and it speaks to us no matter what community you are from -- it is abhorrent. There are many arguments for and against the death  some of those have been spoken about today. I do not intend to go on with those. We have all been very well briefed by Amnesty International and others on the situation regarding despite the comments made by the Indian Supreme Court in 1983, despite that, the  nearly 500, of people on death row in India today. Just for the record, it is important to note we do not of course condone the actions of people who illegally take or endanger lives no matter what the cause, but it is vital to highlight the fact the death penalty is wrong and should not be part of any judicial process in any There is the difficult area of one nation criticising another nation.

Would he agree with me on issues like the death penalties in India that it is right that all parliaments are committed to improving human rights throughout the world? Absolutely. The point I was trying to make earlier on it is that if we are trying to make these  we have to be cleaner than clean and make sure that our record is clean so that we can speak with moral authority on these crucial issues that affect so many parts of the world. Congratulations to the Honourable Member and all of the others who secured this debate which I am proud to speak in as the Member of Parliament to probably represents more members of the Sikh community that any of my colleagues.

Thank you. This is precisely the point. If we were to decide on a case-by-case basis as the Minister has rightly  if India goes down this  that or complicate our relationship with India. There is going to be a consequence for our relationship unless the Indian Parliament look at this issue very seriously again and make the changes that members have asked  He absolutely is right. I also wanted to make the point that Germany got to that commitment and we know that commitment is that risk of not being fulfilled in this  That is one of the things I am concerned about and therefore we have to keep pressing on the principle that issue. The principle that issue is that the international human rights standards are not things that can be conveniently negotiated, but they are standards that have to beat at the forefront. I feel that rose strongly as someone who has campaigned very strongly on issues on violence against women -- Byfield that very strongly. I feel it India's response to that horrific case in Delhi has been a failure of understanding.

One of the things that makes that less possible is the existence of the death penalty. We are not just concerned that it  but the way in which it is deployed helps to divide communities in India. It makes the country less safe and stable. It is a worry to me that one of the things that is being brought into this debate is the rights of  ethnic and cast minorities in India which are not sufficiently well protected. One of the reasons why the oversupply have centre has briefings have bought those things into this debate -- those who have sent us briefings... It is because it is the sense that put the death penalty is used to target those campaigning for the minorities. People who, like Professor Bhullar, who have exposed some of these cases, they are being  as it were, for encouraging the others. It seems that we have a responsible to say  as the largest democracy  that we expect you to occupy and promote the standards of  the standards of human rights that we expect, and to recognise that if the death of tea is used in these cases in this way, you risk deepening divisions between ethnic and religious communities in your country. You risk making your country less safe, bless peaceful for all of those who  I believe that if India were to commit to abolition of the death penalty as this motion  it would build its capacity to fulfil its potential as a leader in the South for the developing world, its economy is  If his reputation for respect for democracy and human rights group at the same pace, I think it would play a great role in making the world safer and it would I first joined Amnesty International when I was in  Before I was elected, I remember making representations to governments not to exercise the death penalty around the world. For  this is part of a continuing traditional campaign, and I pay tribute not only to colleagues who have spoken and spoken extremely well, the Right Honourable Gentleman to Warley made a great contribution and our friend from Bedford made a great contribution as well. My friend, the Honourable Friend -- the Honourable Member for Leeds North  whom I travelled with not too  I enjoyed his contribution very much. Several of my colleagues have their names on the motion for today. For some obvious reasons, just as obvious - -- just as some colleagues are not  they've sent their acknowledgement of the petition.

There was a question, a series of  and the Lord's the other week about the death penalty -- in the Lord's the other week about the death penalty. I welcome my friend who has taken part in this debate. I do not want to make a long contribution, but I want to see a couple of things about the logic of the case that we are making to the Indian government, respectful of the parliaments past and present. I would like to take a few suggestions on some ways that we can take things forward. I will not take them today, but they would be appreciated. I understand why countries have the devil -- death  I understand why they have had the death penalty as we did, and I understand the difficulty of moving from having a death penalty to not having a death penalty. It looks like a sign of weakness. It looks like it could make it more likely that people will commit serious offences and get away with  I understand. I understand that in relation to events like those in the 80s in India, connected with the Golden Temple, for example, there is a culture that says that we must not a well -- allow people to get away with activities like  I understand how terrible terrorism is in India as it is in this country, and that people who are involved with and convicted of terrorism are thought to be in need of the Alternate punishment. But I want -- alternates punishment. But I want to share the fact that there was the death penalty in India all the time from independence until  and it did not deter any of those events in the 1980s, didn't deter the recent events. Bomb  killings, revenge killings, assassinations have gone on, as they go on in other countries where the death penalty happens. I thought it was telling that our friend from the Scottish National Party may be point that it is now Europe where predominantly countries do not have the death penalty that is the safest place. There is no linkage between a lack of crime and having the death  Indeed, the evidence as I remembered when I looked most recently in the United States is that those states with the death penalty do not have a lower rate of crime than those states without the death penalty, in general terms, and we have to therefore realise and make that argument. On the question of deterrence, what my Honourable Friend agree with me that the key is identifying who commit the crime rather than the actual punishment? It is, and making sure that justice is being seen to be done, and that justice is done promptly, and that is the next point I want to make. I think it is a real issue for our friends  for the Government of  because just as has ground to a halt in India. It is not just me who says that, it is a bench and the Supreme Court in India who has made the point about how slow the processes are. In January last year, he said that the people's faith in the justice system in India was pulling at an alarming rate. There is a real issue about how India deals with the backlog. It is not unique to India. We have been dealing with that issue in Europe in the Court of Justice in  The Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights. These are real issues. There are things that need to be addressed, and they are things that would change the culture and make sure that people would have more  It is dealing with  which sometimes happens in this country. We have just seen a police officer arrested from the Metropolitan Police for corrupt  I am not trying to pretend that we are perfect, but it needs to be dealt with in places like India where it undermines the democratic values and principles and international credibility, and I absolutely join those colleagues in saying that if India was brave  if at the Prime Minister was brave enough, if the President would accept that they could move to abolishing the death penalty, they could be the leaders in their parts of the world. They could change the culture of smaller  Countries like China, said that people would move on. We could end up with the remaining countries understanding that there is a better way to punish people, a  Not only is it not a deterrent to have the death penalty, but as the Right Honourable Gentleman for Warley said, it is a final solution that all too often has been proven to be wrong, and if there is an injustice done, yes, if someone has been in prison for 20 years as they are wrongly convicted, it is a terrible thing, but at least they can come out and enjoy the rest of their life if there is an injustice. If someone is  it is too late to undo  I want to make the specific case that I did when I was in India most recently for people like the two people who were executed. I want to join my plea to others that the new president of India returns first to the moratorium, which his predecessor Follett, and --  and I would hope that that could be a first stage, and I understand it would have to be an interim stage before abolition. I understand as well that having people on Death Row is a dreadful human punishment as well. Actually, a moratorium is not a good answer. But I hope that we can collectively help India to understand the arguments for moving forward. I have one specific proposal and then I will end with my questions to the  Later this year, there is going to be a conference that will be held in Colombia, which is controversial. I know it has been the subject of discussion and Ministers have been recently to Sri  We have not decided what level of representation we will  I am assuming there will be a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting later this year, whether it is in call -- Sri Lanka or somewhere else. I would like to put on the agenda for that conference the remaining issues of death penalties within the Commonwealth. I would be grateful if they could associate that to see if it is possible to argue that the questions of justice and the speed of justice could be on the agenda. I would be grateful if the Minister would take that to discuss with his  including the Foreign  because I think there is a commonality of interest. I should have said this in the beginning, I do not come to this debate because I have a huge number of Sikh constituents at all. I have no temples in my constituency. I have a large Muslim and Irish community, a large African community, but I do not come to this because I have an interest to do with constituencies, but I do work with minority communities, and I think the Commonwealth needs to step up to the plate and do better and making sure that these issues are on the Commonwealth agenda. I would be grateful if the failures of justice and the death penalty issues might be something we could put on the agenda for this year. Secondly, I would be grateful if Ministers could deflect and replied to as as to how we can be affected immediately and the United Nations Human Rights Committee which is meeting in Geneva at every in next few weeks -- over the next few  I know that Sri Lanka is on the agenda for that committee. I do know -- I do not know quite the scope of the remaining agenda, but maybe we could make sure this issue is addressed there. I think it would be really helpful if we kept these issues on the top of the priority list of the European Union. Not in an old Empire Way, but actually seeking to work with our friends in all countries of the world as well as our friends in the Commonwealth. I would be grateful to know not just that the Minister raised these issues when he was in India with the Prime Minister and the delegation last week, but it would be helpful to know if the issue was raised by the Prime Minister when he met with the Prime Minister of India. If he did not, would he be willing to do that? There are visits on a regular basis and they would allow this to be respectfully but as a point from the UK and the UK government to the Prime Minister of India and his  I would specifically ask Ministers if they might reflect on whether there could be an  not necessarily just by the United Kingdom, but by the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries to seek to ask the Indian government to return to the moratorium whilst the matter is under consideration. I have one last suggestion. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the entire Parliamentary Union can be quite influential on occasions. I think there may be a case for a parliamentary initiative, if I could suggest it and leave it to you to speak to your colleagues, as to whether we might, with other Commonwealth parliaments, seek to either convened a gathering or conference on this matter, could be hosted here or it could be hosted in a country such as India. I think this is a real opportunity for this Parliament, for the Indian government and parliament, and for the Commonwealth to be seen to be taken seriously. I have this debate is not just fighting up our concern to change things but a stepping stone to more practical interventions said that, and the very near future, there can be the sort of changes in the democracy that we are a been to see. -- that we are hoping to see. I am sure that my Honourable Friend would agree that even if that were to  there are many other human rights abuses that are taking place in India which similarly should be There are. I do not want to back away from that at all. When I was with my friends the Honourable Member for Leeds North- East when we went to see the Tibetan community in exile, before that I had been to Punjab, I had been for the first time to an Indian occupied Kashmir, and I had been to the Golden Temple and have the same spiritual experiences. There are big human rights issues. These are jobs for the international community. It is a job for many of us to make sure that democratic governments uphold the standards that we signed up to and that where there are particular documents as referred to in this  such as the Rome statute, which has not been signed by some  and I am grateful for my Honourable Friend's intervention, there is work to be done on this serious matter. Some colleagues might wonder why some of us are here whether it than in Eastleigh. I hope people understand that, of course by-elections are important, but trying to change the patterns of one of our best friends is at least as important. When this  I will go do my duty in  -- when this debate ends. I would like to join other colleagues in congratulating my Honourable Friend for Hayes and Harlington for securing this debate, and to put on my record Mike francs and bride in the Kesri Lehar Campaign -- put on record Mike thanks and bright in the Kesri Lehar Campaign and to congratulate them for their tireless work for human rights for all minorities for  I ago the words of my honourable friends, the Members for Ealing Southall and Wolverhampton  who stated that this is a debate held in the context of our friendship with India and the great regard in which we hold our relationship. This is a matter for the Indian population and the Indian government, but it is a matter in which we also can express our view and those of our constituents. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are many debates in which we participate in this House, but this one is literally a debate about life and death. I have had a long- standing personal opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances, and I am proud to live in a country where the death penalty has been  This is a matter of  and as someone once said, it is not for the state to kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong.

At the time I wrote to the Foreign Secretary and the Indian government, raising concerns of many but -- many in my constituency.

More  the brutal and tragic rape and murder in India at Christmas of a 23-year-old on a bus shows that we must tackle violence against women in India in a far greater weight than has been done  A vigil in support of her and her family was held at a temple in my constituency with concerns raised about the behaviour of the  the scrutiny and transparency and their accountability. Concerns about the police in human rights cases demonstrates the need for reform in the police and the justice system and on this area there is much we can share in the UK it of our experiences to help India on its path to an improved justice system. Two weeks ago, men and women in India also stirred up together as part of her brilliant rising the global campaign to end violence against women and girls -- A brilliant rising. Days like that must not be just a one-day that we prefer for six months and move on straight after. The message has to be kept alive and channelled into all aspects of domestic and international diplomacy. This debate about human rights and standing up for human rights for all in India is another such circumstance in which we can stand up for the rights of women and children and make sure that this voice is heard. It is also of great concern that in the world's largest democracy through some of the circumstances we have seen recently that innocent people suffer and are killed sometimes in the crossfire when peacefully protesting for improved human rights. Last year there was a horrific case which touched us deeply. She was an 18- year-old Sikh College student who won peacefully protesting against capital punishment last March was killed when police opened fire on a crowd of just a few hundred to make them disperse. There are concerns about the level of inquiry that has taken place into how and why that tragedy happened and others were  There are different ways to keep the peace in communities and do policing.

I hope the UK and other governments can now lead a renewed effort to persuade the Indian government and other nations to renounce capital punishment and address the outstanding human rights abuse concerns.

Congratulations to the honourable members for securing this debate about this important issue of human rights and dignity. E-petition has raced an essential debate about the abolition of the death penalty all over the world but for many reasons particularly in India. I have received an abundance of letters and correspondence from my constituents. A majority of them still have strong links with India and are dismayed by its continued use of this as dated, cruel and inhumane punishment. For clarification, I have the highest Sikh community, 21.6%. I have a moral authority to speak on their  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by India recognised the right to be free from subjection of inhuman or degrading punishment. By keeping the death penalty, India goes against these fundamental rights that it has agreed to. It is one of only 53 countries to retain the death penalty and one of the only 20 countries to have applied the death penalty in practice in recent  It cannot be acceptable for a democracy such as India to keep practising this unfair punishment. Will my honourable friend give way?  I congratulate my honourable friend of being the representative of the largest number of Sikh residents in the UK. Would he also agreed the petition that has been presented to me and my colleagues in the Leeds would also add to the pressure on the government of India because it is signed by both Sikhs and others? What he also agree that organisations like the seat Confederation UK can coalesce people around this course and have an extremely loud voice -- Sikh confederation UK. I fully agree with what the member says. We cannot always assume the judicial system is faultless. Therefore using death and irrevocable act as a punishment for a crime because the system at risk of punishing the innocent irreversibly. There have been examples in the past of wrongful executions. It was the case of a man who among others contributed to the evolution of the death penalty in this country after a long campaign -- the abolition. The man was falsely convicted of murdering his wife and infant  Sentenced to capital punishment and hung in 1950. It was three years later that the police discovered multiple bodies in the flat of the downstairs neighbour. The serial killer. They realised their mistake. A person who while at the time of conviction is believed guilty might well be  It is the mark of their  civilised society to not tolerate torture and the death sentence is not an appropriate way to respond to criminality. As the world's largest democracy, India should adhere to this. Every human being has an inalienable right to live and centres in a person to death goes against that principle. The state and the judicial system cannot deprive an individual of the value of their life. Taking the life of an individual is hugely inconsistent with the values that Indian culture prides itself on and  Fairness and equality. Desmond Tutu is believed to have  to take a life when a life has been lost his revenge. It is not justice. I agree. Justice cannot be provided with the death  The justice system cannot proclaim on the one hand to condemn the act of killing and the other hand exact punishment with death. This also establishes an inappropriate link between the state and violence. It brutalises society and legitimises state  It is also important to note that there are still countries that have capital sentences to individuals on the basis of their religious beliefs. We should not tolerate the existence of the death penalty to punish those with different spiritual values or  I would finally like to point out that while there have been much justified concentrations on the recent executions in India  there have also been unfortunately they are growing number of voices in India calling for those men responsible for the brutal attack and rape of the young girl to be hung. I have also spoken many times in this chamber of about my sadness and dismayed... I am heartened to hear of the calls for justice on her behalf. The death penalty is not justice, it is simply revenge. What India needs now is to reform the justice system, to address the many underlying issues which perpetuate this endemic cycle of violence against women and not apply capital punishment to the perpetrators. I would encourage a the Indian government to signed and ratified the statute of the International Criminal Court and the UN Convention against torture and other cruelty, degrading treatment. As the world's largest democracy, India should be a leader in the Defence of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights and abolish the death penalty which takes its long .. I am grateful for the number of members who have made such valid and I think thought for contributions today. I know many have been dragged down for the by- election to pester constituents with no effect whatsoever. Nevertheless, I am grateful for those who have come today because it has demonstrated that this House speaks with one voice on this matter and that is the plea to India to and the implementation of the death penalty and move towards its abolition. The tone struck by the Member for Wolverhampton South East and reinforced by other .. We are speaking as friends of India. We recognise and respect the sovereignty of India as an independent state but our historic links give us the opportunity to speak as friends. Honourable members explained the background of the historical human rights abuses that have still not been addressed unfortunately but also how they are being compounded by this threat of the death penalty that hangs over Professor Bhullar and others. The Minister has explained the history of representations the government continues to make. Other members have offered other practical ideas and opportunities that there might be for further interventions to try and see if we can move this issue along to fruition. Again, as all members have done, we thank the Kesri Lehar campaigners who have brought this issue to us and have made this debate fundamentally important in the campaign to save the lives of the individuals but also to end the death penalty once  The last word icing needs to go to one of the family  While we have been in this  a letter came in from relatives of Professor Bhullar. They are saying, they can only pray people are listening and that everyone will do everything they can to stop this inhuman execution to an innocent person and the in terrible miscarriage of justice. We begged the House today, please help Professor Bhullar to be saved from the death penalty. I think that message goes out from all of us. We want to ensure no one else suffers from the death penalty in India and we want to ensure there is a peaceful and harmonious society constructed and that cannot be constructed on the basis of the Could you explain to the member of the House to explain his comment made by that Cornwall councillor who said that when you going to disabled schools you can smell the stench of defeat. He should come to the House and apologise to the people of East Durham. And I can assure you the chair has not been notified from the Secretary of State he will make a statement, but I am sure it is on the record and it will have been noticed. We now come to the backbench Ms -- business motion on the 25th Thank you very much. I stand not from my usual place in this House. I chose to sit next to the Member for Harlow because they today, because I think no one in this Parliament has done more for the cause of the Kurdish people and the recognition of the genocide than the Member for Harlow. Indeed, he cheers that genocide task force in  Mr Deputy Speaker, as the horrors of the Holocaust passed beyond living memory, there is a danger that we drop our guard, but we believe such terrible events are safely sealed in the history books and could never happen again. But the truth is they have already happened again. Genocide did not end with the fall of the Third  This red granita genocide in 000 Bosnian -- sold 000 Bosnians murdered on Mars. In  500,000 people were killed in just 100 days. And between 1960  the campaign of persecution unleashed by Saddam Hussein against his own people, singling out the Kurdish community, sock over one million people disappeared. -- sock over one million people disappear. Most presumed dead, murdered by Government forces. Yet only the first two have been recognised officially as genocide. No International trundled tribunal has been convened -- Criminal Tribunal has been convened. There has been no international campaign to bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice. The British Government has not formally stated that the actions of Saddam Hussein and his lieutenant constituted  -- his lieutenants. That is something that must be put right. Too many people, the plight of the Kurds in Iraq remains unknown. The  the interment tanks - - internment camps, they gassings, the mass graves - these are images that take us to the darkest depths of the 1940s, not the 1980s. Yet Saddam Hussein and the Ba'athist regime carried out these actions. The Iraqi Kurds endured demonisation, removal and death. So-called men of battle age, a definition that included tall, strong boys as young as 12, were  and thousands of women and children vanished. Strong evidence shows that many were taken to internment camps where they were executed or died from malnutrition and portraits. When Coalition forces entered Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction, they instead found mass graves and thousands of bodies that they were  Men, women and children, all killed for nothing other than their ethnicity, their bodies hidden from the eyes of the world. This year is the 25th anniversary of the final act in this  the al-Anfal Campaign, literally translated as the spoils  This last and best known phase took place in 1990 -- 1988, 000 people died. 182,000 men, women and children, systematically  all in all over 2,000 Kurdish villages and towns  One town, along with its 000 inhabitants, was literally wiped off the match if -- wiped off  This is enough people to fill Wembley Stadium twice over.

On March 16th,  Iraqi planes bombed the town of Halabja with mustard gas and some suspect other nerve agents, such as Sarin gas. 5,000 civilians died in incredible agony that day, and estimates suggest a further 000 were injured or suffered long-term illness. For years  many babies were born with deformities, and even today, if you visit Halabja, as I have  you will see a mass grave sites and the basement of bombed- out buildings remain contaminated - - contaminated. For me, the events hold a personal significance. I am proud to be the first British MP of Kurdish dissent. It was because it -- persecution of the Kurdish people that brought my family to the safe haven of Great Britain. As an eight-year-old boy, I remember standing with my mother at Baghdad international airport, watching my father attempt to flee that country, boarding a plane for the safe haven  The night before, he had been tipped off the regime was planning on coming for him. As the plane taxied towards the runway, we watched in horror as an army vehicle stopped the plane and soldiers boarded it. It was only later that we discovered they had taken the man sitting next to him.  Mr Deputy Speaker, was the life of a Kurdish family in Iraq, waiting for a knock on the door in the middle of the night, knowing they could be coming for you, living in fear. In 1988, as news of Halabja reached the Kurdish community overseas, we all waited for the media to take notice. In a box in my attic and have some of the first photographs to get out of  They are, as you can imagine Mr Deputy Speaker,  get Saddam Hussein's spin machine had gone into  No Gas had been used,  and the first western journalists did not visit the area until of lobbied later. What confronted them was truly terrible. Writing in the Guardian, David Hirst described the scene. This is what he said.

There are old man Shields and infant from he cannot have known  Even after that, there was still scepticism from many. Yet this was just as the culmination of a decade-long campaign against the Kurdish people, the final stage of the regime's attempts to wipe out the Kurdish people in Iraq. Saddam Hussein had unleashed all the resources of a modern, industrialised state on the Kurdish population of his own country. His forces used chemical weapons, concentration camps and aerial bombardment - all methods last seen during the Second World War. If it was not genocide, Mr Deputy Speaker,  one has to ask, would it be? -- then a what. The crime of genocide was brought into law to prosecute those on trial at  The word comes from the Greek for race and Latin for  The literal meaning is  but legally it requires the aggressor to have pre-planned the destruction of a national group. In their investigation, Human Rights Watch is clear this was the case, and they stated this, that this crime far transcended the legitimate counter insurgency and includes the murder and disappearance of tens of thousands of non-combatants due to their ethnic national identity. The fact that some of these atrocities took place during the Iran her up -- Iran-Iraq war or during a time of uprising have led some to argue they were war crimes or crimes against humanity. I disagree. There is no doubt there were atrocities committed in conflict, but what occured in Kurdistan, the mass killings of civilians, women and  was not a conflict. One side could not and did not fight  Nor was it random violence. It was the planned destruction of the Kurdish population. Prior to asking for this debate, I lunched and online petition calling for the Government to recognise formally the genocide against the people of Iraqi Kurdistan. As of this morning, it had nearly 20,000 signatures and 000 signatures it received a response from the Government. The Government stated this - it remains the Government's view that it is not for the Government to decide whether a genocide has been committed in this case as this is a complex legal question where international judicial bodies find a crime to have been genocide this will often play an important part in whether we will recognise one as  Yet, without international  it is unlikely an international judicial body will begin a prosecution in order to provide that important part that the Government requires. Then there is also the fact that many of those responsible, including Saddam Hussein himself, were tried and executed for other crimes before an international court could intervene on the question of genocide.  in March 2010, the Iraqi Supreme Court ruled the operations of 1988 where genocide. This was four years after Saddam Hussein was executed for crimes against  There is no doubt now that he should also have stood trial for genocide, as well. I apologise for being a couple of minutes late for the start of his  I think the case he is making is very strong. Is it not alter the fact that some other countries' Parliaments have already set in their opinion that there was a genocide and therefore the position the British Government is taking it needs to be reconsidered? I fight my honourable friend for that intervention. He is absolutely  -- I thank my honourable  Not just Norway, there are other countries, as well. The Iraqi Supreme Court ruled the operation  Earlier this year, the Norwegian Government recognised the al-Anfal Campaign as genocide, stating that the judgment in Iraq in accordance with international law justified his decision. Sweden then followed with the Swedish Parliament stating that, based on  statements from organisations and the 2010 judgment  it was legally able to make this declaration - in the Netherlands we have even seen a Dutch citizen successfully prosecuted for his part in this  He was tried at the Hague  among star the things, with selling chemicals knowing they were going to be used for genocidal  Such a charge required the court to decide whether or not the al-Anfal Campaign was indeed  And surprisingly, they agreed it was. There exists a judicial decision in Iraq, a decision at the Hague and the decisions of other nations stating their support for the genocide that was committed against the Kurdish  The United Kingdom can act and make it clear to the world that this Government recognises the genocide committed against the Kurdish people. Mr Deputy Speaker, beyond the legal arguments, there is another important dimension. Around the world, the UK carries enormous moral weight. I am proud that Britain is at the forefront of the international community when it comes to protecting human rights and standing up to regimes that threaten their people and  That is why we must be Can I congratulate the honourable gentleman and stand shoulder to shoulder with him with his desire to see this recognised as genocide? In relation to the point here is just making, he with almost 38 million Kurdish people across Syria,  Iran and Turkey, does he also thanked that this fosters the position of Kurdish people today? Does he also believe with tremendous concern at the position of Kurdish people in Turkey at the moment that it is important we get closure on the horrific crimes against them. If this Parliament today recognises this as Genoa side. It would send a clear message to all those countries who may at some point be tempted to attack their own people for their ethnicity, to certainly think twice about that.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the operation against the Kurds. It is also the 30th anniversary of the killing of the 8000 members of a clown. These are not seriously challenged.

But sustained contact with the outside world only began over the -- after the 2003 invasion.

And later, with my honourable friend for Basildon  we went to see some of these graves. It has left a marked impression on me since. It sums up why we have to recognise Saddam Hussein's genocide on the Kurdish people as exactly that. We know that the actions of the Iraqi regime from the 1960s until 2003 were a sustained campaign of genocide against the Kurdish people. We must not make the mistake of thinking everything started in 1988 with the al-Anfal Campaign.  if it was not for enlightenment and the military  first from John Major and later from Tony Blair, that this final solution of the extermination of the Kurdish people would have been successful. Thirdly, recognition for the genocide, for the Kurdish people, is important, not just because it is morally  but it is a warning to tyrants around the world and helps the survivors to fight for justice in the international criminal  Let me explain what I mean. A published -- Polish lawyer who coined the word genocide wrote in  as a co-ordinated plan of different actions in mind at the destruction of the essential foundations of the life of national groups with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. That is a perfect description of the campaign of persecution and murders which Saddam Hussein and his predecessor's lead against the Kurdish people. They were repeatedly attacked by the Iraqi military from 1960 until 1970. In  Iraq published late at -- publicly announced peace plans for the World for Kurdish autonomy, but privately they started an aggressive campaign in the oil-rich regions of Kurdistan, forcibly removing people and seizing their  In 1974, Iraq then began a new bombardment against them. In  Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers accord, cutting humanitarian supplies to Kurdistan. Over the next three years, 200,000 Kurdish people were forcibly deported to other parts of Iraq. During the Iran-Iraq war in the  the regime implemented anti- Kurdish policies, pogroms, in  and a civil war broke out. Iraq was condemned but never seriously punished. The result was the genocide be accelerated. First the Kurdish people were demonised, then marginalised, then persecuted, and finally they were massacred. All of the stages of genocide. Between 1986 and 1989, the al-Anfal Campaign led to the destruction of 000 villages and towns and the murder of more than 180,000 Kurdish civilians. That was the cold-blooded use of ground offences, internment without trial, disappearances, aerial bombing, torture and rape as a weapon of war, destruction of villages and towns, mass deportations, firing squads and chemical attacks, including the inhuman attack on the Kurdish town as so movingly described by my honourable friend for Stratford, of Halabja in 1988, that killed 5,000 people almost instantly.

I know there is always a debate about definitions, but the al-Anfal Campaign was the murder of 182,000 people and the displacement of 1.5 million, just because they were Kurdish. How is this any different, for example, from the 1995 massacres of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica? Which has been ruled to be a genocide by the International Court. How is it different from Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of Tutsis died in 1994, which the UN recognises as genocide? How is it different from Darfur, where the International Court issued an arrest warrant for the President of Cezanne at -- Sudan after 300,000 were murdered and millions displaced? Yugoslavia, Rwanda, they were recognised formally by the UN as having had genocides. The US Secretary of State : Powell said that the massacres in Darfur where  Since that time, however, no other permanent of the UN Security has followed suit. I accept the Minister will feel hindered by definitions, but to the man in the street, how are the scientific murders of Darfur, or  or what happened in the former Yugoslavia any different from what happened in Kurdistan? In  the United General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention of punishment for the crime of genocide, and legally defined the crime as, any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy it in whole or in parks and national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such, killing members of a group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group's conditions of life, calculated to bring out its physical destruction, and posing members intended to prevent births within the group, or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. That is clear and that convention, and that is exactly what has happened to the Kurdish people in Iraq over the last 50 years. It is worth  too, as my honourable friend nodded, that in December  a court in the Hague ruled the Kurdish people had face genocide in the 1980s. My next point is that what stopped the genocide was actually a NATO intervention, what I have tanned muscular enlightenment. -- what I have described as muscular enlightenment. John Major and his allies established safe havens within Iraqi borders and a no-fly  It is good to see Lord Archer in these parts, who was so instrumental to making that happen.

But the Kurdistan people, despite what they have suffered, have built a democracy, not perfect, but a good democracy with a rule of law, property rights, equality towards  religious tolerance and elections - all the requirements that we understand as being the values of freedom. It is no accident that Christians across the rest of Iraq - where the goal when they are being persecuted? They go to Kurdistan, because they know because they will be -- they know they will be treated fairly and  as is right. Finally, we must recognise Saddam Hussein's in the international criminal court. There has been little justice happening to those who cause the Kurdish genocide. Some of the  and the pilots who dropped the chemical weapons, are still at large, and may even be in  Others might also be at  To be fair, Iraq has recognised the genocide, and it must be the duty of the rest of the world to do the same.

We can disagree about United Nations  We will debate for a millennium about whether the Iraq war was justified. What is indisputable is that the removal of Saddam Hussein not only saved the Kurdish people from genocide, but has brought a new independent, and aggressive nation, in the form of  I am a Jewish MP.

But you have it over  The mustard gas reminds me of it all too clearly. If we are to make this more than just a slogan, we really have too mean it.

Of course, the charge of genocide was proved in the tribunal in Iraq, when many prominent Iraqis were tried. One man was sentenced to death, he was known as chemical Ali. The charge of genocide was made against him. It was proved against him.

I remember during my visit to Kurdistan hearing again and again about the  seeing first hand the visible signs of a nation bearing a great burden, and visiting the Memorial Museum my honourable friend for Harlow talked about that now is housed in a form of torture  where many of the worst crimes were committed.

I would also like to pay tribute to my Honourable Friend for her work. Three decades ago, most of us here were not in this  and it was in the background for what was happening in our lives. We were occupied with other things. We probably did not get the recognition at that time. Things may have been different. We may not have been talking about this today. I would like to focus on the impact of what happened back then on real human beings. My interactions with Iraqi people started in 2003, as the president of the biggest trade union in Britain at the time, the TUC, I was completely and are utterly opposed to the invasion of Iraq. I believe that the reasons for going into Iraq were not justified. I believe the argument about weapons of mass destruction not been proved, and I believe that the UN by doing  Nothing should have been done until that work had in  I still remain convinced today that the reason that the leader of my party decided to go into the Iraq was because he passionately believed that Saddam Hussein should be got rid of, and that he wanted to keep good relations with the Americans. I believe the Americans had different  They want to get reason that they get rid of Saddam Hussein. They did get some of the oil wealth in that part of the world, but even more important to the Republican party in America, they wanted to ensure that George Bush got re-elected 80 months after the  I remain convinced that the Americans went into Iraq because it fitted perfectly into their election that was 18 months ahead. After the war had finished, my role was to ask what we would do now. What were the benefits of what had happened included a trade union  It is one of the largest from Europe to Australia. A very active trade union movement, and it had been repressed. We would do our bit to help people to find their role in the world again.

These were comrades. The fact that they were from another part of the world was irrelevant to me. They were standing up for people, trying to develop their skills, so they could develop properly. They said they needed our help to start investing in this country. If they do not invest, they do not have  and they do not have a trade union movement. It is a simple  I meant with -- I met with a number of ministers. That was the first time that I had been exposed what happened. They said very clearly that they thanked us as a nation for what they did for us in  and they thanked us for liberating them in 2003. That was a slap in the face. I saw what happened in 2003 as an invasion. But is all well and good for me to sit in the comfort of the UK, and it was not me who was being wiped off the face of the earth. It was not my village that was being flattened. It was not being my -- it was not my community that was being destroyed. It did not change my mind about why we went in and what it was wrong, but what came very clearly has why on earth did we not do it 20 years before? We had done it 20 years -- have we done it 20 years before, it would have been better, but we were dealing with Saddam Hussein. We were sitting on our hands, supporting the Americans yet again while they, and the rest of the world powers, were happily sitting back watching the Iranians the Iraqis wiping millions of their own citizens out, using them as pawns. We saw the attack on the Kurds happening. We had to  It was a price worth paying so that Saddam Hussein was able to keep the Ayatollah and his acolytes under control. Was it worth it in terms of the international situation? Other people in history  They will look back and see what was happening now and they will realise it was absolutely the wrong thing to do.

But one other thing things that sticks in my mind was in 2006, we were walking out of the red house, and there was  In the reception, there were five Kurdish guards watching  On the TV, live, was the trial of Saddam Hussein. To me, it was real history in the making. For people like me, who did not want us to hold that country, it was a huge wake-up call. What can we do? What He is absolutely right about a way the regime document it did, and on the DVDs referred to earlier, the thing that is most shocking is that the footage of what happened is the footage from the regime, so you are seeing people being shot. One of the most horrific things to me, and why it is more horrific than seeing someone killed I am not quite sure, but was to see a man being held by other man and having his wrist beaten until literally it is broken and you see the person come along at the end and move his hand and there is literally no connection. It is just prickle. Where it really is no excuse for us not to  because this evidence is there. My honourable friend is absolutely  there was never any attempt to pretend it did not happen, the rest of the world's just turned a  that is what we did as an international community. Today we have a chance to make amends for that in a small way, and it is important to do that. I have also visited some of the villages out in  the north-east of the  where people saw their way of life absolutely terminated. Not only did they take the men away from their homes and killed them come in many ways what my honourable friend said about really shocked her - what really shocked me was that a lot of these people were buried alive. They did not even give people the justice of putting a bullet in their brain, they put them in trenches and covered them over. That is how much contempt they had for these people. I visited effectively what had become a concentration camp, where only young men and women wear  and they were being taken away from the agricultural area, the bread basket of Iraq, which is now devastated. The sad thing is, if these young people go back home, they will not know where to start to get their farms up and running because they have lost the contact with the farming industry, because their fathers were taken away and killed 20 years ago, and they have no way to tell them how to do it a. We visited a place in the north of the country, and the elder from that village - apart from the fact he thought I was Gordon Brown, I don't know where he got that idea, I don't know who was more annoyed, me or Gordon! In 1991, he had welcomed the overseas aid agency at  and he remembered the pride felt to help, and it made me proud to be a member of this House, but also frustrated because we had not kept up the work supporting those people. The big questions  was, why did you not help us earlier? I just hope that today's debate will remind us of why we should have done that. I want to read out a letter I have received from a close friend of  who has a trade union leader  someone I am proud to call a comrade who asked me if I would go and visit his mother and  I did not realise it was 5 hours' ride into the mountains at Mac but these people are so proud of what they have banned.

I particularly thanked the Member for Stratford for his speech, and as he points out he is the first Kurdish member of Parliament. We have shared platforms at various events and I have no doubt we will again at -- in the future. I think the way he has put the case for recognition of what was the genocide of the Kurdish people in Iraq in 1988 is very good and I absolutely support what he is seeing and his points. Next month will be the Kurdish New Year, and that will be celebrated across a wide range of communities in this  of course, all over  One hopes we will be able to draw attention to what happened in Iraq in 1988. As the other member has pointed out, she and I were both members of this House at that time, and together we frequently raised the whole issue  and also within the British  Whilst lack of knowledge of much of the public is understandable because of the way in which the media were failing to report things, I think we have to be quite honest about it, that it took an awfully long time for most of the media and most of the political establishment in this country to cotton on to what was really happening to the Kurdish people in Iraq. Quite honestly, a lot of British Government policy was blamed said did because of this obsession with supporting Iraq against Iran in the dreadful Iran- Iraq war and the considerable economic interests Britain had in Iraq at that time, not least oil exploration and exploitation and other issues. I think we have to have a sense of deep self-criticism on that whole process, and not having that sense does us no favours at all. When the news did finally come out about the use of gas - and as the Member for Sheffield pointed out - the way the villagers were bombed first to break the glass for the gas do have maximum effect, it was an absolutely evil piece of work that was done in which a large number of  brilliant people lost  In remembering that genocide here, we have to work out how it happened, how it came about and how to one stops it happening  -- and how to stop it  I want to see a few words about Kurdistan and Kurdish people in general and how to move on from there. There is a sort of complicated narrative in world history of equating nations with nation-states, ethnic communities and languages with nation-states, and it does not always work. At the end of the First World War, which was a seminal point in the whole  germane to the whole history of the region, the Kurdish people had been part of the Ottoman and had a degree of recognition within that, and operated as a Kurdish identity. They took at face value Woodrow Wilson's 14 points as did many other people in the region, including Palestinian people, and assumed they would all have that nationhood as a result of it. A high point of Kurdish recognition was a little bit of a sandwich between the treaty of Lausanne and the treaty of said. We were more interested in the buffer against the Soviet Union and the mandate Britain and France achieved further  and the Kurdish people and their wishes were obliterated. Britain does not have clean hands  We took part in establishing the modern Iraq and indeed the first aerial bombardment of people using chemical weapons was done by Britain in northern Iraq in 1922 against Kurdish people. There is a whole history of obliteration of Kurdish people, their language, their culture and their identity. What Saddam Hussein was doing was the ultimate in oppression of an Asian or a people, but the treatment of Kurdish people in other countries within the region to this very day needs to be  That treatment of Kurdish people in Iran, in Syria and in  I have a very substantial Kurdish population in my constituency, mainly but not all emanating from Turkey, and indeed I have visited most parts of Kurdistan over the years, but I am sad to report that we still do not have full recognition of Kurdish people within modern Turkey, we still do not have modern teaching in all British schools, and I think it is incumbent on us, if Turkey wants to be part of the European  to put a great deal of pressure on them and say you have to give greater recognition, linguistic rights, cultural rights, and all the other things to the Kurdish people in Turkey.

I  Indeed, none of the Kurdish National Movements any  so far as I am aware, call for an independent Kurdistan it with national borders.

I support the resolution before us today. Many have drawn attention to the achievements, as they are, in modern Iraq in the Kurdish region, and I recognised those commended I have visited that region in 1991. I  including many of my  the Iraq war in 2003, not because I was in any sense ever an apologist of any sense for Saddam Hussein, I just believed the motives for the war were not the right ones and thought they were more to do with American military power and will -- mineral resources than anything else, and I thought a lot of people would die as a result. Whilst people are never going to agree completely on that, I think we're all agreed that the Kurdish people have had an abominable record of their treatment by successive governments in Iraq, and one hopes the Kurdish autonomous region will be recognised universally, and that will be a place where Kurdish people can lead. When we talk of genocides and  all -- obviously the recognition of the Holocaust against Jewish people in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s is paramount in every one's Fox. Indeed, attending a Holocaust memorial day is a very important thing, and young people understanding of what the Holocaust was a boat is very important. It is also important for them to understand that there have been other genocides around the world, and there is not time to go through all the more defined in all, but it is an important thing to understand. The European treatment of native Americans in the colonisation of North America in the 16th century  particularly later on, was to all intents and purposes a genocide against those people. Then one looks at others such as  wrote one de, which was abominable and appalling, and perhaps closer to the area we are talking about now, and this is one that does excite an awful lot of  but recognising the Armenian massacre of 1915 and associating that with the same principles of what happened to the Kurdish people, one finds a bit -- great deal of criticism from people who frankly ought to know better in Turkey that we have no right to that history has been important.

When we celebrate in Finsbury Park in a month's time, that will be a joy it is celebration. If we recognise  that is a big step. It is recognising something defined in law as the attempt to obliterate a people because of their identity,  their ethnicity. In  we recognise something awful that has happened.

And everyone who has spoken in this debate should be very proud of the conurbation that they have made. Can I start by saying to my very good friend from Blaydon that I have listened to this debate very closely. I will consider extremely carefully everything that has been said today. I am conscious that I am the first speaker in this debate who has not visited  I should apologise for  and I hope that this is something that will be remedied very  because what I have become  in the role I have on the  is the great warmth that exists between the people of Kurdistan and the people of the United Kingdom.

The words that we have struggled to find today to describe how dreadful the events in Kurdistan were over that period cannot reflect the acts that did  We then heard from the honourable member for Harlow, who speaks with great passion on these  and brought his personal experience to bear upon the facts, and his Jewish background adds a particular aspect to this debate on and that is hugely relevant to what we are discussing today. I was very conscious when I attended an excellent Holocaust Memorial Day service across the road that the constant emphasis on the Jewish community pays that the Holocaust is not about -- not just about the Jewish community. A Rwandan survivor explained the effect of the Rwandan genocide upon her, and she spoke as eloquently as Holocaust survivors did on that day. So it is very important to see this as part of a broader picture. We then heard from the honourable member who has an extremely long impressive record and consistent record on human right  particularly in connection  I got to know her after I came to the House in 2003. She referred to the campaign, and not many people were involved in the campaign at that time, which became more relevant after 2003. She was  determined and absolutely committed to the cause of bringing people to justice. She pursued that from the time that I met her in  and she is pursuing it today. She is a very busy woman, so she's not here at the moment. But she is someone with a very long and proud  , of course, had the consistency on this issue right through from the 1980s, and in fact  She deserves great credit, and I am proud to record her as a friend and someone who has taught me a huge amount about this issue. We then heard from the honourable member for  who has an advantage over me in that he has visited Kurdistan, and a compelling case that he has  We are considering these  and it is hugely important for us as parliamentarians, and it is great credit to all of the members who are here today that we are discussing this important issue. Then we heard from the honourable member for Blaydon, who I understand gnosis issue like no one else does. I remember a discussion we had outside the chamber on this issue, and he described the complicated situation he has on the issue of  and the contradiction he sees in his views on the Iraq war in  and the contacts he has had subsequently. It is not a straightforward issue. This is a difficult issue and odd job is about difficult issues. The debate we are having today is on a difficult  And as the honourable member for Islington North said, another man who has a proud record in campaigning on these issues, it is a big step for this House and any government to say that any set of incidents and events be considered a  We know by some other  that we have referred  and we know that those steps have not been taken by particular governments of those  Because the issue of whether a set of incidents can be described as a genocide is something that has a legal status.

I am sure the honourable gentleman with will agree with me, I am thinking of the definitions have worried me, because I used to think like that, when I was in Bosnia 92, 93.The honourable gentleman speaks with a passion and eloquence from, again from his own experience, and we all respect that experience, and of  recognise the humanity of what he says.

Am grateful to my honourable friend for giving way, I tonnes issues is  and the legallish issues and I a am sure the minister will dom that at the moment. We have a situation where Governments often now look to give aapologies thing which happen many many years ago, and I have concerns that those aren't really necessarily terribly  because it was somebody else who did that. Here, we are in a situation where a Government could recognise general siefpltd it is not something this Government or any Government has done but make on the back of this debate now is the time for opposition tart pis, and Government parties -- party, to come together and say shouldn't we look at whether this Government and Governments in the future should have a process to recognise  because it is important. It is certainly important, and I think what is important is that these matters are dealt with collectively, because we are an international community and we have international institutions. And I think that when we have an international situation, such as the one we are discussing today, the appropriate approach is to work through international justice  to recognise when particular circumstances amount to such as a genocide, and if they did amount to such a genocide, then we need to use the institutions which  in order to establish when those facts exist, and the implications of those facts in law.  the legal implications of recognising any set of events, as a genocide, not just the events we are considering today, are very considerable. It creates a particular crime, under international law, and that imposes obligations on states to prevent and to punish in connection with those particular sets of circumstances. So, when an stans has happened in the past, -- instance has happened in the past, as we are discussing today, if they are defined as genocide, the issue arises whether in fact as a retrospective element to that, and whether the current application of a description to a set of events is  then enables action to be taken retrospectively in respect of those acts,, so I think that one of the issues that we need to consider is the retrospectivety of of the issue, and I think it would be helpful if the minister could, could clarify whether it is his thaung a statement would would create a retrospective effect, and present actions could be taken against anyone held responsible, in connection with previous actions that took place back in the '80s. Stw We have heard today, of the progress that the Kurdistan has  The very considerable progress it has made, which is building on the relationship that exists between this country and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. And I think that the debate today, will,  add to that., that relationship. There is a very strong group of members of this  who have spokenel quantityly today who --el quantity le today, who have great respect for Kurdistan and great respect for the Kurdish people.

And seeing what actions are being taken by other countries, whether they be Parliaments or whether they be Governments and what is the appropriate forum for the taking forward of consideration of this  I thank him for giving way, in line with what the member for Sheffield said, will he today commit our party to enter inin discussion with the Kurdistan regional Government about whether they can help to us get evidence that may help to develop a legal argument that the international community can say yes, it is, or if it isn't these are the reasons why. I will will be please to discuss the issues we have been discussing today and see what barriers are in the way of this matter being taken  I would also be pleased to speak to the honourable gentleman that the minister to discuss this matter further, to see whether we can explore further common ground on an issue that is, that is considered by a number of backbenchers from both the parties that we represent, it is very  and who have today made a very eloquent and compelling case on the issue.

The honourable member for Blaydon confronted honestly the problems occasionally thrown up by the twin difficulties of foreign policy in hindsight. And confronted the issues there. I think he is right to express the fact that sometimes we don't know everything and we make decision as best we can at the time. I am not sure if looking back, the honourable gentleman made the point about should we have done more  I do remember the time of the 1991 gulf wa, and that the arguments then, should the forces have pressed on the Baghdad?

I am aware of my honourable friend's commendable support for the victims of Saddam's terrible campaign against the Kurds and for his call for his crimes to be recognised as genocide. I have heard today that this is a view shared by many other Honourable Members and many more who could not be present today, and many -- and many members of the public who signed the petition. My honourable friend and other members will be aware of the Government's position on the principle of genocide  Indeed, he stated it. I am great be sympathetic to the motion of this debate. The Government does not in any way oppose it and I have no doubt that parliaments will respond to the views expressed by my Honourable Friends and the terms of the motion.

More recently, our Consul General Bill discussed the campaign that the Minister for Martyrs in  He will represent the UK at future ceremonies and express the UK in remembrance of these tragic events.

I share all the honourable members views that Iraq's Kurds suffered a prolonged injustice under the previous regime.

The question is as on the order  Adds many of that opinion  The contrary no. The ayes  The ayes have it. I beg to move this House now adjourn. The question is this House now adjourn.  I am grateful for this opportunity to address the House and to explain to the House and to the minister, the disaster that is playing out in slow motion, in the NHS in South West London. I am talking of course about a programme named the better services better value programme, which was launched by the south-west London Primary Care Trust cluster, two years ago. BSVB was set up to address concerns about quality and patient safety. The argument is that London should lead the way to all consultant rotas to guarantee better care. Taken at face value, no-one could argue with that proposition, we all want great care, we all want the safest and best care for our  families, constituents. But BS BV's answer is a grandiose reconfiguration of acute care, costing over £350 million. Now they propose the centralisation of emergency care, maternity and paediatric care on fewer hospital sites in south-west London. The  is the loss of two A&amp;E  two maternity units and three paediatric units and other associated service. Now, despite the quality and safety concerns being the driving force, they have discounted actual quality today, and assume quality improve but with no explanation or evidence to justify this assumption, that those that are not good now will necessarily become better in the future and they have certainly not spelled out how that will be made  Now I have to tell the minister that, BS BV is causing damage to the NHS in south-west  It is dividing medical opinion and demoralising staff in  such as my own St Helier, it is distracting the NHS, from the much bigger task, of delivering the productivity and quality gains needed to meet the Nicholson challenge n the wake of the Francis  it is clear that BSBV has mot considered the impact of forced reconfiguration on patient safety. That must be a risk that should be properly evaluated and taken into consideration. Now, I said that BSBV had come up with a grandiose  At the top of every list it draws up comes my local hospital,  my constituents are being pectsed to travel for longer and further because of a dogma, the greatest specialisation on fewer hospital sites improves outcomes. Last year paper in the Health Service management research journal examined the evidence to support  Antony Harrison of the King's Fund reviewed a large number  some commissioned for the  and concluded that there is no evidence of a a causal link between volume and outcock  BSBV relies on this dogma. It tries to shame anyone who argues  by painting opponents as being op posed or being indeed in a position where they are prepared to support and tolerate poorer outcomes. Now, this is something they are advancing without evidence. Indeed there is some evidence that greater specialisation may save live, but the very organise nation of hyper acute care and major trauma being kasds in point those are examples where it makes a difference and they have made a difference in  I do think it is important we await the results of studys of how those improvements have been secured before we really have a full of all the factors that have played a part in delivering the game gains they have realised. While it advanced their view of the benefits of sently say, I think they fail to examine some of the  They ignore evidence demonstrating a link between mortality and miles travelled. As enough as 1% increase in mortality for every extra mile travelled. They ignore evidence that shows St Helier has one of the safest maternity units in London, where mums wanted to have their baby, they fail to consider the benefits of retaining A&amp;E, maternity and paediatric services to ensure the NHS has the capacity to meet rising demand and demand is rising, birth rates are rising and the number of people needing hospital service, in pursuit of this dogma that manufacture ashupbls about the extent to which demand can be shifted out of hospitals, or avoided all together. So they assume 10% of A&amp;E attendances can be avoided up to 60% of admissions can be shifted to urgent care. But the evidence for this is weak and it is contested by emergency care  There is in fact a growing body of evidence that calls into question some of the divergent schemes set in place, even the national clinical advisory team, in their evaluation of BSBV last summer questioned the assumptions and cautioned the BSBV programme. They said this, experience elsewhere has shown on imply tation not all the the plan shifts if flow  And they suggest that a more realistic figure of round 30% of A&amp;E patients shifting to urgent care are more damning still in that independent assessment, they warn that the data used to make these assumptions is recognised in emergency care, as lacking  The flawed ashupbls are at the heart of the grant  I think they pose a Nor had they worked out how much it might cost to deliver the changes in primary and community health  Some reports comment on this  One report said, at present attention is focused on hospital reconfiguration. There should be at least as much concern jaunt to the developments in primary and community care, which are essential prerequisites of that hospital reorganisation. Despite the fact that some Hellier's maternity unit is performing above the average and 30041000 mums are choosing to have their babies there  despite the fact that the welfare and health inequality concerns of giving birth in more remote locations, they are proposing to break up of an excellent maternity and paediatric  The evidence causes this into  I said it was distracting from the big challenge facing the  the Nicolson £20 billion  That was identified back in 2008 at the Department of Health. Up to 2016 the NHS and south-west London has drawn up plans to find £394 million of quality and productivity improvements out of a 4 billion. The money they free up is to be put to work by using it to meet rising demand and improvements in quality. It will be a tough programme to deliver and no one disputes that. I have to tell the Minister that this is not helping. B S B B contributes very little to Dave Mickelson  In fact, it just delivers £18 million. Is all the pain worth it? They want to spend a projected £350 million in capital. According to their figures, it would take over 20 years to get a payback on this capital investment, yet its purpose is to tackle quality and safety concerns which we all want tackled to fix consultant wrote to us and other  On their own figures, addressing those concerns will cost between £4 million and £7 million. Surely there is a do least harm option that has been drawn up to find ways of delivering the benefits without all the costs of this grand design. No such plan has been drawn up. They have not produced a do minimum option. To date they have spent £5.5 million and this year they plan to spend an additional £6 million and an additional £2 million every year. There is a saving surely to be made  We have the grand design in search of the justification. A classic top-down reconfiguration. The goal has been to reach decisions before the old NHS structures are abolished at the end  tying the hands of the new GP led clinical commissioning  During the passage of the Health and Social Care Act last year we were clear that there should be new ways for health care to be designed in the future, but then so be different. And it will be based on a detailed analysis of the current and future needs of the local population. The last time such an analysis was done in my area in 2009, it didn't provide support for a wholesale change in  So, B S the fee is trying to drive a horse and coaches through this. Because it has deterred -- it has so clearly determined the fate of some Hellier, it has cost of planning blight. It has cost you John certainty. It has jeopardised the 219 million. We pulled off some Hellier hospital. That blight could be lifted today if the Minister made it clear that it is the part of the Government's designed to allow the old institutions of the NHS, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities on how the new clinical groups can act. You can't say .. that she rejects any re creation of the top-down culture and will insure that seemed -- that chemical groups meet the needs of their populations. I don't underestimates -- underestimates the difficulty of this. What is clear is that this does not offer a credible mechanism for resolving those challenges. As the principal commissioners of services at different trusts, they chemical group should be able to the commission health care for the  It should be unfettered by any legacies from the outgoing help commissioners. I hope as the new commissioners come on board, they can bring this to an end. A clear break with this flawed process will be a clear signal that there will be a fresh start, that they want to engage with the trust and local community to map out a future for acute health care services that has clinical and community support. In  I hope the Minister might be able to confirm that the local commissioning groups are free to bring the programme to an end. That they too minimum option is a must be when it comes to reconfiguration it. And that the Department of Health will take a critical and close look at this old-style top-down reconfiguration. B S Bedi is based on flawed  It is time to waste -- to stop wasting money on this and we need a fresh start in south-west  not a tired, worn-out, NHS reconfiguration of the worst sort. Today begin by paying a tribute to my right honourable friend primarily for his long service and great work that he did in the Department of Health as a minister and for securing this debate. To also absolutely say that he has made a number of very good points. I don't so agree with everything he  but he has made some good and important points and I can assure him that my officials most certainly will read his speech and that there is anything that isn't covered in my remarks in response to his speech then we will write to  I strongly suspect I would be able to give them the kind of fantasy will like. As ever, he stands up as he is right and proper  stands up for his  At the end of the day, we all want the very best services for those people who are good enough to return us to displace, or even if they don't vote for us, Deputy Speaker, they are entitled to the best services. As the honourable friend will know, it is not my job or mime role to defence or rubbish that better services better-value process. I have no doubt that it was set up for all the very best of reasons. There are no proposals as you will appreciate at this stage, but there is this huge consultation stage and I am told that the underlying reason why this better services better-value scheme was set up was an order to ensure that the people through the whole of the south-west of London and the Sutton... Surrey Downs,  had that very best health services available seven days a week and 24 hours a day. It is right that a number of honourable members to represent the area that has covered by this review have made various representations. Some have spoken in this place, others have been to see me. My right honourable friend from Wimbledon is coming to see me next week. My right honourable friend from Croydon Central, ants from much in and Morton have spoken on the most recent debate on the future of accident and emergency. I will refer to some of those speeches in  I should just say that the area of this Configuration covers south-west London and the Surrey Downs. It has a population 4 million people. Surrey Downs 000 people. Between them they enjoy a health-service that is funded to the tune of £2.8 billion  I also make it clear that much of this is about saving money, meeting their Nicholson challenge. It continues because we recognise that these are savings that must be carried through. This is not about  If anybody makes that case, then they're not doing this debate any service because this is not about brutal cuts, it is about trying to deliver the very best service for people throughout the whole of the area. I just wanted to say the following, if I may. I thought my right honourable friend the Prime Minister during the course of the front as reports, his presentation to displace and the questions they were asked of him, I thought he gave an answer which we should all remember. I want to repeat its. He said, on 6th February this year, Ledley repair again to one of the things that may need to change in our political debate if we really are going to put patient care upfront, we must sometimes look at the facts concerning the level of service in some hospitals and some care homes, and not always as we have all done,  reach for the button that says a posed the local change. I agree very much at those words of the Prime Minister. I think it is beholden for all of us, no matter what Park replay, when looking at how be reconfigured, reorganise health services, and I'm not saying that my Right Honourable Friends has done this, but others do, is to take their immediate reaction to oppose change. Change is the right  It is the right driver to make sure that the people of this country get the very best services. By way of explaining perhaps how difficult it is to make reconfiguration I refer to the speech of the honourable member from it Jim on the recent debate on accident and emergency. She said my local NHS as it needs to reconfigure services because it has to deliver £370 million saving each  That this reduction of 24 %. A programme has been set up laugh of it -- lacking the colt better services better value to decide which of the local hospitals should lose its A&amp;E department. That is despite the fact that across south- west London the number of people going to a Me is going up by 20 % and the birthrate in our part of London continues to rise. There is another honourable member of this place who will join with my friend in opposing any changes, closures and cuts at St Hellier. The Minister is responding very fully to point I made so far. I want to make a point which demonstrates a distinction between the honourable lady -- the honourable lady Mates  She has conflated the better services better value programme with the it Nicholson  It is being taken forward completely separately. It does not deliver on the Mickelson  -- Nicholson challenge. Tour group the right honourable  I thought that the analysis of the honourable member for Mitcham and Morden was not correct. She certainly, as my right honourable friend does, seeks to defend her hospital. She does not once any changes that in any way undermine her hospital and she makes that case with some passion. I thought then it was interesting that my honourable friend, the Member for Croydon Central, he also took part in do It debates, he made his speech in complete contradiction to what she had said.
