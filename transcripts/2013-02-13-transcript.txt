I welcome that very much. Given the amount of investment going into the pupil premium, and how important it should be in school improvement and outcomes improvement for a particular group of young children, do you think it would be important to do some sort of longitudal study of the effects of the pupil premium?We will continue to do  The Minister has asked me, David Laws has asked me to continue to produce inspection reports on how well it's being used and we will continue to do that. That is where we will have to leave our live coverage from the committee rooms to go over to our live Welcome to BBC Parliament's live coverage from the House of Commons.  David Cameron will face Labour Leader Ed Miliband and backbenchers for Prime Minister's  Labour's Harriet Harman has tabled an urgent question on the Leveson proposals for press regulation which should start at 30pm. MP also be asked to approve the Police Grant Report which sets out money given to local forces in England and Wales. The Local Government Finance Report will also be considered. After that, the Chamber will move on to motions tabled by Iain Duncan Smith to bring into force the annual increase in the state pension and social security benefits. Remember to join me for a round-up of the day in both Houses of Parliament at 00pm tonight. First, we have questions to Michael Moore and his THE SPEAKER: Order. Order. Questions to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Alun Cairns. There is currently just over two gigawatts of installed and operational capacity in Scotland. I'm grateful to the Secretary of State for his response. Is he aware that Anglesey is about to benefit from a massive investment in a new nuclear power statement? Can I say to my honourable friend that there is a significant contribution to our current energy mix from nuclear. He will be aware that planning is devolved on these matters to  It is a matter for the Scottish Parliament to determine. I'm delighted that we are seeing an increase in the proportion of renewables in our energy mix as part of a sustainable, affordable energy supply in the UK. ETF Group's nuclear power stations produced the highest output for seven years in 2012. Does the Secretary of State agree with me that there is a continuing long- term role for nuclear in keeping the lights on in Scotland? I don't think anybody can ignore the significant contribution that nuclear makes and I have my constituents who are employed there. I think that is important, that  that they play in our  I want to see a sustainable mix across the energy supplies and I think with renewables and others in the mix, that is a good thing.Why is it this Government is determined to throw money at an industry that has never been economically viable for refusing to set a decarbonisation target to boost renewables industry which is creating thousands of new jobs in Scotland?Well, through energy market reform we are underpinning the renewables sector for a very long time to come. I have to say what I don't understand is how the Scottish and National Party can propose independence where Scottish renewables would end up losing the biggest source of consumers to underpin the economics of that very important sector. Question two, Mr Speaker. Mr  in its impact assessment published on 28th June, 2012, the Department for Work and Pensions estimates 80,000 claimants of housing benefit in the social rented sector will be affected by the underoccupation measure. The Minister knows as well as I do that thousands of people in low income households in Scotland will lose out because of the bedroom tax and they have no realistic prospect of moving to a smaller house. Claimants in Scotland will be hit because of the mismatch between the available housing stock and the needs of tenants. Will he take this opportunity to distance himself by the shameful attempt of this Government to stigmatise and penalise people who live in council houses and need help with their rent?What is shameful is the way the Scottish National Party play party politics with vulnerable people pretending that there can be no welfare changes yet putting forward nothing in their place and not indicating how welfare would be paid for in an independent Scotland. The bedroom tax and other changes to housing benefits means millions of pound also be removed from the Scottish economy and hundreds of jobs lost across the country according to the institute. Can the Secretary of State tell the House what discussions he has had with the Chancellor about how to mitigate these losses to the Scottish economy? Mr Speaker, what the honourable member and his colleagues fail to ever mention is the Discretionary Housing Payment fund which will come in place to support people in difficult  He and his colleagues should be urging councils in Scotland to make use of that money. Scotland will get a good share of the �155 million being provided. Does the Minister not recognise in fact that there are people crying as a result of being given notices right now that tell them that they are in a position where they will have to get out their house or lose housing benefit as a result come 1st April? That is the reality. Can the Minister not waken up to that fact? Mr Speaker, I'm surprised that the honourable member and others are not working with their local councils and housing associations to draw attention to the availability of the discretionary payment fund and the fact there will be opportunity to support the most vulnerable. As well as the bedroom tax, this Government is preparing to further tighten the worst squeeze in decades on ordinary people's living standards by cutting most benefits and tax credits by 4% in real terms over the next three years in plans that hurt the poorest 40% in Scotland three-and-a-half times harder than the wealthiest. Does the Minister not accept that with 000 working age couples and single people in Scotland losing up to �5 a week, these cuts are not just socially brutal but disastrous for the Scottish economy, too? Mr  what I accept is that the party opposite put this country into the financial circumstances that we founded at the 2010  The party opposite said they wanted to reform welfare. They are quite happy to criticise individual measures but they come up with no proposals at all to fund those measures or to put forward any alternative proposals. Number Thank you. I welcome the recent announcement by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport on the planned extension of HS2 to Manchester and  Journey times between Scotland and London will be reduced as a result. Does the Minister agree that there is a strange irony in the fact that HS2 will bring our two nations closer together and yet the Scottish Government is intent on driving a wedge between them? I think the honourable lady is quite right to point out the irony. Most policies pursued by the Scottish National Party are about breaking  On this issue, they appear to want to bring Britain closer together. The Minister's answer will not do. If he was serious about improving transport  HS2, which is a massive  wouldn't start in londond and -- London and grind to a halt in Manchester and Leeds. Can I ask the Minister to go one better than the Department of Transport and tell us if this Government have a timescale for the development of a plan for the completion of HS2 to Scotland?What this Government is  Mr Speaker, is engaging with the Scottish Government in a  At this moment, we are waiting to hear from them. Does my honourable friend recognise the importance to transport links of dualling the A1? Will he continue to press the case with Scottish Ministers and colleagues in the UK Government? I welcome the announcement by the Chancellor that the A1 would become a motorway to Newcastle and I think in a response to the very same right honourable  the Chancellor made it very clear that the Department of Transport would look at the case of dualling the A1 to the Scottish  Can I say to the Minister as Chair of the all-party West Coast Main Line Group I did write to a Scottish Government Minister in respect of HS2 asking what were they prepared to do in terms of investment in that route starting from the North? Is it not irresponsible that the Scottish Government will not answer this question of HS2 but two city councils will discuss it? I'm very disappointed that the honourable  particularly in his capacity as Chair of the West Coast Main Line Group hasn't had a response from the Scottish  The UK Government are waiting for a response from the Scottish Government. We want to work with them to ensure the people of Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom benefit from HS2. Can I agree with earlier questioners and with the Minister  if it is to go ahead, is important both to the North of England and to those transport links between Scotland and England? Can I have his assurance that he and his right honourable friend, the Secretary of State, will argue for this in Cabinet and encourage the Government to start HS2 in the North? I appreciate the right honourable lady's question. As  she has taken a very keen interest in Scotland. But she knows, as well as I do, the Government's position and that is that HS2 will I don't accept that Scots are in the dark in relation to aIt to  The UK government has made it clear that is its aspiration - to achieve a high- speed rail in Scotland. We want to work closely with the Scottish government and we look forward to them coming forward with proposals. With permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions for and five  I'm in contact with the Scottish business community in the run-up to next year's budget, and come up with a range of measures to promote growth and fairness. The Secretary of State is well respected in this House, but as a  surely he can see the unfairness of a massive tax cut in April while introducing a bad run  The draconian bedroom tax will do damage to the vulnerable, disabled and housing associations.

May I say politely to the honourable lady that, like many of their colleagues, she forgets the terrible financial backdrop against which we have had to make difficult  We are looking for sustainable welfare, and to continue to emphasise and develop the fairness agenda, which we have done through cuts in tax and introducing changed universal credit to get a stronger welfare  Having the lowest corporation tax in all at the G7 countries makes Scotland an attractive investment prospect. That would be endangered if Scotland becomes independent. I absolutely agree with the honourable gentleman - it is essential we have a competitive business environment. The corporation tax proposals go to the heart of that. We want to strengthen the economy, take us away from the cliff we came to under the last government. I want to thank the Under-Secretary for organising the fuel summit in  It was revealed that the current discount could go up to 8p a litre while remaining within the Treasury budget of 5 million. Will it my right honourable friend will be a champion -- the Chancellor to insure government benefit is spent to the full benefit of the locals? The fuel discount is very important for remote communities. He has made a strong case about the Budget, which onshore the Chancellor will  -- which I am sure. Will he not tell the Chancellor this is one of the most rancid pieces of legislation that has been put through his since the poll tax? His party comes through with promises but no way of paying them, and nobody will listen to what he The Secretary of State was not prepared to confirm that 82% of Scottish members in this House voted against the bedroom tax. Just like the poll tax, an unpopular regressive measure is being imposed on the people of Scotland when the overwhelming majority of their representatives are opposed to it. Could he explain how any modern democracy allows these taxes to be imposed? I want a sustainable welfare system that protects the most honourable and supports people getting back to  The Universal Credit will help to ensure that, backed up by our fair tax delivery which means 000 tax -- Scots are now out of tax altogether.Thank you,  Could the Secretary of State make a representation on behalf of my constituent, Mrs Frances corner.

We are looking to support some of the most vulnerable in these circumstances during these changes, and I will be happy to discuss that with their. Perhaps in that discussion we could talk about with an -- there are thousands of others hit by this tax as well. Transitional funds do not help those people. I wonder if the Secretary of State ever imagined he would be signing of these policies with these Tories. Last year, he said he wanted to be judged by his  Is this what he had in mind? May I just remind my honourable friend of the scale of the financial challenge that faced this government when it came into office? And the need to tackle those serious problems?

The issues are being flushed out by this document on the legal status of Scotland in the UK, and of course over time, as these are discussed further, as appropriate, we will meet with the Scottish  I have said this on many occasions already.We all want a referendum campaign to be fair. Does the Secretary of State agree it is essential that all parties taking part in the referendum campaign must adhere to what the Electoral Commission has said about spending limits? My honourable friend is entirely right. Now we have cross-party agreement on accepting the recommendations of the electorate commission, can the Secretary of State say at what information he will put into the public domain are on the implication of separation from the UK for things like pensions, the welfare system and the economy of  which people need to know before they cast their vote? The honourable lady is entirely right for us to focus on issues of substance to families across  Yesterday in the Privy Council and order was approved and now we have an illegal, fair and decisive referendum process. But we need to discuss the big issues. There are some big questions here they need to be debated, and so far, no answers from the SNP. Does my right honourable friend accept that if the outcome of the referendum campaign is to engage the confidence of the Scottish people, the campaign must be conducted with candour and transparency? This week, the Government published its view of the legal consequences of independence. Isn't it time that those who argue for independence did exactly the same? It has been a curious week but my honourable friend is right to highlight that  the SNP hasn't been clear whether to embrace the opinions of our legal experts or lamb ask them. The merit of this document is we have now laid out the key arguments. -- lambast them.

Scotland's proud history of  innovation and discovery is inextricably bound up with this United Kingdom. Does the Minister agree that the only short certain and best way to ensure Scotland remains at a leader in world class research is for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom? I absolutely agree with that point. He will be aware that Scottish universities and research institutes get �436 million from UK research councils - roughly 13% of the overall funding of scientific research.There are a lot of very noisy private conversations taking place in the  Let's have a bit of order.

On the issue of  There is a point of having some courtesy to the member asking the question. -- order!The fixed gambling terminals had sucked up millions of Pounds of profits in the betting shops in Scotland. They are called the crack cocaine of the gambling industry. Is it not time that the Secretary of State lobbied to have the gambling prevalence Survey reinstated so we know how much addicted gambling is in Scotland and in other parts of the UK? I don't agree with the gentleman on the reintroduction of the prevalence survey, but I commend the Daily Record and the honourable member for hireling -- for highlighting issues with problem gambling. He may be aware the Government is currently conducting a consultation on the links between problem gambling and these machines. Number nine.

I'm afraid the honourable lady's assumption is  At meetings I have had with COSLA and the Scottish Federation of Houdsing Associations and my -- Housing Associations, we have discussed this issue and satisfied the concerns. THE SPEAKER: Order, questions to the Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker. Thank you. This morning, I had meetings with colleagues and in addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today. My constituent Constable Phillippa Wrens is being buried this  I'm sure the whole House will express sympathy to her family. The horsemeat scandal has not only seriously undermined confidence in the safety of the food we eat, but threatens a very successful meat  Can the Prime Minister assure me that this Government will relentlessly follow every lead until each individual person or business responsible for any criminal or fraudulent act has been  exposed, prosecuted and then expelled from ever again having any part in the UK food industry? I fully support what the honourable gentleman has said. Let me join him in praising Constable  She died going about her  keeping people safe in the community that she loved. I would send my deepest condolences and those of everyone in this House to Constable's Reynolds colleagues and her loved ones. On this issue where people are buying beef products are finding out that it could be  Let me say this.

Would the Prime Minister please join in celebrating a culture that touches both sides of the English-Scottish border by celebrating Cumbria Day with us today? I'm very much looking forward to joining my honourable friend at the celebration of Cumbria Day here in the House of Commons. He is incredibly fortunate to represent one of the most beautiful and brilliant constituencies in the House of Commons. I remember particularly the time we spent at the Butcher's Arms, an outstanding pub in a very beautiful part of our world. THE SPEAKER: Mr Ed Miliband. Mr  can the Prime Minister tell us whether at the end of this Parliament living standards will be higher or lower than they were at the beginning? What we are doing is helping working people by taking 24ml people and giving them a tax cut this year and living standards will be higher for those people on the minimum wage, working full-time, whose income tax bill has already been halved under this Government.  it was ever such a simple question. I want a simple  In 2015, people will be asking am I better off now than I was five years ago? What is his answer?The answer is people will be a lot better off than they were under Labour with a record deficit, with unreformed welfare, with a busted banking system, they will have seen a Government that's got the deficit down, that's cut their  that's dealt with the banks and as the Governor of the Bank of England said today is on the road to recovery. All he shows is how out of touch he is. And he's out of touch with his own office of budget responsibility figures. What they show is that by 2015 people will be worse off than they were in 2010 because prices have been rising faster than earnings under  Why is this happening? It's because he told us the economy would be growing. He told us the economy would be growing, but the truth is it has been flatlining. Will he acknowledge that it is his failure to get growth which means that we are having a falling not rising living standards in this country? First of all, prices are rising - I would remind him inflation is lower under this Government than what we inherited from Labour. It has been cut in half from its peak. Of course, if his question is have you had to take difficult decisions to deal with the deficit, to get on top of the problems that we face, to reform welfare, to clean up our banks? You bet we have had to take difficult decisions! No-one in this country is in any doubt about why we have had to take difficult  It is because of the mess that he left. First of all, the deficit is going up, not down under him because of his economic  Secondly, we have a flatlining economy and this will be the question of the next two years - declining living standards as a  Of course, amidst that, there is one group for whom the good times will come this April.

And then, Mr Speaker, he declared without a hint of irony the Tories are no longer the party of privilege! Mr Speaker, you couldn't make it up. Let me put the question another way. We are talking about people earning 000 a week. Let me ask him the question again. What is it about them that made him think this April they needed extra help to keep the wolf from the door? It is this Government that's helped working people by freezing the council tax, cutting the petrol duty, cutting tax for 24 million people and legislating so they get the lowest tariff on their Energy Bill. That is what we have done. The top rate of tax is higher than any year he was in the Treasury. He talks about important political speeches. Could he confirm this? I have an  He is going to make a major speech tomorrow and I have the invitation. This is the invitation that's been sent out. Ed Miliband is going to make a major speech on the economy on Thursday. It won't have any new policies in it! THE SPEAKER: Ed Miliband. Mr  let me tell him, let me  he would be most welcome to attend the speech and he might learn something! Every week that  the evidence mounts against him on the economy. There is a living standards crisis for the many and all he does is stand up for a few at the top. We've got a failing Prime Minister. He's out  He stands up for the wrong people. Once again, we have heard nothing to say about the  nothing to say about  nothing to say about growth and now he is going to make a speech tomorrow which he kindly invites me to but I have to say if there aren't any policies, what would be the point in coming? Let me refer him to his policy guru, the honourable member for Dagenham. He is responsible for Labour's  He says this, "Simply opposing the cuts without an alternative is no good." That is  The whole frontbench opposite is no good.  Mr Speaker. The welfare state and the NHS are there to support our constituents when they fall on difficult times. Will the Prime Minister assure the House that he will not allow them to be abused by illegal immigrants and nationals who are coming here as benefit tourists? I think my honourable friend makes a very important point. Britain has always been an open and welcoming economy, but it isn't right if our systems are being abused. That is why I chaired yesterday a committee meeting in Whitehall which my right honourable friend, the Minister for  is leading where we are going to look at every single one of our systems - housing,  benefits - to make sure we are not a soft touch for those who want to come here. I think it is vital that we get this right. There are many parts of our current arrangements which simply don't pass a simple commonsense test in terms of access to housing, access to the Health Service, access to justice which should be the right of all British citizens but are not the right of anyone who chooses to  If the Prime Minister is really serious about tackling the serious problem of misleading labelling and the contamination of  what possible future is there for the future of this coalition with the Lib Dems?The coalition must be clearly labelled at all points. He does reference an important point. Retailers I think do bear a real responsibility here. At the end of the day, it is they who are putting products on their shelves and have got to say that they are career about where that meat came from, what it was, who it was supplied by. It is up to them to test that. That is vitally  With our plans to cap Social Care Bills, we are starting to defuse that ticking time bomb. I think the honourable lady makes an important point. I would have thought every Member of Parliament has heard this from their own constituents at meetings with groups like Age Concern, that right now it is unfair that the fickled finger of fate can pick you out for dementia or Alzheimer's and you lose the house that you have invested your lifetime savings in. It isn't fair and for the first  this Government has come up with the money to make sure that we put a cap on what any family has to  It is the biggest pro- inheritance move that any Government has made in 20 years. Let's be clear. The intention is not that people should have to 000, but because we put a cap in place, there should be a proper insurance market. I don't want anyone to have to pay anything. That is what these reforms can help The Prime Minister is  Does he share my concerns that many of his answers may contain 100% bull if tested?That is is a very good line! I do think this is a serious issue. I hope that - I hope people - people are genuinely worried about what they  I think we have to get a grip of this rather than make jokes about it. I will think of another one by the end of the Does the Prime Minister take a dim view of those who say one thing and mean another? Order! We must hear Dot dot while undermining the community as the Football Association have done this week? First of all, I wish her well in her campaign to help Portsmouth Football Club. On the issue of the Eastleigh election, what I would say to people there is, if you want a straight-talking candidate that does what it says on the 10, Maria Hutchins is a fantastic campaign and she would make a great MP.They ask the Prime Minister of Fun is help? -- may I ask the Prime Minister for his help? One of my constituents has heart disease and lung disease. The NHS will not respond to my correspondence as to whether they will agree to allowing a world famous cardiologist to offer a specific treatment. I cannot get a response and my constituent may die if he does not get this treatment. If she gives me the details I will see what I can do to get a better answer from the health authority. Each year, and dozens -- dozens of constituents have to have sell a house to receive adequate care. Will the recent proposals at last begin to address this issue? As he said, it is completely random who suffers from dementia, and then they suddenly find they could be spending up to 10 years and a care  and it completely wipes out all their savings. To cap the costs for the first time is a major break  I think it is a progressive move that will help hard-working families that want to save and pass on their house to their children. Since the coalition came to power, some 350 libraries have closed. The Communities Secretary has dismissed those campaigning to save local libraries, those parents hoping to teach their children to read, those who want to study our history and literature, as just a bunch of luvvies. Whatever happened to the big society? I strongly support our libraries and in my own constituency we are working hard to make sure libraries will be staying  I think part of the answer to help keep libraries open is to tap the enthusiasm of communities to volunteer in libraries to keep them  I'm sure that, like mean, he will welcome the report that volunteering and charitable giving  -- like me. On Saturday, I spoke at an event organised by Christian Aid and hosted to talk about tax avoidance in developing  Will the Prime Minister agree we can do much to combat this problem by assisting countries turn up develop their own tax collection capabilities, and to announce -- turn require companies to be transparent about taxes paid for each operation? My honourable friend makes a good point, there is a huge amount we can do here. We need to do far more in all these  because it is a vital part of development. The issue he raised he says -- he raises with regard to tax transparency is  and we have put it at the top of the agenda for the G8 meeting that will take place in June in Northern Ireland. It brings together developed and developing countries with a shared agenda.The Prime Minister gave the House an update on the EU negotiations on  He will know that regional aid which comes from the EU plays an important role for the regional assemblies when it comes to attracting inward investment. Can you give an update on the continuation of regional aid? The outcome of the Budget leaves the amount of overall regional aid that Britain will be receiving broadly similar to the last period, at around 11 billion euros. There are changes in the definitions of  partly because there is a new concept of a transition region that has come in.

Is the Prime Minister and news that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister are trying to claim credit for his brilliant move to achieve a real tax cut in the Budget? Does he hope they will now follow his need -- his lead and call for a referendum to be put to the British people? I hope that first of all they will come -- and thence their MEPs to vote for the budget reduction. That would be helpful. -- will convince. The Shadow Chancellor was asked, would you support a referendum? His  that depends how stupid  He went on to say, we have absolutely not ruled out a  which is in contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, he said they did not want one. According to a Freedom of Information and so, there were 000 fewer uniformed police officers on the streets after the Prime Minister's first two years in  Why has the Prime Minister of broken his promise to protect frontline policing? First of all, crime is down by 10%, not just  but specifically in the honourable member's area. That is a much greater reduction and for the whole of the Metropolitan Police  The number of neighbourhood police officers is actually up. There are many few offices in back  In 2010, there were 300 - that is now under 1,000. So  there has been a reform agenda for the police and there have been spending reductions, but crime is down and visible policing is up. With Japan and Switzerland all talking down their currencies despite the statement of the G7  does my right honourable friend agree that the most important aim of the G20 meeting in Moscow this coming weekend should be to establish means to prevent competitive devaluation, which, in  and I was alive then! Which in the 1930s, as I can remember from my father's  caused widespread  and the protectionism that goes with it?

I don't believe you do appreciate your way to growth, what ever country you are. What you should do is use the benefit when there is a structural change to make sure you increase your competitiveness. Can I say in relation to care for the elderly that the Prime Minister cannot have it both ways in terms of delivery and quality?

Can we not have a fair deal for the elderly, for Coventry and for the West Midlands? What I will say is at the start of this government, when we made the decision not to cut the NHS, we did put NHS money into adult social care in local government, because we recognised the importance of  I also argue that the move this week to Capote -- cap social care costs, of course that does not solve the whole problem, but if you can create a cap on what people are charged, you can create an insurance market so that everyone can protect themselves against the long-term costs of  That should see more money coming into this vital area. Will the Prime Minister welcome the figures from the Council of Mortgage lenders which shows the number of first-time buyers has hit a five-year high? I certainly will. This has been a problem that for the last few years. Nobody wants us to go back to the 110% mortgages we  but we do need to make available to young people the chance to buy a decent flat or house with a mortgage that does not require a massive deposits. That has not been possible recently, and I think the Bank of England move on the funding for lending scheme - �80 billion - is really feeding through to the market and making lower mortgages available. Further to the rather acerbic exchange between the Leader of the Opposition earlier, it can I ask the Prime Minister whether he will personally benefit from the next -- from the millionaire's tax cut to be introduced this April? I will pay all the taxes that are due in the proper way! The point I make To him is in all the years he sat on the side of the House, there was a top rate of tax that was lower than the one we are putting in place. I didn't hear any groaning from in then! -- from him then!Typical tax rates in my constituency are going up because a pet projects are being  Does the Prime Minister share my concern that hard-working families in Wales are being it used to find a Labour politics in Cardiff?This is a good point. This government has made available for a council tax freeze. The money is there in Wales for a council tax  and people in Wales know who to blame if their council tax is not frozen. It is the Labour Assembly Government in Wales. They are the one to blame. Last October, we remember the Prime Minister promised he would legislate to force energy companies to put customers on the lowest tariff. Can you explain why his energy bill contains no such commitment?The honourable member is wrong. It does exactly what it says. It legislates to give people the lowest tariff. Order!

A review into the procedures of the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospital Trust is being carried out because of the high mortality rate. This is of considerable concern to my constituents. Can the Prime Minister assure them that whatever recommendations come out of the review will be implemented in full? I can certainly give that assurance. It is important we get to the bottom of any hospital that has an unnaturally high mortality rate. It is important these inspections are properly carried out and that we all learn the lessons of the Mid Staffs Inquiry Report. THE SPEAKER: Order. Urgent question, Harriet Harman. I asked the Secretary of State for kl culture, media -- Culture, media and Sport to make a statement? Following the publication of Lord Justice Leveson's report, cross-party talks have been exploring different ways of implementing the tough self- regulatory system for the press that he recommended. And would ensure that justice for the victims of press abuse was done. As colleagues will know, there are already several press bills in the public domain which have been published by various organisations. The draft Royal Charter published by my party yesterday is outside of the normal arrangements for collective agreement and does not reflect an agreed position between the Conservative and Liberal  I made clear to this House on 3rd December that we would send a loud message to the press of this country that the status quo is not an option. Both the Prime Minister and I support a tough, new system of independence self- regulation as outlined by Lord Justice Leveson. We know that any new model must restore public confidence and ensure that the abuses of the past could not happen  We continue to have grave reservations around statutory underpinning and as such we have concerns about implementing a press  The Royal Charter that I have published will put in place Leveson's recommendations without the need for statutory underpinning. It would see the toughest press regulation this country has ever seen without compromising press  The Royal Charter implements the principles of Leveson in a practical fashion and is the Conservative Party's alternative to Lord Justice Leveson's suggested use of Ofcom as a verifying body. All parties now agree with us that handing further powers to Ofcom, an already powerful body, would not be  Let's be clear: The Charter does not create a regulator, rather it establishes a body that would oversee the regulator. A regulatory system that the Royal Charter body will oversee will be tough and the regulator will have the power that Leveson set out to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code, to impose up to �1 million fines to require corrections and other remedies including prominent  The Royal Charter body will ensure the new regulatory body is efficient and effective. We have also published draft clauses for exemplary damages which will provide very real incentives for the industry to join the regulator and ensure that there are serious consequences for those that don't. This is a tough regulation, a tough package and delivers the principles  Lord Justice Leveson's report was almost 2,000 pages long and there were areas raised within the report which all political parties have expressed very real concerns about. Ofcom is one  All political parties expressed serious reservations around the provisions around data protection and their potential to impact important investigative journalism. There were also concerns around whether it would be appropriate for the Information Commissioner to investigate and then decide on public interest. The Royal Charter reflects a Prince pled way forward proposed by the -- a Prince paled way forward and -- a Prince pled way forward proposed by this side of the House. We will continue to debate it as part of the cross-party talks and continue to seek to secure agreement. We are all committed to the Leveson  This is about taking the Leveson Report forward and making sure that it can work in  And the challenge before all of us is to find an agreement. I think the victims deserve nothing  I thank the honourable lady for that answer. Will she acknowledge that as they stand, the Conservative proposals do not implement the Leveson Report? We called for cross-party talks and in  we have been engaging in those talks with her and with the Minister for the Cabinet Office. Will she agree that what Leveson proposes is fair and is reasonable. It protects free speech and protects people from abuse and harassment by the press. There can be no justification for watering it  The most straightforward way of implementing Leveson is by statute rather than by Royal Charter and statute. Whatever the route that is chosen, it must be the full Leveson, not Leveson light. Leveson said that the system must be independent of Government. Yet through the Privy Council, Ministers would be able to Tam per with the Royal Charter At -- tamper with the Royal Charter at any time. Will she address that? Leveson said that the recognition panel must be independent of the press. Yet, the Royal Charter as currently drafted allows the press to be part of the appointment process to the very body whose job is to guarantee the independence of the system. Will she take the press out of the appointment system? Will she undertake to come forward with changes to the recognition criteria so that what is in the Royal Charter matches rather than dilutes Leveson? Leveson's report was published in November and there is a growing impatience for it to be  The December debate in this Housemaid that clear. And the vote in the Lords on the defamation bill last week showed there will be no acceptance of Leveson being watered-down or kicked into the  We will be reasonable  but we will be robust. We have an opportunity to make an important change which has been needed for decades. We must ensure that what the press did to the  to the McCanns, and so many others, who suffered so terribly and whose lives were made a misery can never happen again. Their heart-rending evidence to Leveson is the unanswerable case for lasting change. A big responsibility falls on us and history will judge us as having failed in our duty if we do not implement Leveson and do so now.  I have to say I will start my comments by thanking the honourable lady for the work that we have been doing together and the opportunity today to be able to clarify some of the points she has  She is right to start by making sure that we all focus on the group of people we need to, which is the victims. The honourable lady knows that the Conservative Party, myself, the Prime Minister, are absolutely committed to implementing the principles in Leveson. She and her choice of words may need to reconsider advocating implementing Leveson in full as she just cited. She will know that that is not what her party advocates and it isn't what our party advocates either. There are very clear recommendations around data protection and indeed the use of Ofcom as the verifying body that I know that she has already expressed deep concerns about. I am sure she didn't mean to say that she would advocate the full implementation of  She rightly says that if we are to take a Royal Charter approach - I was pleased to see there wasn't a wholehearted rejection of that approach when we put it forward yesterday - that we do need to make sure that it is something that can't be tampered  She will know that having looked at the Charter itself, that we have made very clear provisions that that is not possible and that I would very much welcome her intervening on me now to give her party's clear undertaking that that would not be an approach that she  She can take from the Conservative Party that there is no way that we would ever want to tamper with a Royal Charter and I'm sure that she would be able to give those undertakings, too. She also raised the issue of the appointment  She is right that this needs to be independent and that is why we have taken the approach that we have which is to involve the Commissioner for Public Appointments and to make sure that we are following the good practice that we have around appointments to organisations that are similar to  I have to say that some of the bodys that are involved in the conversations around the Leveson  such as Hacked Off have proposed involving politicians and the press in an appointments  That is something that we would whole heartedly reject. We don't think that that is right. We know that the appointments process for the verification body needs to be independent and for those that have read the details of what we are proposing, they will be able to see that is what we are doing. Mr  the honourable lady also outlined concerns around the recognition criteria. And she's  that we need to make sure that we pay very full regard to the criteria as set out in the Leveson  That is why we have used his recommendations as the basis for that section of the Royal  Clearly, we have to make sure that they work in practice, remove any uncertainty and any concerns about clarity because she  I know, would agree that as we move forward certainty and clarity are vital when it comes to  The Liberal Democrats have always been clear that we would prefer independent press regulation backed by statute rather than a Royal Charter. We do accept a Royal Charter could work. Unfortunately, the draft Royal Charter currently fails to meet the general requirements set out by  And regardless of what political parties might say now, would the Secretary of State accept that as it stands, there is nothing to protect the Charter in law from being amended by a future Government through the Privy We will continue to work together through this cross-party process to make sure we come to consensus. I completely understand his desire to make sure that any verification body has clarity, certainty and  That is why we have put on the charter a very clear provision which states clearly that any changes would have to have the full support of three party leaders  indeed, a two-thirds majority vote in both Houses of Parliament. I believe that provides the certainty my honourable friend is They ask the Secretary of State about data protection? I acknowledge that expressed concerns about Leveson's chapter on data  But in 2009, both sides of this House agreed to change the Data Protection Act to provide for a two year maximum jail sentence for breach of the jailed -- data protection rules with a Clear defence for journalists. We've been asking for four years for that to be brought into force. Can the Secretary of State say what possible reason there is for not bringing this a very important  which is not about captain -- catching journalists out, but about catching people who trade in data unlawfully and are getting away with it at the moment? The honourable gentleman raised this in the last debate we had on the subject and they understand the depth of feeling he has here. There are numerous changes going on here, particularly with regard to EU regulations. I'm looking and consulting about this very carefully so we can make one set of changes rather than having a slightly more piecemeal approach. Does my honourable friend agree there is a considerable public impatience to have a new strong regulator in place as soon as possible? Will she now we have the size to the industry a need for them to reach agreement swiftly?  well she confirm that her approach will ensure the new body it conforms with all of Lord Leveson is recommendations? -- Lord  He is right, momentum is  People want to see  I think that is clearly a message that has gone to the press and is certainly something we  As someone who has expressed my long-standing repugnance towards statutory regulation of the press, may I point out to the right honourable lady that it is getting on for three months since the Leveson report was published, with the Government saying they would act  that the press continued to wriggle out of any agreement or any responsibility, and are seeking to abolish the licensing hours for the last chance saloon? Will she make absolutely clear that this is unacceptable, and will she set a  and if that deadline is reached without agreement by the  this House will have that? I think the honourable gentleman makes a powerful point. I perhaps reassure him by saying the self- regulatory approach Leveson advocated is something which does require the press to put together a new regulatory regime. Every indication I have is that is what is happening, and the publication of the Royal Charter yesterday for an oversight body is our contribution did doing exactly what he is calling for, which is to get the action through as swiftly as it  Putting in place a chartered body will take significantly less time than some of the recommendations from other quarters. The first reaction the scandal in this place is to call for statutory  Meyer urged colleagues to learn from personal experience? Perhaps we should call the new statutory regulator the Independent Press Standards Authority? I thank my honourable friend the that intervention. He is absolutely  but I would underline to him that this would be the toughest press regulation that this country had ever seen. �1 million fines if you are not a member of the body to be subject to exemplary damages - these are not against the press want to see. -- these are not The Prime Minister looked the Milly Dowler family in the eye and said he would enact the Leveson report in full. Do you think that what does he think he owes them explanation?We want to make sure that the self-regulatory approach we take and the oversight of that is fully independent of both the press and the Government. I think he might agree with me that having a charter that is not subject to potentially continuous amendment by this House may give us that result. Would my right honourable friend agree it would be appropriate for Lord leather cent to come to this House to undergo scrutiny on aspects of his report? I know this is an issue the committee has  it is something that obviously Lord Justice Leveson we need to respond directly to. I can reassure my honourable friend that I will always be available to come to the committee and give the rationale for the approach we are  Can public confidence actually be restored without all- party agreement? The honourable member is right, there needs to be a consensual approach. That's why I'm pleased that we've been working to get to a point where all parties  The Conservative Party published the Royal Charter yesterday as a way to move that process forward, and I was pleased to see it was not rejected, that we will be having their the cross- party talks tomorrow, and I think  we need a consensus. If these measures had been in place, would they have made any less likely the scandals that led to the Leveson report? Name it, the failure of the police to respond to phone hacking, and criminal libel of the McCann family by the Sunday Express? A my right honourable colleague is right to raise the issue of the police and the comments made in the report with regards to their role. I hope he has noted the secretary's report of yesterday where she took up those issues that Lord Leveson raised. But I think I would make one further point - it is not just the culture of the police force but the press as well. I think the top self-regulatory approach set out will do a great deal to make sure that that culture within the press is somewhere they could not see these abuses happen again. I wished asked about the insertion of conscience clauses that would enable journalist to reject and it -- and refused any instruction from the editor or employer that counters the new rules. The editors are not engaging in meaningful discussions about this recommendation calls stop could the Government urged all sides to come together to meet and discuss effectively the introduction of a conscience clause, because this would give further protection to everybody concerned? Clearly that is something for the editors to  and I hear the point that  that is is important we have integrity. I am sure that will be listened to by those outside his  I congratulate the Minister for coming up with proposals that avoid legislation, but she has failed to fully satisfy either side in this debate. Could she say how they are viewed by the local press and what representation they will have under future structures? I hope that by trying to take the Leveson proposals and make them  we will come to something everyone feels makes the situation better in the future. But she is right to raise the issue of local  I know in their deliberations around the new self- regulatory body that the press industry themselves are looking at this in some detail. It is for them to work out how local press are accommodated, but I would echo her  particularly given, as we  the financially difficult times local press face, and remembering that they are not necessarily the architects of the problems we are trying to address. I think that does need to be  Could I thank the Secretary of State for a statement today? But as part of ongoing talks about press standards and press  could the Secretary of State update a house on discussions that she and her officials have had with the devolved institutions, and the possibility of the impact of such a royal charter in a place like Northern Ireland, where press standards are of the utmost importance? The honourable lady is right to raise the issue of devolved authorities, and we are thinking about this. I know particularly when it comes to  there are issues with regards to be approached the Scottish government might be taking. Our approach is we need to have commonality if possible, so publishers have one set of regulatory provisions to deal with, if that is at all possible. A vital principle which underpins democracy is freedom of the press from statutory legislation. My right honourable friend today has proposed a system of regulation based on the Royal Charter, but she describes this as a basis for  Can she assure us that the vital principle of non- statutory regulation will be maintained? Again absolutely give my honourable friend that undertaking. We believe we can achieve the aims and principles without taking a statutory approach, and I believe the royal charter Pope -- published yesterday gives us those grounds. The real problem with the royal charter process is it is the most autocratic tool in any government's weaponry, because it is easily changed at will by a  and no government can bind its successor, unless it is underpinned by statute. When most people think this is a shabby deal between the Government and proprietors when the Government promised last year it would publish meetings with proprietors and Government Ministers, and it hasn't done so since last June? Mustn't it publish these tomorrow before the meeting? The honourable gentleman knows that those meetings get published in the usual way. If you can let me answer his comment, his  with regard to the amend ability of a charter, he can absolutely EC -- see that there are provisions that mean it cannot be tampered with. The final point I would make is the honourable gentleman can give no guarantee of a press bill not being changed.  this Parliamentary process we have leaves any bill that comes before this House subject to amendment. We believe that a charter approach gives us something which is actually a far clearer way of providing the sort of freedoms of speech that we want for the press in this country in  Every time the press make up the story, they effectively deceive my constituents to bide their newspapers. When can my constituents expect to have proper protection from deception in newspapers? My honourable friend will know that the editors code already set out clear provisions to achieve that. This new approach that Lord Leveson has set out what,  underlined the importance of the culture in our press. We are working swiftly to make sure this comes into play, and I have to say that by implementing a Royal  we can do that more swiftly than a bill which would go through Parliament. Public trust, both in the media and in this House, is the big issue that is to be discussed in relation to Leveson. How can the public trust that what is coming out on government is not a political compromise, rather than something that will protect the public from the abuse they have faced in the past? Be clear assurance I can give to the honourable lady is the assurance the Prime Minister gave a, that we agree in fall with the Leveson  and we are taking us  I find it difficult to feel anyone would think that the press facing �1 million fines is anything other than the toughest form of regulation that this While I think it is important that we do not allow room full ministerial interference, I welcome the progress. I would like clarity  Part of the goal here is evening out there playing field between David and Goliath. Surely part of that requires arbitration to be free for complainants? Free as it is at the moment. My honourable friend is right to raise the issue of access to justice and he will know from reading Lord Justice Leveson's report that he feels it is important to have a cost-effective process and there is ready access. We are trying to take that objective to make it work actually in the way it works in many other areas of the law, in terms of tribunal access, and that that will be a very low cost system. Above  they would always be free to put forward any complaints and internal complaints process will continue to be free at the point of  Yesterday the father of Madeleine McCann said this, this royal charter plan falls far short  The Conservative Party conference rewrite Leveson now, they must think again. Doesn't the reaction show of that this plan fails the very test the Prime Minister himself set out in his evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, victims of press abuse in this country?The honourable gentleman will know we are making a 2000 page document and making it work. That has been our objective, absolutely every step of the way. None of the main political parties in this house agree with every single recommendation that that Lord Justice Leveson has bought out, we have already outlined the issues that both sides of the house have with regards to data protection and the potential roles of Ofcom that were outlined in his report. He will have to understand that it is making this work in practice, which is what has been our central drive over the last two to three months. We will continue to do so, making sure that the four principles of Leveson are put in place. I think we owe that to the people we are trying to support. I certainly welcome the proposals my right honourable friend is putting forward. Can she confirmed that it will not be compulsory for publications to sign up to the new body if they don't feel the need to do so? I think that freedom is important even if it means they are taking more of a risk by staying outside. My honourable friend will know from the provisions in the Leveson report that there is no compulsion  He has formed his recommendations on the basis of the use of incentives and that is where the clauses around defamation, around the exemplary damages come  I think that provides the sort of incentive that publications who feel they are at risk in this area it need. For those publications that don't feel they are at risk, they may choose not to be a member of the new self regulatory body. That is their decision. Last week that select committee heard from the representatives from the Irish Press Council and made two important points. One was the important role that the NUJ play in the process over there. Secondly they are bemused many with the discontent shown by proprietors in this country and discontent with legislation in Ireland. Could she explain why? I'm not sure I can explain any discontent coming from editors with regard to that. Sorry, with  Perhaps you would need to call them to committee and question them closely. Just to say very clearly that what I have seen from the press is an absolute desire to engage and put in place a sort of self regulatory body that Lord Justice Leveson has called for, but in parallel with that, it is absolutely timely that we also make sure that the verification body that plays such an important part is also in place otherwise we will not have the ability to implement a Leveson in full. That is why cross- party talks are important and we need consensus. I think we need to be really clear on that point. Can I welcome the progress that has  in particular the agreement from the government that some statute is required in order to create incentives to join such a  I also acknowledge that a royal charter could be an alternative way of establishing an independent body providing their criteria are right. Can she explain what happens if there is no regulator that is worthy of recognition in the view of the recognition by the? Is it the case that in that in some -- incident, all newspapers will be subject to fines or will it be the case that we have no system at all? It is the  On a day when six more former journalists of the News of the World have been arrested, including two sitting Sun journalists on charges which police say represent a new conspiracy in the phone hacking a scandal, isn't it even more important than ever that the Secretary of State show some urgency about action because, and less real action is taken and the real four principles of Leveson are implemented, the public will not forgive her? De honourable gentleman is right that the urgency is absolutely  Momentum is important, that is why we publish the royal charter document yesterday and I was pleased to see there was a general acceptance that this could be a way  that we have further cross-party talks tomorrow. As the point was made earlier, we do need to have a consensus on this. This is the point in time when that consensus can start to be formed. Whatever proposal passes this house, surely the important thing is that the culture of the price changes and shouldn't we, as the government, set an example? One of the criticisms was that the government and press were getting too close  yet earlier this week, on  we had the social care  It was widely leaked so the press the previous weekend. Favourite to journalists given advance information. The government has to stop this. My honourable friend is right that it is a culture issue. I raise this before in my comments and we need to make sure that the particular clause around transparency are  This has been a subject that is part of cross-party  We have formulated a paper on that which is with the opposition at the moment. I hope that in further discussions we can pick up on the issue of transparency again. Consensus is very important, but what I am hearing from the Secretary of State is it is consensus on my terms. It is consensus that takes away any suggestion that they could be statutory underpinning and undermines a lot of other recommendations. That is not consensus, is it? A I think the honourable lady should be focusing on the ends, not  All of our parties, I  agree with the principles in  All of our parties agree that we would not want to see the Leveson report implemented in full. What we have to do is work together in the environment that we find ourselves and come to an agreement. We believe that the charter document provides a way of getting to absolutely the same ends, but just by different means. Does the Secretary of State accept that whenever statutory underpinning is being promoted, we need to remember that it runs the risk of a future minister restricting press activity that is genuinely in the public interest?  can she reassure me that principles of Leveson can be delivered without a statutory underpinning? I can absolutely give my honourable friend that assurance. I think there is a philosophical difference in our approach is between parties, but I don't think it is unbridgeable. I will continue to try and work with both Liberal Democrat and the Labour Party to come to an agreement on this. Otherwise we run the risk of not moving forward with Leveson and I think that would be inexcusable and unforgivable. All the local newspapers in Yorkshire and the North were unanimous that they did not want Parliament bearing down on them, they just want to hold local organisations and politicians to  Could I urge her to push forward quickly with proposals. They are excellent, well done. I thank my honourable friend for that an endorsement of the approach we are taking, but I think he is making an important point which is we have to understand that our local papers are a vital part of our local communities. We need to make sure they can continue to be  that they don't fall foul of an approach which actually was not designed to deal with them all  but was designed to deal with abuses in other areas of  I think he makes an important point. My right honourable friend has said that the government totally accepts the main principles of Lord Justice Leveson's report. My right honourable friend also suggests that the main recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson's report are  Is it possible for these recommendations to be instituted without some form of statutory underpinning? My honourable friend is raising the issue of the criteria and the approach of Leveson and we believe that that can be affected in the main part without having statutory underpinning. What we have been talking about is the importance of recognising the exemplary damages through statute and that would need to be in place to make sure that that is as effective as it needs to be to make sure that this balance of provisions that Leveson has put forward work in the way he intended. Point of order, Mr Chris Bryant. I hope the Secretary of State will stay for this briefly. I hope he will confirm, Mr Speaker, that there is a process in this house for a minister to correct what they have said when they have inadvertently misled it. The Secretary said earlier that details of meetings between proprietors and newspaper editors and government ministers are published in the ordinary way, all the normal way,  In actual fact, they have not been published in normal ordinary way for eight months. At a time when Averis sensitive issue is being debated by government and bringing forward proposals in relation to the newspaper industry, I think voters would expect complete transparency on the matter.  can't she, correct the record? It is open for the minister to correct the record if she has made a mistake and judges it necessary to do so. She can respond  but is under no obligation to  The honourable gentleman has raised his point and I have given him his answer.

Have you had any notice from ministers in either the Home Office or DC ms that they won't wish to correct the record of answers to me regarding a report prepared by an operation on ticket crime? I ask because ministers responded to my requests for them to places document in the library by saying the information it contained was operationally sensitive. Because I haven't copy in my possession, I know it does not contain sensitive information and it clearly says on the front that it is not protectively marked and suitable for the publication scheme. I am also a way it has been distributed to commercial organisations.

I beg to move that the police grant report the 2013 and 14, which was laid before this House on 4th  be approved. I am grateful to the honourable members who have joined me today to take part in this debate on the funding  In addition to seeking your approval of this report, I also want to focus on how we are reforming the police to make them more effective, efficient and responsive to local needs. On 19th  my right honourable friend the Member for Ashford laid before this has a written ministerial statement and a provisional police grant report which set out the Government's proposed allegations of grants to police in England and Wales. We have decided that forced level allegations will remain as announced on that date. But before I get to the details of that announcement, Mr Speaker, it is important to set this debate in some contexts. When our coalition government came to office in 20th  Britain had the largest peacetime deficit in our history.  the Labour government raised in tax, it raised �4.

I have been the first to acknowledge that we should have said in our manifesto, vote Lib Dem and crime will be the lowest level in recorded history. But we were insufficiently bold. We were too  actually, about the contribution we would make to the well-being of our country. I want to come to the only two conclusions that can be reasonably drawn from Labour's to back catastrophic periods in office. -- Labour's two catastrophic period. Either we had been very unlucky to have especially inept Labour politicians, in which case it seems strange indeed to be enlisting the most culpable Cabinet Ministers from the last regime to run the show for  all, perhaps there is a more fundamental conclusion, which is based.

I am grateful to have this early opportunity to tell the House what happened to crime in the West Midlands since my party came to  since this coalition  Which is that crime has fallen in the West Midlands. As I  the two things that make Labour MPs look most glam is finding out constituents are more likely to get a job or less likely to be victims of crime. Crime in the West Midlands in the last two years has fallen by 13%. It is an extraordinary achievement and if I was representing a West Midlands constituency, I would be pleased that my constituents were less likely to be victims of crime than they were in 2010. I find it extraordinary that Labour MPs do not take that view. Will the honourable member answer  I bow to no one in my admiration about how excellent West Midlands Police Service is. The leadership of its police and crime commissioner and the leadership of the chief constable. Can the right honourable gentleman begin to explain the unfairness of approach that has seen 814 Police officers go in Birmingham, but 257 additional police officers in Surrey? I have already explained, crime has fallen by 13% in the West Midlands. The purpose of the police is not to employ as many people as possible, the purpose of the police is to make the public as safe as possible and to reduce the amount of crime. That is what is happening. Crime, since the survey of England and Wales began in 1981, it seems hard to believe that I was at primary school in 1981, since that survey  crime has never been lower in England and Wales than it is  It is an extraordinary  I won't give way. Why doesn't the honourable gentleman reflect on that achievement? Why do they all look so sour and unhappy that their constituents are less likely to be victims of crime under this government? What I was talking  I will give way in a bit. What I was talking about is the budgetary context. His West Midlands colleague, the shame less Member for Birmingham Hodge Hill he said there was no money left, and I note he did not say there was a little bit of money left or there is a little bit of money, I wish there was a bit more. There was, in  no money left. That was the reality of our inheritance. Our coalition government, working in the national interest, is turning the oil tank around. The deficit has been cut by a quarter over two years and around 1 million private sector jobs have been created. Tidying up labour's mess is a difficult and painstaking process that cannot be achieved overnight. In order to deal with the deficit, tough decisions have to be made. They have to be made. Members opposite to have never made a tough decision in their lives, I know find this traumatic, but they have  There is therefore less money for the Home Office and less money for the police. As a service that was spending in excess of �14 billion per year, the police can and must take their fair share of reductions in funding. As set out in the Policing Minister has written ministerial statement, central government funding to the police will be �8.7 billion in 2013  Only 1.9% less than in 2012,  It is important to stress that the police do not receive all of their funding from central  They receive a quarter from council tax which is determined locally. We have sought to protect the police as far as  The autumn statement in December included further cuts of 1% to most departmental budgets.  the Home Secretary decided to protect the police from these additional reductions in 2013, 14.  the Home Secretary decided not to pass on the reductions relating to the 20th November 11 announcement on pay restraint which could have resulted in a further reduction of �66 billion in police funding in 2013, 14. All of this means that in 2013, 14 police will receive the same amount of funding that was agreed in the 20th October 10 spending review. Naturally, police and crime commissioners are keen to know what their funding allocations will be for 2014/15 and whether the departmental reductions announced in the Autumn Statement and the impact of pay restraint will be passed on to the police in  We will announce our decision as soon as we are in a position to do so with regards to  Let me just finish this  The reduction to the police budget has coincided with a small reduction in the number of  but ultimately the decisions on the size and composition of the work force, of individual officers and police and crime commissioners.

What is interesting is that in the county where members of parliament are all on the government side of  we are not showering money due to the political colour of the Members of Parliament in the council's at one area of the country over another. That is something that Labour members may wish to reflect upon, but we are keen that the funding allocations  I will speak about that in more detail later, but it is it worth also bringing to the house's attention that in the last year  in Dorset, crime has fallen  That is also a significant achievement and means people in Dorset are safer than they were when Labour was in government. Despite the valiant efforts of the West Midlands Police Service, figures last year demonstrate 3684 fewer crimes solved. Can I repeat the question? It may be a vain attempt to get an answer from the honourable gentleman speaking to his -- speaking from his script. How can he begin to justify a 814 police officers are going in Birmingham, but to 257 extra officers in Surrey? Howl is that justified?  there are fewer crimes solved because there are fewer  He obviously missed it the  actually, this is just in the last year, this is how much progress has been made and I recognise that every crime has a victim and I want to see crime go  I am really genuinely pleased that crime is lower now than at the last general election when his party got the second worst result in their history and did well to do as well as that. Crime has fallen in the West Midlands in the last year, not by 5%, not by 10 or even 11 or 12, but by 13%. That has got to beat... Surely we can agree that our constituents, being less likely to be victims of crime is a good thing. However partisan Labour MPs are, surely they don't want to see their constituents more likely to be victims of crime just so they can try and score points across the house. I want to make progress and then I will give way  I have given way several times to Labour MPs who all seem to want to make the same point, which is they are upset that crime is  If anybody wants to tell  if a Labour MP wants to intervene because crime has risen in their area, they can get up. Anyone? Go on. Go on! No, it hasn't risen in yours down. I will get on.  While there has been much debate about the number of police officers, and that was the point made by the honourable  surely the most salient fact is this, crime is falling. While total office and numbers fell 9% is same SEP- 2011 and 20th September 12, most recent statistics show a 7% reduction in police recorded crime over the same period and an even bigger reduction in the Independent crime Survey figures for crime in England and  Let me turn... I will give way to anybody who has seen an increase in crime. To be honest, there has been an increase in Devon and Cornwall, but I can't see any members here. Every single Labour MP represented here today has a reason to be grateful to the police and this government for overseeing the lowest period of crime since the survey began 32 years ago. I will get to the details because there are some members here who are genuinely interested in the funding of police rather than trying to score political points. I owe it to them to treat them seriously. Let me turn to the funding settlement  In the past 12 months, we have heard from policing partners on a number of funding issues including police allocation formula, a point raised by my honourable friend for Dorset. The process of damping and the community safety  There is a widely held view that police allocation formulas should be subject to a full review before any changes are made to the current dumping policy. We will commence a review later this year and therefore for the meantime the current damping arrangements will  but a review will be undertaken on whether we can improve the allocation of central police funding. Linked to the issue of allocations is the matter of the  the police element of the council tax. So I do recognise there is considerable disparity between areas in the proportion of overall funding that comes from council tax however we have to ensure that the funding allocations to the police are as equitable as  This is the reason why all forces have received an equal percentage of the reduction in call government funding. In terms of community safety funding, in  PCC's will also receive funding from a new and and ring- fenced transitional community safety fund which they can use to invest in tackling drugs, crime or in community safety activities. In  this funding totals �90  PCC's will have discretion to invest funding from the CFRS, the community safety fund, in their own locally determined priorities, including existing programmes. This fund provides the full flexibility to invest in their own priorities. To ensure that PCCs are able to make an informed decision on the using allocations, we will publish details on the existing drugs crime and community safety funding streams that are ending on the Home Office website. From 2014/15th the community safety fund will be rolled into the main grant to give PCCs greater freedom and flexibility over how they use  In summary, we cannot afford to continue the borrowing levels of spending of the previous  The fact that crime continues to fall shows that the quality of policing cannot and should not be measured purely in terms of the levels of resources In Northumbria, the PCC and the Chief Constable are proposing to increase the precept by a cost on average of less than five p per household to recruit 50 additional  Will it on the Mobil -- will the honourable gentleman tell me if he agrees with that or not?

If she is accusing me of being to party  it is worth pointing out that crime was falling when John Major was Prime Minister. What is notable is that Labour MPs used to say when they were in government that the reason crime was falling is because they were spending more money on the police. But now, because of their complete fiscal incompetence, we are spending marginally less money and we have lower crime than when Labour was in office and the lowest level of independently recorded crime in the survey since it began over 30 years  Surely that is good news? I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledge rising the point made by my friend. The crime rate has fallen every year consistently  including every year of the last Labour government. It was not necessarily about police  Doesn't he recognise it was actually to do with shifting police resources into neighbourhood policing teams that we started to see the biggest fundamental drop in crime under the last government?

Those plans will set the scale of their ambition for the future, but already they had began to demonstrate that they are driving forward innovative, flexible use of their budgets and taking bold  We have already seen evidence of that leadership, with Forces looking seriously at how they managed their estate, including the future of the Scotland Yard here in London.

I think it is �12 million. So the vast budget -- majority of the budgets will not be transferring to  So it is not accurate to conflate those budgets and say that between them those budgets are bigger than the NCAs -- NCA's  Few things could be more directly relevant to public confidence and the British model of policing by consent than the integrity of our police officers. Police officers are the cities and in uniform and their fellow citizens must be able to have confidence that they exercise their powers without fear or favour. That is why the Home Secretary announced a range of measures to enhance police integrity in this House  Greater independent investigation of the most serious and sensitive complaints against the police will be made possible by the balancing resources between the IPCC and forced professional standards director its -- directorates. We will strengthen the batting of senior officers and we will introduce national registers of pay and perks, gifts and hospitality, contact with the media and outside interests. All of this will be underpinned by a code of ethics for the police, a single set of ethical standards by which officers and staff will work. The college will develop this and PCC's and chief officers will insure it runs right through the careers of police officers. A -- and PCCs will  We also rely on being able to continue to attract the very best people into policing.

My honourable friend makes a good point and I imagine many people with military backgrounds would be ideally suited to pursuing his career option.

It is important that all people who murdered police officers are brought to justice, and if there is evidence to bring them to justice, that should be brought forward. As I said, there is a clear difference between the government and the opposition on  The settlement today before the House continues a path which the Labour opposition has opposed since 2010, and I give little hint to the Minister today that we will do so again today. The proposal before us means we are going to see a loss of around �2 billion over three years from the police budget in England and Wales. The Conservatives, and by dint of  the Liberal Democrats, are cutting police funding by 20% over that three-year period. 15,000 officers are going to be lost by  and 7,000 officers have been lost already in the first two years of this government. More than the experts predicted would be lost, more than the HMRC said was safe, and it is damaging, in my view, to morale and the services involved. He has consistently opposed what the government has said, but could he be clear what he would suggest instead? What is the right amount of money and where would he get it from? One thing is clear, in the police grant debate of 2010, I stood where the minister stands as the policing minister, we propose to 12% in the budget over three  I know the Honourable Gentleman for Cambridge was not here at the time, but his Honourable Friend for Chesterfield, criticised the Budget at the time and reminded us that the Liberal  including the member for Cambridge went into the election promising 3,000 more police officers on the beat.

The current  the Liberal Democrat government which he supports, is proposing the third year of a 20% reduction in spending on policing at a time when this Minister stood in his constituency, as did the other Liberal-Democrat members, on a pledge to bring in 3,000 more police officers. I would like to let the Minister intervene. Let me  at what point during the election did he say he would preside over 345 police officers being cut in his own constituency?

He has sold his soul to government  I say to the Honourable Gentleman that he knows we would have cut 12% from the police budget. We would have cut �1 billion over a three-year period, including the year of this grant, and we would have done that because that is what we said we would do. I have to say to the Honourable Gentleman that at the time of the last debate I recall him debating with me about police numbers before the general election and I quote from the debate in Hansard on 27th October,  people like to see a visible police presence in their communities. I am genuinely astonished that the Conservatives want to make drastic cuts to that  And the Honourable  the minister, in the same debate talking about his Conservative council in Somerset, he said they were cutting funding from the police, keeping it secret before the county council elections  I have to say, who 000 police officer is now cutting 20% of the Budget, and you can't get more secret than that. There then Honourable Member for Chesterfield in response to the  who lost his seat at the  said such cuts, should they snowball and continue in the next year or two will be a tragedy. That was the Member for Chesterfield speaking from the Liberal Democrat front benches. I suspect that the Honourable Gentleman won't listen to me. I accept that. We have had honest debate and I have seen more of him in the last three weeks then I've seen of my wife. We will not come to a meeting of minds on this, but perhaps he could listen to some of .. I will give way.Just to interrupt this Prix Valentine's Day discussion between you and the  but in committee, did you will consider the budgets of the various organisations that were being set up by the government, and does he share my concern that the sums don't add up? Where has all the money gone, bearing in mind of the responsibilities are going to be transferred to these new organisations? Did he manage to -- managed to elicit any more information than I did from the minister? A I have to say we did explore in some details the difference for the budget of the organisations. And we did shed some light on the fact that there is a major gap in the level of funding, but we couldn't get any particular answers as to where that level of funding had disappeared to. I suspect that the Right Honourable  leading as he does so ably the select committee, might wish to explore the matter in detail over the next few weeks. Let me say to the Honourable Gentleman, we will not have a meeting of minds between myself and himself on this  Perhaps he can listen to a few voices in the community. For  an individual who shall remain nameless for the moment,  I want the public to understand how tight things really  because there is a feeling out there that it is OK. That was the Conservative police and crime commissioner, John Dwyer, in  complaining about the fact that he will have to bring forward a budget which axes 38 police officers and 25 back office  In the Essex news this week, Nick Huddlestone, the Conservative police and crime Commissioner for  on taking office, the force's financial position is even more challenging than I suspected when taking office only two months The Commissioner for Cornwall said,  this is a freezing of  and it will leave the force with a fiscal cliff in two years' time, and an annual shortfall of �1.8 million. There will be a critical reduction in proactive crime reduction, as well as in partnership, community, early intervention and other areas. I look forward to the Honourable Member for Cornwall, amongst others, voting for this budget today, because the police and crime commission are locally thinks this budget will cause great difficulties in Cornwall. The police and crime commissioner in Gloucestershire says, and I quote, we will not be able to absorb the cuts the Government expects us to make in subsequent years, which could affect frontline services and our ability to reduce crime. If we use our reserves, as suggested, we will have no money left to buy equipment or improve infrastructure. And the Cumbrian crime commissioner, again not a Labour member, has said, this is a challenging position, indicating that more than �10 million worth of savings will have to be delivered up to 2017, and further savings of �12 million have been made already. Those are police and crime commissioners, not Labour  happy to raise concerns  I am grateful to my Right Honourable Friend. Is it not the case that we cannot take this debate in isolation of the next  on the local government settlement? Is it not the case that  a great deal of work and progress was carried out by the various crime and disorder reduction partnerships, with local  housing associations and the police forces working in partnership? Is the danger not that all of this will be wiped out? You're right. The minister said, how do we reduce crime? I would remind him that crime did fall in every year of the Labour government, and is falling now. I welcome that fall in crime, I think it is a good  I do not want to see people in my constituency facing criminal  or being victims. But the key thing he needs to reflect upon is that there are areas now where crime is starting to rise. Areas such as street crime, burglary and  car theft, where it is starting to rise. And also, he needs to recognise that policing is not just about discovering crime. Policing is also -- is also about community reassurance, the invisible and meeting many tasks, even such as football ground  which do not involve solving crime, but still involve providing a presence and a community resource. I am most  My Right Honourable Friend will know that we believe one of the great successes of the Labour government in reducing crime was through the safer neighbourhood partnerships. Indeed, also, from the neighbourhood teams, so is he aware that the Mayor Of London is now proposing that there will only  one PCSO and no dedicated sergeant in these teams? Surely that is the way to reduce community confidence and possibly allow for an increasing crime? -- increase in crime. The Mayor of London is facing a situation where there are fewer officers serving in the Met than the number which was inherited from Ken Livingstone. In quoting the various police and Crown Commissioners from government  my Honourable Friend quite well exposes the very real problems which have been imposed by the Government on police forces the length and breadth of the country. But in the high crime areas, the cuts are even deeper. Can he say something about the disproportionate nature of the way these cuts are falling? In the West  for example, a high-crime  the cuts are deeper than they are across the nation as a whole. I am grateful to him for raising that  The West Midlands police force has lost more than 1,600 police officers over the past two  I know that the police and crime commissioner is trying to address those issues, but it is a really serious issue. I am grateful. One of the issues when I speak to my chief inspector, and to the police in my area, is that resources have been cut, and whilst crime is diminishing, it is not doing so in all areas. This is only a short term trend, but the trend is going to be upwards. The reason for that is that when the Labour government introduced neighbourhood  we had crime mapping. In those crime maps, we were able to identify serious criminals and low- level criminals. Today, those crime maps have eroded because PCSOs and sergeants have been moved into  forced into the back  to cover for other  so we have got a diminishing neighbourhood policing  with crime maps falling into  Soon, crime will start rising if we do not keep up with neighbourhood policing. I am grateful to him for raising that  In his own force in Lancashire, he has lost 430  The minister, Mr Deputy  keeps chuntering from a sedentary position, saying, what is the impact upon that?

I simply say  there are trans, and he  on violent crime, one detection rates, on recording of  on visible presence, where the trend is in a different  I genuinely hope crime continues to fall, but we have to make that assessment. Our concern is that it will be more difficult, with �1 billion taken out of the budget over three years. The I give  I just wanted to check that, given everything he says, he is now committing to taking �1 billion out of other areas of government spending - say, schools and hospitals - to fund this area? He is not just making a completely empty speech to get some cheers from his backbenchers? We are 7 billion - what would he be spending? Just a number... Mr Deputy Speaker, the Honourable Gentleman must be, as well as many  not listening to what  You will have heard that this is the third year of a three-year budget proposal. We proposed 12 coffee cups. He is proposing 20% cuts. Next year and the year after, we will have a further debate, and when the Labour government is returned in two  we will have a look at  But at the moment we are talking about the third year of  He needs to listen to what I have said. I thank him for  and he is making the case that there could be a delay before we see crime levels going up, but how long does he think that would become and how many years will we have to continue seeing crime going down before he accepts what is really happening? Crime has been falling over many years, and that has been continuing since 1995, the about the time I have been in this House of Commons. The key question is to look at how we develop over the future. I would say to him that policing is about,  catching criminals, solving crimes and dealing with those issues. But it is also about community reassurance, dealing with  dealing with football  crowd-control, demonstrations - none of those  Mr Deputy Speaker, are about policing crime. I would say to him that who are of the reason crime is falling is because the Labour government did good work in bringing together probation, prisons and pleasing to look at serious offenders, reducing serious  The number of first-time offenders going into the system fell under Labour. The number of offences per person also fell under  I would say to him, I just worry that there is the potential for difficulties to come downstream.  he does not need to listen to me - the member has just mention the new head of the College  This was from BBC News in January just gone - outgoing Hampshire chief constable warns on  Hampshire's outgoing Chief Constable has warned that further cuts to the budget could seriously impact upon policing services.

It is not just Conservative police and crime commissioners, nor Labour police and crime commissioners, it is professional police officers. When the Chief Constable of the West Midlands was pressed at the Home Affairs Select Committee on whether or not there would be an adverse effect on the police service in the West Midlands, he had to agree. The cut over four years or so is somewhere in the region of 26%.

I look forward to the Labour campaign in Eastleigh focusing on issues to do with crime and punishment. I look forward, Mr Deputy Speaker, to reminding the people of Eastleigh that the Liberal Democrats proposed 3,000 more police officers, and proposed tuition fees and various other issues that they have broken their  Let me just say, the Minister appears to have been injected with something over the last couple of hours, because he is really quite frisky. Throughout the course of his contribution, he does have to be hyper. Now, he has sat  he seems to be the same. I do not know who is going to win the by-election in Eastleigh, the people of where are will decide  But the key question they need to ask is, who is going to stand up against a coalition government? I suspect either a Liberal Democrat or a Conservative MP will do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think the Member for Cambridge has had his fair share. I have got to try to finish. There is much we could talk about, Mr Deputy Speaker, but one thing is built in - this settlement will damage policing still further. It will damage the ability of police officers to serve their communities. I think it is the wrong settlement. It is the third year of a very damaging  I want to stand up for  to stand up for our  and I urge my friends to reject this tawdry settlement.  Mr Deputy Speaker. Could I begin by quoting remarks from Her Majesty's opposition spokesman? I had the pleasure of working with him when I was the Shadow Policing  and I can say, he was a very effective representative for the Federated ranks, and he was one of nature's gentlemen. He  of course, many brave police officers, men and women, and we should never forget that, in the context of funding settlements and reformed pay and conditions. We do honour and respect what they do each day on our behalf. Now, it is worth saying something about the headline figures for the police The home affairs committee calculated there was a reduction up to 2008 of up to 20%. That was something that the conservative opposition supported and voted for. But it had the result of making the British police force one of the best resourced in the Western world. So when we are looking at reductions in spending, which we are in this settlement, no one  We have to see it in the context that it is coming off a very high base. The figures for 2013/14 represent, in total central government funding, at specific Home Office grant, the police court settlement grant and the GLC settlement grant. That comes up to 8 billion. But it is only a minus 9%. These are not staggering  but I repeat, against a backdrop of very high increases, ones that we supported in the decade up to 2008. I am happy to  I pay tribute to Dorset police in my constituency for the wonderful work they do. My friend was talking about the relatively small reduction, but if you run a force like Dorset, which is now bottom of the heap, that small reduction over many years is actually a massive reduction. If we had even the national police funding per capita, we would have an extra �16 million, an extra 50 officers on the beat. So for us, even a small reduction has an enormous effect. My Honourable Friend makes a very important point, and my police authority is not dissimilar to Dorset. It is Suffolk, and those on the police authority and serving senior officers make the point he has just made. Which is why are delighted to draw attention to what has not been sighted in the debate, which is that the Home Secretary has announced a clear intention to review the formula which churns out the grants for each authority. He wants to do that once the police and crime commissioners are bedded  so that they can be consulted on how the formula can be tweaked. And I am sure I like my Honourable  those rural forces like Dorset and Suffolk get a better deal and there is a better acknowledgement of the particular challenges of a police service covering very strung out areas,  and so on. I see my Honourable Friend the Member for Suffolk coastal in her seat, and I know that this is something she endorses as well. Do what I assume from what he is saying that he has an expectation that the review there will be undertaken by the Home Secretary will lead to yet more shifting resources from high- crime areas who have already been hit the hardest, to lower crime  I am a great fan of Dorset and I think it's a wonderful part  but it is not exactly the crime capital of England, is it? I'm not suggesting we do anything as crude as that. I'm suggesting that there are factors in sparsity that many in rural seats are not being taken into account that sufficiently. But clearly there has to be a process that is not just directing resources willy-nilly. We have to say that where there are high crime  those needs must be reflected in the formula. But the formula does need to be looked out. He will know, being a senior minister in the last government, how incredibly difficult it was to strike a balance and dumping it was the best policy one could do in the circumstance. I think the announcement of the review of the formula is something we should have a serious debate about, but I am  and rural members are clear that we will be putting our case for what we would say are better and more equitable rule  We also need to thank the Home Secretary and those on this side to take an interest in law and  for the doughty way in which she has fought the corner for the police service. What I mean by that is that she was able, in a very committed and forceful way, to ensure that the further 1% departmental reductions that the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Autumn Statement would not apply in 2013/14 to the police budget. She has also commuted the reductions which were going to float from the Chancellor's 20th November 11 statement -- November of 2011  She has protected the police budget from those strictures. We are not same that this -- we are not saying that this is the settlement that we would all like. We would all like more money for the services that serve our constituents, of course. But we cannot let this debate prompts without saying, once again, there is a national economic crisis --  I will not be critical about how it arose, but whoever is in government now, Labour or Conservative, or any possible combination of parties in coalition, would have to be making reductions. And they would be saying what, I  is undeniable. In the modern  governments need to do more  They need to get better results with constraints on public service budgets. And that means not just worrying if primarily, or  on the amount of money put into a service, but how the service is organised. And that is why the Home Secretary should be thanked again for the adrenalin shot she has given in the arm in the area of radical police reform. Getting more  She is in deep -- the fortunate position of being able to do this at a time when a fall in  and it seemed to be declining under the Labour government and it continues to decline under us, not withstanding the tight budget settlement that the police have been subject to. But the latest figures. I am happy to give way.Thank you to the Honourable Gentleman for giving way. Would he not accept that in my constituency we have lost 220 officers of the beat, so does he not accept that means that criminality will be on the street? Is it not about priorities? I have to say I do not accept that simple, direct correlation and I will explain in my remarks in a minute why I believe that to be the case. But there is a case that we see in the 12 months to September of 2012, the latest period in which crime Survey figures are reported, and 8% decrease in overall crime against adults in England and Wales. We also have figures which showed that in that survey the chance of being a victim of crime was, in the 12 months up to September of 2012, but that is the best figure since 1981. -- that that is the best figure. It should be a truth universally acknowledged that the effect of the police forced does not directly depend on the number of staff,  But rather, the way in which they are deployed. We have already heard that the Home Secretary has scrapped central targets and energised the drive by chief constables to reduce unnecessary process. That's not  it's the way officers  There have been some encouraging examples of what my Right Honourable Friend, who is in  the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee. I looked at the so-called pilot of a much quicker and sharper incident reporting regime by officers on the  We have seen a rolling back of statutory charging in relation to more triable offences, giving more discretion to the charging sergeant in the station, rather than he or she having to hang around on the telephone waiting for the CPS solicitor to give the charging authorisation. There are other examples. But what we do know  as a result of this crackdown on bureaucracy, which was memorably reported on by Sir Ronnie Flanagan in the second half of the last  progress is being made. And the results are there for us to see already. Now, the number of police officers in frontline roles is projected to increase by 2% between March of 2012 and marched  -- march of 2013. The proportion of frontline officers is expected to increase from the 83% which we inherited in 2010, to 89%  Another statistic is that I researched that in March of 2010, 17% of officers were in none of frontline roles. That was according to her Majesty's Inspectorate of  Fairly objective data  I feel. And the government is forecasting, through the policy measures it has announced, to bring this down to 10% by March of 2015. From my experience in the armed  the so-called backroom boys and girls, who were in my day members of the armed services were very useful to call upon in times  While I accept that the backroom boys and girls should be reduced to a certain degree, by getting rid of serving officers in  there is no reserve when the proverbial hits the fan. My Honourable Friend makes a good  but we should resist the temptation to believe that a Home Secretary or a policing minister in Whitehall can make decisions about the mix between uniformed back room staff who would be able to perform at short notice the kind of reserve back up on the front line my Honourable Friend describes, and pure civilians. It is a very long- running debate in the world of police reform. But what we do know is that it is for the chief constable to decide and make decisions accordingly. Whether my Honourable Friend accept that or  it must be something that any government would have to have in  witches -- which is to reduce the amount of the uniformed workforce that is in none from line  I just repeat the  In March of 2010, 17% of uniformed officers were in on front  It is our intention with the measures put in place to  so that only one in 10 of uniformed officers are in that none of frontline roles. -- non frontline roles. I would have thought that the opposition  who I thought was a very worthy and dedicated policing Minister in the last Parliament, would acknowledge that that must be a policy objective of governments and also chief constables and police commissioners. I'd like to say something not just about reducing bureaucracy as part of police reform, and getting more bang for our but -- Buck, doing more for less. That relates to what are undoubtedly difficult and controversial reforms to pay and When we are talking about funding settlements for the police service, in most police forces in England  a massive 80% of expenditure is on pay. So, yes, we can mandate collaboration, which this government is in the process  to make efficiencies in procurement, in information  uniform, traffic and so  but those and other heads of spending only amount to 20% of what a police force Spence, 80% is on  And therefore, it seems to me that it was incumbent on any Home Secretary, Labour or  to look afresh at how we get a modernised pay system,  crucially - and the former government did indicate that they supported this concept - pay progression with higher levels of  and those who have undertaken higher professional training - not performance by  but linking pay to the skills that officers have, and paying less attention to progress up the pay ladder simply by age.  of course, Windsor is more complicated than that, but it seems to me that the flexibility of chief .. And it is chief constables who will be making these managerial decisions, not ministers in Whitehall. They will be doing that in conjunction with their locally elected police and crime commissioners. It will be for them to make sure that they have the proper mix of ability within the uniformed ranks. But also, they will also have to make decisions about civilian ranks, to make the allegations which are being put before the House today, to make that money go further. Now, and would like to close by saying something about accountability. This money that will be voted for on this side of the House, and which acts think the Honourable Member suggested the opposition would vote against later on this  we have to get away from the idea that it will be ministers who were personally held  We vote the money. I want the message to go out that police and crime commissioners really will have the prime job of driving through the change to get more value for money. I know it is  but my early experience of the elected Commissioner in Suffolk is positive. He has put together a draft set of priorities. He has gone to the trouble of speaking to and meeting all the MPs  He has taken amendments to his first draft. My own view, which I think most police and crime commissioners should look at, is that they should set a target for the percentage of time that their officers are visible to the Suffolk  I think there should be an objective to get towards the 10% of uniformed officers, only 10% should be on non-front line activity, which is the national objective by  And they should hold themselves to account by explaining, in my case to the taxpayers of  and other commissioners in other police force areas up and down the country, what they are doing to reduce bureaucracy, to get more officers and a higher percentage of officers on the front  and to make sure that there are not just more of them on the  but that during their  they are spending a higher proportion of those shifts visibly out and about, so that the public can see them. I give way. I also want to pay tribute to him for sticking to his mandate in not increasing the precept, but also, he is bringing a different  managing to understand where the money is going. What I see is that his praise for the operational police officers, but also the recognition that some external professional discipline can really get more for less, especially from the huge property  My Honourable Friend makes an important point, but I think this is a point of universal application to everyone of us who has a Police and Crime Commissioner. The essence of localism, which I think in its broadest sense is supported by both major political parties and by the Liberal Party, is that we cannot for ever sake, it is the Minister's fault. We cannot keep on going on saying, the man or woman in Whitehall knows best. Those on the ground who are elected, the elected police and crime commissioners, have to explain what they are doing in their force, with their chief constable, to get more police visibility, with, yes, manifestly constrained resources. And if they are not able to hit their objectives, they have to  It may be that some people think we are doing ourselves out of a job in this chamber, that we just vote the money and tell people to get on with it. Well, that would be a crude gloss on what  but I think the thrust of that point is absolutely correct. We need local people, whether that be on Humberside, Suffolk, Dorset, the West Midlands, wherever it may  to stand up and be counted, to tell people how many hours have been saved in cutting red tape -  more red tape can be  Assets under-employed, estate badly managed, getting more value from those assets. I am going to  Mr Deputy Speaker, by saying that we are facing reductions throughout the Comprehensive Spending Review during the course of this  but we are coming off,  a high base. It is worth saying again, a 20% real-terms increase in the 10 years of the Labour government, up to 2008. And  cuts should be seen against that backdrop. And cuts that we also know that we do not support because we want to be beastly to public services or because we think, you know what,  they need to get more  let's give them less  We would all like to be in a position where the economy has started growing again, to be able to look again at what we spend on  But in the meantime, we have to press on with reform. In  we have had more resources over the last 20 years, but we have not had the reform that should have gone hand in hand with it. Under the current Home Secretary, that area of policy will not be  and she knows that it is not just more money that will reduce crime, it is how you use your police to reduce crime levels and keep our constituents safe. I have got five members trying to catch my eye, so can I ask members to show time we straight in their speeches? At the same time, I may well introduce a time limit to protect backbenchers. Mr Keith .. It is a real pleasure to follow the Honourable Gentleman for Bury St Edmunds. He speaks with enormous knowledge about policing  and is someone who has attended many debates on the police  both in opposition and supporting the government. He has always come to the chamber with good and fresh ideas, and it is a mystery to me why he is not actually in the Home Office doing  because he simply knows about it so much. I have to say, I was a little disappointed with the minister's opening remarks. I like the minister, he has appeared before the Home Affairs Select  he is always very robust, but in a debate of this kind, I think there is no need for knockabout stuff, because we are dealing with very, very serious  I am still a bit puzzled as to why the policing Minister is not  opening this debate today. He may have other important business, but I would have thought that he would have been able to open a debate of this kind, as he has done in the past. Nevertheless, obviously a deal has been done on the front bench, and we are happy to hear the Government's position. I was also present at the funeral of Paul McKeever, and I, like others who have spoken today, want to place on record my appreciation for a life that was dedicated to public service - he was the policeman's policemen. Judging by the hundreds of people who turned up at Southwark Cathedral -- policeman -- including, of course, the Home Secretary, who read the  the Shadow Home Secretary, the policing Minister, the Shadow policing Minister, and the entire hierarchy of the police service, because he was very special. I think it is right that we should start our debates by paying tribute to the work of the police force in  I am going to confine my remarks to a discussion of the new landscape of policing. I will address the issue of how the reduction of the police grant will affect some very important institutions. I am a great fan of what the Home Secretary is doing, as far as reforming the landscape  I am not attached to particular organisations, I am attached to the services that are provided for local people. But I am  as we come half way through the changes that the landscape of  I am not absolutely convinced that at the end of the  we will meet the Home Secretary's objective, from 2010, which was to declutter the policing  I think at the end of  we may well end up with more organisations, rather than  Meyer the concern, Mr Deputy  is, what is happening to all of this money? -- my other  Of course, there is no immediate transfer from one organisation to the other, but - and the select committee has been studying this matter for the last two years - we have been looking at the organisations which have been abolished or are being reformed and the new organisations which are being created, and am afraid, the sums do not add up. I recall the evidence given by the previous policing Minister, the Member for  when I asked him what the new budget of the National Crime Agency was going to be, and he had the director of finance next to him of the Home Office, and he was not aware of what that budget was going  We know that the new National Crime Agency is going to have a budget of around about �400  Yesterday, Alex Marshall, in his assured it evidence to the Select Committee, said that he was going to have a budget of �50  with staff of 600. So, I am not really good at maths - I will not tell you my grade at GCSE, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I'm sure you did better than I did. I think we are about �315 million short. This is not just a few bob here and  this is a lot of money. And if we talk about the context of the overall reduction in the police grant over a number of years, then this kind of money is serious money.  at the end of the day, and I am not trying to put the Minister for national Security on the spot, it would be great to have those sums confirmed either today or in writing to myself or the Select  because I think we really need to look at these  Would he agree with me that one of the down sides of all of these budget cuts, particularly in constituencies like Dorset, the temptation is to bring all of the officers in from the rural areas and close local police stations? That is why I feel there is a loss of confidence not in what the police are doing, but in their ability to do it, because there is no-one out there.The Honourable Gentleman is absolutely right. Because of his profession, he knows about these issues. I am sure he is an assiduous member of this House, and works on behalf of his constituents very considerately -- very assiduously. One of the first concerns of local people is, can I see my local police officer walking  the bobby on the beat? But  can I go to the local police station and be able to report crimes and feel safe as a result of that? It is important that we allow that visibility, both with a physical building, and also of the By one to last about counter- terrorism because I know the government is ring-fencing the  which is something I very much support. However, as we look at the new landscape of policing, there needs to be a decision pretty soon as to whether it is going to stay with the Metropolitan Police or it is going to move to the National crime agency. I have to tell you my personal view, and I think my distinguished colleague from the Select Committee will correct me if I am wrong, but the select committee and one of the report recommended that it went to the National Crime Agency. This is a national issue, and we said this because in creating the committee will ride it might not have enough  and at the moment it doesn't have much to de -- it might not have much to do. It doesn't have that many staff and it is not yet built to the satisfaction of the Select Committee and the government, but we need to have a decision on  very quickly. We were promised a decision after the  and I don't know if the minister will jump up and tell us, but I'm happy to wait until he winds up in order to know the  I am also concerned at the huge amount of money that is currently being spent on historical investigations. This is something we put to witnesses on the Select Committee on many occasions. We have at the moment Operation Alice and various others. We heard only yesterday from the Home Secretary that one operation, which has been operating for the last year, at a cost to the taxpayer of �1.2  with a number of police officers involved, is now going to be taken over by the Chief Constable of Derbyshire. Because it deals with important issues of undercover agents and the serious issues that came out of the public  this is an awful lot  I have worked out that 8 million is currently being spent on the police investigating other police officers who have failed to come up to scratch. Then we have all the money going to the IPCC which is to deal with issues like Hillsborough, which relates to past errors by certain police  And when we look at it the reduction of a grant to local police and crime commissioners, we need to consider all the money currently being spent on all these  I want to end with just  Firstly, on procurement. The Honourable Member for Bury St  he was a spokesman could procurement in the House, and I have had many discussions with him  I welcome what the deputy mayor for London has said, when he has decided to look very carefully at how the Metropolitan Police have spent their budget as far as procurement is concerned. I think it is important that when we choose companies and commission  if the public sector  that we only choose companies to have a good track  Only yesterday it was announced that G4S was going to have to hand back to the taxpayer around �70 million. If you look at the expenditure for the police budget on companies like G4S, the select committee was clear that as a result of the big mistakes made by G4S that they should hand back all of their management fee of �57  plus all the other money they ought to have spent. My Honourable Friend for Walsall North became an internet hit with his soundbite of a humiliating shambles. These are the words we may always remember him for. The fact is, it  When you are dealing with public money and the issue of procurement, as the Honourable Member for Bury St Edmunds said, you need to be very careful in dispensing public money on private companies and put them up not coming up to scratch. My very final  which will give others the opportunity of coming in without having a time limit, is the whole issue of carrying people with you. By his very nature, the Minister for security is an avuncular, consensus led person. We will see this when he comes to the dispatch  I would like to say the most courteous of the Home Office  because the others might  but he does not pick  Actually, at the moment, Home Office policy is picking a fight with the very people who have to implement the changes. I really don't think this is the best time to be cutting the pensions of our police officers, forcing them out and cutting their pay retrospectively. It is for new  I perfectly understand why we need to look at changes, and I can remember my last conversation with Paul McKee there on this very  -- Paul McKee there. He passionately supported treating police officers with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve. My only real row with the former prime minister was over the issue of police pay, when he was quite robust and asked me not to go on a demonstration under the last Labour government in support of the police who were having their pay cut. I said to him them, and I say to the ministers now, and to the Home Secretary who will I am sure read my speech avidly when she gets Hansard tomorrow, you have to carry the workforce with you. If we say we have the best police force in  the only way to respect and admire what they have done is to Prix -- treat them with proper  Have a dialogue with them, stop cutting their pay and  it to speak to them, because they know best.

If we don't, the brand name we have will be damaged forever.There are four  and if everybody does less than 15 minutes, everybody will get equal time and I won't impose the clock. Thank you very  Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a great pleasure to follow the chair of the Home Affairs Select  I agreed that the vast majority of what he says, as is so often the case. I'd like to start off by paying tribute to Paul McKee  He was an impressive man, and it was a great pleasure to work with him and have that sense of energy and commitment to the cause. He was a great man and it was a huge shock when I heard that he had passed away. I look forward to working with Steve Williams, his replacement, and I hope he will bring the same sort of energy and continue to articulate the important case for police officers for a very long time to come. I'd also like to pay tribute to all the other police officers we have who do such a great job. In terms of the debate we have today about the  we have a report which is very detailed, and an interesting thing to look at if you want to see how complex government formalist  There are some high per accurate figures which might not bear much relations to reality, but that is how it works. The key is about the total sum of money and how it is allocated. That was outlined very well by Mike Honourable friend when he started. This is what was agreed in 2010, and I am very pleased, as he is, that the other cuts that have had to happen have not been passed on to the police. That is something I very much welcome. Would we like to spend more money on policing?  Like so many areas of the public sector, it would be great if there was more money to spend on everything. It is a very, very easy thing to say. Would I like more money in Cambridgeshire?  We had some quotes earlier about the chief constable saying they would like to have more  What a shock. I would be concerned about any chief constable's future who said they could not think of any way to spend  We would all like to see more money but we are in straitened  We knew there was no money left when the government took office and be no but of every �4  �5 was being borrowed. The Honourable Member argued in favour of 12% of cuts as opposed to  I think it is worth highlighting the these are figures that relate to the amount of money coming from government to the  not taking account of the generated locally money, so the effects are slightly smaller. What he didn't do was to answer my repeated question about where he would get the money from. If I had an extra spare �1 billion, I would love to spend it on a whole range  We could have a fascinating debate on how to spend  but simply saying you would spend it without same way you would take it from is a cheaper think that should not be done in  When I was leader of the opposition in Cambridgeshire County Council, one of the things I insisted on was that as an opposition we put together a costed Budget and take it through the same scrutiny process that the administration did. We have done that incredibly well this year. I think it would be fantastic for oppositions in this place to provide a fully costed proposals and put them through the same  so they are not just coming up with fanciful sums. So I was disappointed not to hear that  There is an issue about  It is fantastic that crime is down and we should all celebrate that fact, that it is down almost everywhere in the  And it is an easy thing to sound the alarm and say that in the future that it might go up, and it  But if you don't put a timescale on how long it is you think it will be, you can keep saying that forever. You can keep worrying people forever that things might get bad. If you want to make a genuine prediction, please have some sense of when you would accept that it turns out we have not seem -- seen crime going up. Times are  and when times are tied we have to prioritise spending on policies which actually do serve to reduce crime and achieve the goals of the police. That is the key  How do you spend the money that you do have? There was a list of things the Honourable Member was concerned about, which I'm very pleased we are cutting money on. I'm pleased money is being saved by not having CCTV cameras across the entire country with so little  I am delighted we are spending money on having a commissioner on surveillance cameras he will make sure CCTV will be used where it is useful and genuinely proportionate. That is something I'm extremely pleased  I'm pleased to see we are cutting the money spent storing the DNA of innocent people, people who had never even been accused of any crime at all. That is a cut I am very pleased to see. I am very pleased to see we are saving money on internal exile without trial and saving money on identity cards. I wish we had saved more money on identity cards and it hadn't all  With some other areas, I am very concerned about the increasing rate of teasers been issued a very widely. I am in favour of trees are guns -- teaser. If we believe him policing by  having less fire alarms is something that stops escalation -- less fire arms. The I also turn to the issue of communications data. This government also had a draft proposals to spend �1.8 billion and they have spent 400 million already, and a huge sum was spent under the previous governments in its attempt to have the intercept modernisation  That is billions of pounds that could have been spent  No party he would just spend money willy-nilly without looking at how it is being spent and what the benefits might be. In order to have better prioritised spending we could do a lot about  I think we need to be very careful that the move to police and crime Commission has does not reduce the Count -- transparency we need to see. I am very pleased to see the College of policing being established. We have a policy to go further and have an institute for policing excellence, to try to find out what are the best things one can do, linked with universities. I hope we will see a strong link between the college of policing and universities to find out what is happening. There are  like Larry show would,  who is a world expert on how to do policing effectively and efficiently to achieve the goals you want. That means you can find or how time is spent and make sure it is used effectively and efficiently. I'm in favour of visible policing. Visible policing is not measured by police officers  it is affected by how much time those police officers can spend out on the street, rather than having to do all the bureaucratic work which they did when I went to visit them over the last few years. They spend far too much time struggling with IT  paperwork, where we would like and to be out on the streets I still believe that our drugs policy does not make the best use of police time. It sucks up vast amounts of police time for very little benefit. We have some of the highest incidence of drug use in this country. There are alternatives, like the Portuguese  I was speaking to the chief superintendent in Brighton, at the launch of the Breaking the Taboo  which I recommend members have a look at. He was doing some extremely good work in Brighton, reducing crime by having a far more enlightened, semi Portuguese  I recommend that. There is also a lot to say about the role of the police, not just in detecting crime, but in stepping in  I have spoken in this place about a police officer who was in my constituency when I was a county councillor, who had a very, very effective approach, which he  about using e-mail far more widely to chat to people, to tell them where he was. So, they got the visible policing by this e-  saying where he had been out what he had been up to. But he also focused on young people, who were bought during the holidays, setting up a brilliant scheme giving vouchers during the holidays to children who were seen playing well. Whichever class got the most vouchers got a �15 voucher in the local shops. The effect in this area was that kids were playing in  hoping a police officer would see them. It made for a better relationship between young people and the police, and it reduced the amount of crime. In his first year on that beach, he reduced the amount of crime and anti-social behaviour by 15%. He did not detect very much, he did not arrest many people, but he halved the crime rate. That is the sort of thing we want to see. There can be far more done about information-sharing with other agencies as well. Information can be shared with hospitals, more public as this can be provided to local crime statistics. -- more public access. Information can be shared with universities, and on a broader scale as well. I am concerned by some of the proposals we have seen from the Home  for example, to opt out of some of the co-operation arrangements with the European  We know that the Association of Chief police officers, who I do not always agree with, but they have said that to opt out of that would lead to fewer extraditions, longer delays, higher costs, more offenders evading justice and an increased risk to public safety. If we're going to have good policing, policing by consent, it is not always just about the total amount of money spent. For example, stop and search was a huge issue under  From 2008, an officer in the West Midlands was 28 times more likely to stop a black person than a white person. We have similar figures in the Met and in great  That was a big project, a bad project, it put a lot of  it created a lot of  and it was expensive. Stop-and-search under terrorism legislation fell by 90% in the last couple of years, under changes made by this government, saving money and improving relationships. We do not want to do things which cost the police time and money and turn young people against the police. One key measure is that crime is  and we hope that we'll continue for many years to come. I hope the money will be spent effectively. There was some discussion earlier about the Liberal Democrat manifesto. I am delighted that so many members have  I wish more members adopted more of it. The section on crime started off with one simple aim - we will focus on what works to cut crime. That's what we said  and that is what we will do  Mr Deputy Speaker. I am hoping to keep my remarks reasonably brief. I would like to pay tribute to pull McKeever, who tragically passed away. He was an articulate, intelligent and passionate speaker, and his loss will be great. Can I just touch upon the issue of the National Crime Agency in the first instance? I think my Right Honourable Friend is quite right to highlight the concern that he has over the budgeting that is going to follow this change in the landscape, as he described it. Because, in the discussions in committee, it seemed to me quite clear that there was nigh-on a halving of the total funding which was going to follow- through to the National Crime Agency to discharge its functions, compared with the various commands which preexisted it. So, I think it is something that needs to have a further attention, and I'm sure it will not escape his notice. I very much welcome the tone of the debate in recent exchanges - it has been very well presented, and it is a marked difference from some of the opening remarks. I would not want anybody to think that I myself, as a new member from Middlesbrough, or anybody else from this side of the  would have anything other than the greatest respect and admiration for our police force. We would not want to do anything other than see their rates of crime reduced and celebrate that. It has been established in the course of this debate that that has been the trend since the days of John Major's government. But we do stand by our record, that we were the only government in modern history of to have left government with lower rates of crime than when we  So, perhaps we can nail that issue and celebrate the reduction in crime, but we must be for ever on our guard. It would be remiss of me not to welcome and thank the Minister for his reassurance given in committee about the preservation of the regional organised crime units. It was a concern of mine that the intelligence and the successful operation of those units might well be lost in the changing landscape. He has given us that reassurance. I am very much aware of the success of my own region organised crime unit in bringing to account a very significant Class A drugs crime ring in recent times. We on this side of the House have warmed the Government for some time -- warned -- that these budget cuts will have a major impact on policing. To say otherwise would be unrealistic. The reality in Cleveland is that the number of officers lost between 2010 and 2012 was some 234, reducing the total number of police officers from 1724 to 1490. According to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, that translates to some 15,000 police officers nationally, which will result in the lowest number of police officers for more than a  As at September 2011, 500 officers had already gone. All of that necessarily impact upon the ability officers to respond to emergency calls, and will result in less visibility of police officers in our communities and on our  I did take on board the comments of the Honourable Member from Cambridge, when he said it was not simply about numbers, but I respectfully suggest that if you reduce the critical mass of police  it will bite into your effectiveness, it is a fairly self- evident statement. May I also suggest that the people of this country did not really ever expect politicians to go about their business by reducing the numbers of police officers? I think that's self-evident from the references made to manifestos at the last  which were couched in completely opposite terms. I am aware that the Government will plead that crime is down, and that the reduction in the workforce is therefore manageable, but that does not do anything to address the fact that fewer crimes are being solved. 000 fewer crimes being brought to justice, including 7,000 offences of violence against the  I would suggest, Mr Deputy  this is the wrong moment to be lax and take our foot off the  There may well be pressures building in our society which we may regret a scaling back of our state of readiness.

The Cleveland Commissioner advises that we know we're facing a potential funding gap of more than �5 million by  He says, finding further savings will be a tough challenge. If we are to take the ground for the next two years, it will mean that for 2015-16 onwards, there will be a further short fall of over half a million pounds. That's the equivalent of 11 officers, or 18 community support workers. We know that total government funding in terms of these revenues reduced 7 �4 billion in 2010-11, to less than �9 million two years  a reduction of nearly �1.1  That was an equivalent to 000 police of his posts. -- �9  In Cleveland, the resulting impact of that will be some �24 million worth of savings having to be made.

Mention was made of where the funding comes  and it is not all from a single source, but it is interesting to get a perspective on that sort of funding, because we're talking about an increase in the precept of up to 95% to make up  So, in conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would urge the Government to think about this. There must be a real risk that the coming cuts will lead to problems in the months and years ahead, which may extend to challenge our frontline police officers too far. I urge the Government to be visit the proposal from this side of the House to limit the extent of the cuts to the budget to 12%, which Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabularies thought workable, without damaging front line  The before I start my contribution to this very important  I want to pay tribute to one police constable, Fiona Bone -- to a woman police constable Fiona  and woman police constable Nicola Hughes. They went to a routine court at short notice, and were both shot. It is a perfect example of what the Right Honourable Gentleman for Leicester East said about the fact that police officers, unlike perhaps any other professionals, just do not know what they're going to face when they leave home. As such, we owe a great deal of duty and responsibility towards them, and to make sure that their best interests are looked after. Mr Deputy Speaker, the minister in his opening remarks said that crime is falling, and of  we agree with that, it is  at this moment in time. But if I understood correctly, he is trying to take some of the credit for that. There have to say to him that crime began to fall just before 1997, when the Labour government came in. And when we  the morale of the police force was at an all-time low. It was the Labour policies of increasing frontline police  the introduction of thousands of bobbies on the beat, the police and community support  the neighbourhood police  the record investment in rehabilitation centres for people who were addicted to drugs and  the fact that we also funded rehabilitation services and increased the number of rehabilitation centres, our policies of diverting young people away from the criminal justice system - all of these things collectively continued to lead the fall in crime. That's even though, whilst crime was falling, none of the opposition politicians at the time - Liberal Democrat or Conservatives - ever came on the  radio or in the print  too acknowledge that crime was going down. In fact, every time they appeared on the radio and  when the Labour Party was in power, they would always argue that crime was rising. But  they are actually recognising the true state of what was Figures have shown that the 20% cut is not working. There has been an increase of 7 billion of higher deficit in the last month than the previous financial year. Clearly what this has shown is the austerity measures, generally, which has even been criticised by a very conservative Institute, the  is clearly not working. Let me help the ministry in this matter. One should make cuts if, in the  you will actually reduce and save money. To use a modern  smart cards. What often prevents people from committing crime is the sight of a police officer -- smart cuts. And a reassurance is also a site of a police officer. I'm sure many members when they have not on the doors of their constituents have heard that those constituents want to see more visible police officers and feel reassured when they do so. The government cut has led to a number of police officers being cut. Let me take the example of the north-west region. In March of 2010, the numbers of police were 19,649. In September of 2012, 17,708.  there had been a reduction of 1986 police officers.  these cuts will carry on for the next year, so by 2015 there will be 2951 less police officers.  no one will be able to convince me that will not have an impact on policing and an impact on  I thank the Honourable Lady for giving way. Let's say next year we still have crime coming down, and the next year we still had it  at which point does she accept that crime is continuing to come down and will keep going for a while? Let's see what happens in the next few years, because there are so many or austerity measures going on and the cuts are only just starting to hit. In the next few years they will really hit  and everybody knows that in times of economic difficulty, eventually certain levels of crime it will rise. Small crimes like breaking into vehicles, small items, changing quick money. This is one aspect that perhaps has not been touched upon, that although crime  the fact is fewer crimes are being resolved, and there have been at least 2296 violent offences against people in the north-west which have been  and that is in comparison to the previous figures when they were able to actually resolve much more high-level figures, and once the full impact of the cuts are  I do feel that there will be a rise in the coming years. The minister also boasted that recruitment is not a problem and we are doing everything we can to encourage and create a better police force. But that is not the impression I get from police officers out on the front line. Let me talk about police constable Turnbull who came to see me in my constituency office. He said he joined the police force many years ago and came in for Pope and had a very high level of dedication to his duty -- he came in full of hope. He said that morale in the police officer -- officers, especially the younger officers, is at an all-time  They are unhappy the cuts are  and they talked about the police pension, and I know the Right Honourable Member or has referred to the issue of pensions. While we acknowledge the recruits are coming in, and they will know the terms and conditions on which they are being recruited, they may make their decision on whether to join the force or not. But to retrospectively take away people's pension rights, when they have  15, 20 years towards it, is plainly unfair, and is not going to help the morale of the police. Let's face it, people are as good as how demoralised or moralise they  If they are happy, they performed better -- perform better, if they are unhappy, their performance may be affected. I hope  because we have an incredibly good police force, one of the best  and I think sometimes we don't pay enough credits to the police force and all the good work they carry on. I just want to conclude my remarks about some of the quotes from the Chief  especially the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, who said the financial year 2013 would be the most difficult financing year for police in living  Things will only get worse,  So imagine what it will be like the year after that. And  and I know this has been quoted before, but I think it's worth reminding the ministers, that Steve Finnigan, the Chief Constable of Lancashire Constabulary, said, and he is the lead on police performance management, was asked if he would reduce front line policing in order to meet the government budget cuts. He replied, I absolutely am. He also said, let me be clear, would the scale of cuts we are experiencing -- with the scale of cuts we are experiencing, we can do a lot around the back office the we cannot leave the front line  Therefore I would finally asked the ministers to consider this. We have said Labour's proportionate cut plan of 12% over the parliamentary period is a proportionate response to deal with the issue of deficit. And this is confirmed by her Majesty's inspectors of Constabulary who said  as well as the work by previous governments, has delivered and will deliver a frontline services without a great deal of  Therefore, as with my previous Honourable Friend, I would ask the government to reconsider their course of action they are proposing and consider the Labour It has been a very interesting afternoon and an interesting debate,  I share the view of my Honourable Friend for Middlesbrough that the contribution to the debates have improved once we got beyond the opening contribution from the minister, who describes himself as the very model of a very modest minister. It was rather more affordable than serious political contribution to what is a very serious political issue -- border  About how safe and secured people feel about -- around the streets and in their homes and across all areas of the country. This is a serious issue which deserves a serious debate. To be fair to all Honourable Members on both sides of the House that have contributed to the debate  I think the seriousness of the debate has been recognised and there have been really excellent contributions. Crime rates are down, and that is something to be applauded. As people have indicated, they have been going down for many years. Right from the end of the Major government and through the lifetime of the Labour government and into the current coalition government. That is credit to all of those governments, and credit to the actions of politicians, but more importantly, most importantly, credit to the actions of the police and those partnerships that they work in together with other people to ensure that their work is to make people more Secure. Not only what is pleasing as my Honourable Friend for Bolton said, not only a crime rates coming down, but also people's sense of being safe and Secure going up. So the fear of crime is falling. That is certainly the case in my own area, in the villages and towns of the Scunthorpe constituency. That does not mean that people don't have  They do still suffer  sadly, and that wrecks and ruins and badly affect people's  The reality is, the overall effect is coming down, and that is to be applauded and welcomed. Since becoming a member of parliament for Scunthorpe county, I have been privileged to spend a lot of time of the local police, going out with the traffic police, seeing the work that is going on in working on the relationship between drugs and alcohol and anti-social behaviour,  crime, and taking actions between the police and  and the local authority, working together to target and reduce crime across the patch. Also seen the work of the integrated offender management system, led by  but supported strongly by police and other partners wear high offenders are targeted to reduce their behaviour and their impact and the community -- on the  and the level of crime  I also spent time in Scunthorpe town centre on a Saturday night seeing how do night- time economy is effectively policed involving partnerships between the  the door personnel across a  and also the street pastas to do a fantastic job within that  Finally, I spend time going out with a false beard that aiming to reduce -- with a force that is aimed at reducing young people committing crime, and with particular respect to the team working with the magistrate locally, to see the way that has effectively impacted on the behaviours of young people involved in crime, to reduce that and move them away from criminal behaviour. Indeed, that work has been recognised nationally for the quality of it. So with all these examples that idea of where I have been privileged to be alongside the local police, it is important to recognise that none of these cases see the police acting  They are acting in  They are acting with  And it is effectively through that partnership work, which has been built up over time, which has significantly impacted on the level on crime and the level of my fear of crime, across the piece. As members have pointed out in this  it is not only police budgets under pressure, but we are going on to a debate after this one which looks at local authority budgets under pressure. We also know that health budgets are under  Social housing budgets are under pressure. The cumulative effects of the budgets under pressure is to put at risk the partnership working that has built these great strides forward in terms of policing in our country.  to say that is not a risk is  I hope, in my local area, and across other parts of the  that the imagination, the  the commitment of everybody working together will find a way of maintaining the good quality partnership working, rather than imperilling it, which can be the temptation when people start to I have been very impressed by the way my local chief superintendent has led his team. He said to me in the last meeting I had with him that they had now basically made cuts of 12% across the police force  And he says, that 12% has been a challenge, it has been  but it has been doable, and it has been done without impacting directly on to frontline policing. I then asked him the question, what would happen with these further cuts coming down the line? He looked a little quizzical. But when the answer comes back, he says, essentially, it cannot be guaranteed that frontline services will not be impacted on with fur  -- with further budget  It is interesting, the 12% cuts which have been done so far are in line with what Labour said they would have done, and also in line with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's identification of something which  without impacting upon the front line. So, that's the point at which we have come to. The point that we are going to, and the reason why this debate need to look  rather than backwards, is that what we are debating here is further cuts on top of that. And for those further cuts, there really is the risk of making a really negative impact on policing and the safety of those neighbourhoods and communities that we represent. Already, in  227 fewer police are in  and there will be fewer still win these cuts are followed  So, what's being looked at  the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats coming together to be voting in favour of further cuts to police budgets, cutting �2 billion over the period of the Spending Review. That will effectively mean that 15,000 officers are Cup. It will mean real  running ahead of this estimate already. These are significant reductions in police  We already see fewer crimes being solved. The detection rate is down, with 30,000 fewer crimes brought to justice, including 7,000 offences of violence against the person. It is interesting that that is an area  certainly locally, violent crimes are unfortunately on a slightly upward trend. These crime trends are complicated, and it is a mixed picture. Although the general trend is down, there are spikes in neighbourhoods and in particular types of criminal activity. And it is not just members of the public and Labour politicians that are expressing concern. The Conservative police and crime commissioners, as we have already  have spoken publicly about the necessity to raise their precepts to stop government cuts from harming their area. Many admit that despite precept rises, further officer reductions are likely. In the words of the Essex Conservative  he says, ultimately, there must be a risk that continued cuts in the number of police officers will make Essex more vulnerable to  So, these are the words of the people who have just picked up  They have looked at the  looked at the issues, and this is what they are saying. So, the danger is that these cuts will mean fewer frontline officers, fewer officers responding to 999 calls and the police being less visible and available under this government. As the Shadow minister said, police visibility and a viola pity is very  -- and availability. It is essential to the Health and well-being of individuals and communities across the piece. So,  strangely, are worse already than Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary had  It is a part of this government's ill-thought out reforms to policing, which is making it harder to become a police  and less rewarding. That is a real worry, because we all recognise the great work that these police officers do on our behalf. As my Right Honourable Friend  we need to have these people with us, we need to support these people, so they can continue to do a great job for us in the  We have had an interesting debate today, and I will just run through some of the contributions. The Member for Bury St Edmunds made a very fair speech, speaking about the need for more effective procurement, and also noted Labour's investment in policing. The chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee spoke thoughtfully as ever about a number of issues, raising the key issue of funding for the new National Crime Agency and the important issue of police visibility. The Member for Cambridge said he wanted less CCTV, more transparency, and that he hoped that crime and police commissioners would not hinder that. The Member for Middlesbrough said that he had the greatest respect and admiration for the police force, as we all should. He also noted the downward trend in crime and hoped it would continue, as we all do, although there is no room for  The Member for Bolton South-East rightly paid tribute to PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone. She also made a passionate defence of Labour's record on crime when in  The Member for Scunthorpe also welcomed the long-term downward trend in crime. Obviously, he speaks with some authority on these matters, given how much time he has been out and about with his local force in Scunthorpe. We are all constituency MPs in this House, and we all hear from the people that we represent, that local people want to see local police on their local streets. So, it is no wonder that at the last general  David Cameron, the Prime  promised to protect frontline police officers. Less than two years ago, he told this  there is no reason for there to be fewer frontline police  And the Home Secretary said in October 2010 - what I am  we know that it is possible for the police to make significant reductions in their budgets without affecting frontline  We have heard countless times from the party opposite -- parties opposite, I should say - that frontline services will be protected in spite of budget cuts  You cannot cut budgets by 20% and expect that to be found in administration. It is a fantasy that the government has that police stations are packed full of pen-  If you cut costs, you have to cut staff, and those staff are the police officers the public rely on to keep them safe. I was bemused when I was doing some preparation for this speech to find a report, a response to a Freedom of Information request, asking, what is the definition of frontline policing? The Department responded,  it could not define the term front line, saying, there is no formally agreed definition. So,  never mind the fact that they cannot deliver on the policy,  they do not seem to know what it means.Would she also agree that for those people who do not work on the front line, they do actually do a vital job, and the front line would not be able to operate without them? The way this government talks about them, as if they can be discarded without any regard whatsoever... I totally agree with those comments. The line that seems to be from the government benches that it does not matter how many police officers  and, as some members  it is a far cry from the general election campaign, when Liberal Democrats were promising to 000 extra police officers. I know that we might be getting a little bit immune to the Liberal Democrats breaking election  but this one, like so  and I am interested to see the Focus leaflet in Eastleigh,  it was not worth the ink on the leaflet it was printed  In Eastleigh, I am sure they will be explaining why, in  there will be 295 fewer police officers on their streets. We have heard lots of voices from members today, but it is also worth reflecting on those views of the people who have been sent here to  Some polling has been done for ITV news, which shows why there can be no room for  which I feel we are seeing on the government side of  In that poll, 38% thought crime have got worse in their area in the last three months. Just 6% thought it had got better. 22% Thought anti-social behaviour had got worse in the last three  Just 8% thought things had  When you have got more than one in five believing anti- social behaviour, and more than one in three for crime in general, having got worse in their neighbourhood, and actually, we should all be concerned. If I can quote the words... I think it is  if the public expressed their concerns, if they believe that crime and anti-social behaviour are rising, I think we have a duty to reflect that. Last  I spoke to a senior police  and he told me that the thing the public tell all of us that they value most, the bobby on the beat being part of the  he told me, it is becoming harder and harder to  If I can quote from him  he said - we were forced to up our game. Things like the requirement to spend at least 80% of time on the beat. I have still not been given an answer as to why that pledge was scrapped. He talked about that pledge also requiring the neighbourhood police team to respond to non-urgent messages within 24 hours, and he said to me, when we did that, our satisfaction rates went through the roof. He continued - customer focus has now  He said - our first job is to keep people safe. The 999 stuff is still OK, he said. The neighbourhood stuff, the fact that the community knows us, who the local bobby is, that has gone. You deal with demand, you would draw to your statutory responsibilities. But issues like anti-social  why you need to build trust and confidence, you need people to know you, so people tell  and you can nip things  That it has gone, he  At the moment we are just ending up with bigger and bigger control rooms, which is storing up problems for the future, he said. Like many in this House who will receive complaints, horrific tales from their constituents, I got one last week from a constituent, had told me - we have suffered with anti-social behaviour a -- about the property we live in. We understand that staffing levels are  and they have to have  but by the time the police arrived, all the offenders had left the area, so no action was  The constituent went on - we now feel totally alone in dealing with this situation, and we think it is totally unacceptable. Police 000 fewer crimes last  as the number of officers were slashed. Detection rates fell for the first time in more than a  Fewer crimes are being  fewer criminals are being  and fewer victims are getting justice. Mr Deputy Speaker, the police are needed to provide a  visible presence in our neighbourhoods. I'm sure all members of the House, unless anybody can tell me different - has anyone been approached by a constituent and heard the word  thank you for cutting the number of police officers? No.  the Member for Taunton said he has been congratulated on cutting... As she mentions it, I have had a number of people coming up to me over the last couple of years,  thank God we have got a government which is willing to get to grips with the appalling deficit left behind by the previous Labour This is a debate about  but I will say this - borrowing is up. So, the question  Mr Speaker, is, do we want to vote for budget proposals from the parties opposite, guaranteeing the lowest number of police officers in a decade, or do we want to listen to the public and the police and call on the Government to change course and rethink next year's police budget cuts and stop letting communities down? Thank you  and can I thank all honourable and Right Honourable Members for participating in what has been a lively debate on the police funding settlement? I recognise a number of the points that have been made about reductions in funding, but we are confident that they are manageable. The police are making the necessary  and have transformed the way they deliver the service to the  and this has been achieved along with reductions in overall  And it is right to say that we inherited the toughest fiscal challenge in living memory, and are having to take tough decisions.

I think he would  and I would agree, that we have the best police force in the  I pay tribute to the work that they do, day-in, day-out, to keep us all safe. I also pay tribute to the work of our chief constables and senior officers in achieving savings, driving efficiencies and cutting crime. HMIC has challenged forces to drive through efficiencies and has shown that around half of the savings made can be achieved by forces just raising the performance to the average of their immediate Peers. There are the areas where the police can make savings without affecting the level of service to the public, for instance by adopting a national approach to the buying of equipment. It was a point that my honourable friend made about how if this disease can be made through those routes. Office's work in back of this Rolls and they have decreased -- office says working in back of this rolls have HMIC has stated that forces have plans to deliver 87% of the required savings by 20th March 15, indicating that police forces are working well in terms of the savings to be made. -- by March,  Further, there are suggesting that despite crime going down, satisfaction between people is up.

I welcome the way in which she is conducting this debate from the dispatch box. Canny clarify one point in respect of the Home Secretary's good statement  -- can he.

I think that is precisely does these tells us to the most effective way to deliver on that type of register that is being established. I'm sure that through the scrutiny that the Home Affairs Select Committee the  I'm sure the honourable gentleman and his committee will be following through on those important issues that followed from the well received announcement that the Home Secretary made yesterday. I would comment on a number of points that have been made around the issue of the arrangements for  and obviously the police allocation formula itself. What I would say is that the government will conduct a fundamental review of the police allocation formula, as my honourable friend highlighted in his contribution, and will seek the views of PCCs across England  determining how funding should be allocated in the future. It is a complex and important matter which requires careful consideration and will take time. In that context, I think it is important that that work is undertaken before we can consider the issues of the arrangements for damping in that context. The honourable gentleman highlighted the issue of the budgets around the  What I would say to him is that he focused on the funding for the college of policing. But there is funding around the provision of airwave and also the police icy t  I think he was trying to draw one thing to another. But  there are the elements to  -- other elements. A number of points have been made around pay and conditions. I honourable friend highlighted that pay accounts for the large majority of police  and the police pay bill is a huge issue. We asked the police and the public sector to take a two-year pay freeze, and subject to any decisions on staff  we expect the policy for public sector pay restraint and also apply to the police. It is also where we have taken forward proposals for the Windsor review. We can save around �150 million by We can save around �150 million by implementing this. The opposition front bench would only be looking for 12% savings. That is what has  I think what is also interesting in that is that  they also support reforms to over time and shift  They also support the pay freeze and the police arbitration panel decision on police pay. Therefore it is 12%, plus those  When you analyse that, they are substantially in the same position as the government. It was interesting that the opposition did not seem to accept that. If they are saying it is 12%, which of those elements don't they accept? That is a question they will need to consider carefully. It is interesting that they have not responded on that particular point. The honourable gentleman asks me about the National crime Agency and the counter-terrorism elements, and whether that should be part of the end see a moving forward. It is a point that he and his committee  What I can say to him is that there will be no wholesale review of policing arrangements in England and Wales until after the NCA is up and running.

I'm sure that is something the police and crime commissioners will be focused upon within their communities. But yes, there's still more to do. But we're confident that with a clear focus on making the necessary changes, the police continue to provide the service the public deserve alongside delivering public value  I pay tribute to the work of the police in doing that. I pay tribute to their success in cutting crime and keeping our communities safe and I commend this motion to the House.The question is as on the order paper.

This settlement is also fair to all councils, even those that Labour left with a massive financial cliff edge, like  Thanks to the new efficiency Support Grant, does seven authorities facing the biggest hit to budgets will be protected. I'm grateful to him for giving way. Can he explain to the House why this Government took �573 million out of the relative needs block of the settlement to distribute it on a per capita basis?

It says that excluding London, northern regions have the largest spending power per dwelling. More deprived areas generally receive higher per dwelling allocations.

We do need, in the period up to 2020, to move towards a more just settlement. He makes a point as passionately as he did on Monday. I know he will continue to do that. I will touch on the situation for role funding in a few moments. -- rural funding. Why is it that the baroness eaten, a former Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, said of his department that when it came to cuts on local government, he was detached from the reality that councils are dealing with. Why did she say that? I will touch in a few moments on how we are in touch with local government. The fact is, the previous government was so busy doling out grants that they failed to pay attention to local people and local authorities. By contrast, we are listening, learning and  We have received 200 written responses to our consultation on the provisional  We have talked to with individual authorities, chief executives and treasurers, to local government associations and others, and I spoke to around 200 councillors in a telephone call the day after the proposal settlement. That is why we are going to do more to support rural areas, for example. As well as confirming the increases to the sparsity waiting, we have announced additional funding of 5 million in 2014 so that the sparse populations get some of the  I wonder if he could explain why the city of Nottingham council is increasing tax but cutting its library services while the county council is not putting up council tax but is keeping its libraries open, investing in its highways and improving infrastructure? I think he makes an excellent point. With good leadership, a Conservative council is looking after its residents. Other areas will feel the benefits for rural  This brings me to have said point. Is the Minister confirming to MPs in rural areas that he is open for further discussion about the perceived disparity between funding? I would like to hear from him a clarification that he is up for such discussions. As I said on Monday, I have an open-door policy. I am happy to continue that discussion and I hope that we can have some evidence to back up the figures to prove the case. I note he has been involved in a lot of discussions with various local authority representatives. Will he be willing to reopen discussions with Liverpool City  the most deprived in the  which has suffered the highest level of cuts? How can that be fair? Liverpool has had a reduction of minus 1.3, so it is no worse than anywhere else. I will make progress. As I said, areas will feel the benefit of this Grant. My third point. The fact this system now works in the fable of local councils, and through the Localism Act, reforms in this settlement meaning that 70% of local authority income will be raised locally, councils now have more power than ever before. But they do need to understand - in a moment - they need to understand the implications. They need to work in their residence' best interests'. -- residents' best interests'. Town halls should not be constructing defences against the deficit. The figures of 70%, that is a figure going around. The Prime Minister used it the other day. Isn't the real reason why it has gone up is simply because the amount of money coming from central government and local government has  and therefore the council tax has risen as a percentage? That is the only reason. I think you need to look at the new business rates retention scheme. It gives authorities a chance to be in control of their destiny. It also gives me the chance to highlight that we need to get in control of the deficit that was left by the last government. I am going to make more progress. We need to move away from seeing local authorities like  where the residents may have wondered what the council was digging with their money when it wasted thousands on propaganda posters attacking cuts. Unfortunately, they are not alone. Isn't one way that councils can save money is to reduce the astronomical salaries of some of their staff? Over 114 chiefs now I'm more than the Prime Minister. The chief executive of Hammersmith and Fulham and its �291,000 per  -- earns.

I'm sure some councils may have a case, but if  they should put it to vote. They should stand up for residents and state their case. If they win the argument, so be it. We will take a dim view of democracy dodgers trying to sneak under the democratic radar, especially those  Just think about this. Our grant is equivalent of 1%.

The issue is actually about the erosion of the council tax base and that is having a very real and devastating impact in local authorities on Tameside. I would suggest he does more research. The Secretary of State said first. Council tax money isn't about minding the money of councils, it is hard paying council tax payers  Councils themselves already have more in reserve than they are losing through the cutbacks.  Manchester and Leeds have reserves twice that.

It is where the Tory leader of Kent says his county can't cope with further reductions and is, I quote, running on empty. Local Government is the most efficient part of the public sector. That is what the Prime Minister had to say before the election. They have decided to reward councils for their efficiency by cutting more from On value for money, can he explain why his colleagues decided, with all of these pressures, to take a quarter of a billion pounds of public money in an attempt to try to persuade councils to change the way they collected bins, which resulted in one council changing their schedule?

The changes to Council Tax Benefit are being would -- be made worse. This is what the local government association have  I quote. Funding for local government is projected to fall by 9% in 2013-2014, and a further 4 % in 2014-2015. The grant to local government will fall by 23 -- 33% in real terms over the current spending period. By any measure, you can't call that modest. They then go on to say that modelling work from the Government Association shows a gap of �16.5 billion by 2019-2020 if reductions continue on current trends. It is  it is massive. It is about time that ministers started to recognise the truth of what they  If to dial was not bad  the language they had used about those who are serving local government has been extraordinary and offensive. -- if denial. We saw that last month when Conservative leaders of Derbyshire, Essex, Buckinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Kent and East Sussex and West Sussex voter the Prime Minister to complain about ministers on the front bench over there. They  I quote, patronising  They said the nature and tone of constant criticism of councillors' work by Conservative ministers is most worrying. They talked about ill-informed criticism and sometimes highly inaccurate personal attacks. They concluded by  We believe, these are Tory leaders, we believe it is essential to bring to your attention our concerns regarding some government policy regarding local government. The rhetoric and the effect it is having on our  too. It is no good ministers asking local government to take on an enormous challenge, which they are, if at the same time the people you expect to step up and respond are criticised and patronised and belittled. Perhaps the Minister could explain why allowing councillors to save for a pension apparently has, in his  and I quote, a corrosive influence on independent thought. Disgusting! When you stop to think about that, what is the hope for all of us here? It is an insult, an insult to councillors to say that. I think it shows a fundamental lack of respect for people who are working really hard in difficult circumstances. I could also say the same - of course I will give way. The is he aware that the Select Committee did a report recently about Cerys in the community? --  Younger people lose income because they give up work and have to attend council meetings. To then give up their pension as well so that income suffers later in life, isn't that a disgrace? I agree with my honourable friend completely. What makes it even more inexplicable is that elected mayors will be able to keep their right to save for a pension because that is what the Minister announced. For the life of me, perhaps he can explain what is the difference between an elected mayor in terms of time and commitment and the leader of Birmingham, and the leader of Manchester, and the leader of Leeds City Council? They are also full time, dedicated and committed to their jobs. I could also say the same about the fact that publishing the provisional settlement on 19th December was elated it has been. That has caused problems for councils. Councillor I have spoken to speak of errors in double counting, which the Minister did not mention. Perhaps he could explain how this came to pass and what steps he is taking to ensure a does not happen again in future.  when the Provisional settlement was announced, the Secretary of State said, and I  concerns that the poorest councils or those in the north would suffer disproportionately are well wide of the mark. The spending power for places in the north compares well with those in the  I'm afraid that the figures simply do not support that  Let's take a comparison between Wokingham and leaves. The final figures in the government's documents show the spending power per dwelling in Leeds will be 874 in 2013-2014, while for working and it will be �1,518. The following year, it will be even  It is a difference of just under �500 -- �5. It is clear that the figures do not take account of relative mean? Why? The percentage of 18-16 four year-olds is three times higher in Leeds and Wokingham. The percentage of a population claiming incapacity benefit is twice as high in Leeds compared to  How can that be fair? I am sure he has seen the map produced by Newcastle City Council. Was he as surprised as I was to notice that the only council from the South East right the way up to the borders of Scotland to have a reduction was Cheshire East? He is right to point this out. Whether I am surprised that is the case I somehow doubt, given the central point I'm attempting to make is the way in which the cuts have been allocated is unfair. If the Minister and the Secretary of State don't like that, what about the Audit Commission? It has produced a report. This is what the Audit Commission had to say. I  Councils in the most deprived areas have seen substantially greater reductions in government funding as a share of revenue expenditure than councils in the last deprived areas. That could not be any clear rough. It probably explains why the Secretary of State is so keen to get rid of the Audit Commission. How inconvenient that an organisation like that dares to speak the truth  The Secretary of State came up with a measure of spending power in 2010. Ministers now publish figures on spending power per dwelling, but not on spending power per head of population. This is perhaps unsurprising, given what the figures show. Taking into account this settlement, the 10 most deprived authorities in England will lose six times the amount in spending power per head of population compared to the 10 least deprived. No wonder ministers did not want to present to the House figures based on population. Which are the councils that are suffering the biggest cut in spending power per head between these two years? The answer is  Hackney. Newham.  Moseley. Blackpool. Tower Hamlets. Middlesbrough.  Kingston-upon-Hull. Right in the middle is the district councils of Burnley who are taking cuts the same size but have a budget that is a fraction of those unitary authorities. The scale of the cuts is horrendous in this particular councils. A honourable friend is right and he anticipates what I'm about to say. How can that list be fair? The Prime Minister says we are all in this together. He gets laughed at when he does so. His local authority, which is actually one of the least deprive in the country, ranks 316th out of 325 in the indices of multiple  In this settlement, it is getting an increase in spending 1%. How does that work, Eric? Hastings and Burnley, which I respect of a 19th and 11th out of  are facing the maximum cut in spending power on the government's own measure of minus 8.8 %. How is that fair? I will give way. Doesn't he think that, actually, it appears the government benches aren't even interested in protecting of the most vulnerable? It was said that those in need of many bear the burden of paying off  They are not interested in the people of Nottingham and elsewhere that we represent. My honourable friend is right. I think that quote sums up the philosophy the government has brought. I will give way to my honourable friend. It does not surprise me what the Conservatives are doing - helping their own areas.

They are facing a Cliffe edge far beyond 8%. He makes the point extremely forcefully about the circumstances his local authority faces. What does this mean for the future financial sustainability of local Government? The National Audit Office has published a report. It makes it clear that cuts to council budgets are having a direct impact on frontline services, even though the former minister went before the select committee in 2010 and said they shouldn't be any cuts in front line services. The chair of the committee was very direct and her  She said the findings about local authorities, quote, 12% are at risk of being unable to balance their books in the future with disastrous consequences. It is worth reflecting on that wedding  Just over one in 10 of councils now at risk of being unable to balance their books in  The Secretary of State me it saved the graph of doom is scaremongering. Would he also say that is scaremongering on the part of the National Audit Office? What is the Government's answer to that picture that has been unveiled?The Mayor of Liverpool has invited the Secretary of State to our city to have a look at the books for  He can point out where the city council aren't making these efficiency savings that the Government believe we should be  Do you believe the Secretary of State should take up their challenge? I would hope he would be willing to do so. It will be nicer if the Secretary of State did accept that challenge because it would be good to see the impact that it is having on lots of people. Can I warned him that if he invites the Secretary of State, his own record when he was a leader of the council doesn't stand any scrutiny. People like the selves of rowing three-star efficient councils and they were winning and puff -- underperforming councils. Thank you for reminding us. They don't know whether he will accept the kind invitation he has received. No answer at the moment. One of the problems councils face is there is uncertainty in the system because of the changes the Government has brought him. The truth is, it remains to be seen how local authorities will benefit from business rates, localisation, particularly because they've Government has given itself so many ways in which she can take some of that growth and business rates for  The business rate protection for each local authority has been averaged over two years. Perhaps the Minister can say why ministers decided on a two-year period rather than averaging out over a five-year period? On business rate appeals, although the Government has increased the adjustment to this but �593 million, could the Minister say in responding to the debate, whether he is confident about would be sufficient given that the LGA said appeals in the pipeline could be larger than this, thus exposing a level of risk. Why do ministers changed the baseline to include cuts that will not take place until the next financial year? Was this to make the reductions look less than they are? On the point that... A welcome the allegation that has  It doesn't changed. -- it doesn't change. Finally, I want to turn to council tax benefit. Last year Mr Bate, I suggested to members opposite that they should have a long look at what this will mean for their constituents, including areas where the pensioners are higher than average. -- Last year, this debate. There aren't many who have no idea what the coalition has got in store for  Can I draw his attention to the evidence presented to the communities and local Government select committee on the subject of council tax benefit, including from councils like cordon were predicting a crisis when this comes in and issued of rise in homelessness? I think he makes a very powerful 0.2. As there was going to say it in a moment, number of families will be hit by not just one thing but a member of the  It will be the accumulative impact that will be so  The LGA says, quote, authorities will have to introduce support schemes at the against the 10% cut in funding. This will mean many councils have no choice but to pass the cut on to the working age  The technical details are causing concerns. London councils say they are disappointed that the lack of transparency about the funding for council tax in future. They say from 2014/15, the funding calculations will be lost within the wider formula funding allocations and will be subject to the broader cuts to local Government funding. However, by including this funding with an overall formula funding, it means that this already reduces and will be impossible to identify what a local authority receives for its local scheme. Could the Minister confirm whether that is indeed the case and could he explain the reasoning behind the change that he is proposing to make? On council tax we know the Government got itself into a panic and denounced the transition scheme worth �100  They knew there was a car crash heading their way. What we have now found his is a large number of councils are not taking any of the transitional grant. Why is that? You only have to read the report that went to Brentwood  It made it clear it would cost more to do so. They would have received �100,000 from the transitional fund but it would cost them an extra �300,000 to have  That is not much in a way  It is more the economics of the madhouse. We know councils are trying to do their best to protect the vulnerable but attempts cent cut in funding which comes on top of the further cuts announced leaves many with no option but to increase council tax as for the  What does this mean for families? This is a tax rise of people who work hard. Some people who get council tax benefit are  It is a tax rise on carers, the disabled, single mums. The Secretary of State, where he spent time touring the country 0.2 the figure at councils saying you must freeze the council tax, all along he has been masterminding a council tax bombshell for those who can least afford it. For 2 million  they will remember April this year for the bills that will land on their doormats. They will either have to pay council tax for the first time or face an increase. Why would they have the bill on their doormat what do these people have in common? This is where they are being singled out. They don't have a lot of money that is what I call a kick in the teeth. Those families will be looking at the television this. People earn more than an million pounds a year and in that case, because the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State had decided they need a tax cut of �100,000 a year. How was that fair? I will tell the House what it means in Leeds. An estimated 41,000 families will be hit by this tax increase and by the governments equally unfair burden  In some cases, families will be hit twice over. In practical  it will mean �9.4 million will be taken out of the pockets of people on the lowest incomes in Leeds to pay one for higher rent and to higher council tax. It will mean that councils are forced once again to chase people for money they may not have. It is a way we haven't seen since the days of the hated poll tax. I will give away. Would he say in commuters landmine, a will have a dramatic effect on  Wanting those people do is spend money and the local  He is right. It is taking potential spending power and demand out of the economy as a time when we have a crisis. It is economically literate as well as being profoundly unfair.

It is unfair and it is unjust. It is unfair to local residents who rely on their local services, and just in the way it hits the poorest areas and the poorest people  That is why we today will vote against this financial report. Given the interest in taking part in this debate, I have imposed a time limit of seven minutes on backbench contributions which will have to be subject to review depending on progress. I have got to say the shadow Secretary of State reminded me of a film that is very popular. It is technically proficient but really ought to have been transmitted in black-and-white. It is so full of dated thinking that it is reminiscent of those things that you sometimes see in the British Film Institute talk on the television about 1am in the morning as a re-run of an -- of a 1960s sitcom. In all the huff and puff and the seriousness of this settlement for local Government and the importance of it, it was rather  That became apparent Joan the interventions. -- during the interventions. There was a degree of denial that I haven't seen collectively since I used to go and visit clients in Wandsworth prison. The reality is at the Labour Party had never been able to understand that they themselves were committed to making significant cuts in public spending, that they would have kicked him in 2015 and because local a Government accounts for 25% of public expenditure, it was inevitable that these reductions would have to bear upon local  It is a bit rich to be saying that we have been behaving in an unfair fashion.
