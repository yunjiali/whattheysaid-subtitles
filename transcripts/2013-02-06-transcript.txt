Welcome to BBC Parliament's live coverage from the House of Commons.  David Cameron will face the Labour leader Ed Miliband and backbenchers for Prime Minister's  Mr Cameron will then make a statement on the conclusions of the public inquiry into failings at mid- Staffordshire NHS Trust. Hundreds of pigeons were neglected at Stafford Hospital between 2005  receiving what a previous report called appalling levels of  There are the Treasury Minister will make a statement of financial services, and then the Democratic Unionist Party have tabled a debate on suicide prevention in the UK. Join me for a round-up of the day in both houses of parliament at 11  First, questions to the Cabinet Office minister Francis Question number one. The Government committed the �13 billion to charities in 2009-10, but the data is not yet available for 2012-2013. Many of our constituents depend on the services provided by voluntary  It is estimated that funding for the sector will fall by 2 billion during the course of this Parliament. The Charities Aid Foundation said that private giving to charities is down 20%. The Big Society is shrinking. What is the Government going to do to provide the resources needed to provide services to our constituents. There are government is doing a great deal to support charities, volunteering and social investment to make it easier for charities to help deliver services. There is less money around as a consequence of the actions of the Government he did not adorn. We all have a role and a responsibility to support  but this government is doing its bit. But in that very same research from the Charities Aid Foundation, it showed that 85% of respondents were clearly concerned about the future financial viability of charitable giving in this country. Given the Minister's response to my honourable friend, why doesn't he shared those same concerns? I don't need lectures from the benches opposite about how much pressure the charitable sector is under. At a time when resources are constrained, the Treasury has introduced new tax incentives  We introduced a donation scheme worth millions to the sector. This government is showing a lot of creativity in terms of trying to connect people with the chance to give an support charities in their Would my honourable friend agree that when we look at the Kent Air Ambulance, and the Pilgrims Hospice in Canterbury, and at homeless charities, it is a healthy sector in Kent. But would he agree that the most successful element of the chair to the sector are those that raise the bulk of the funds themselves with help from  rather than the growth of client organisations under the last government? My honourable friend is entirely supportive of charities in his constituency, and it is worth reminding of the House that 75% of charities receive no income from the state. 8% of the public funding that goes charities goes to organisations that have in excess of �1 million. We are trying to encourage more charities to live and raise money by their remains. The Government is doing a great deal to increase the capacity of We have delivered the world's first social investment institution Big Society capital that will have �600 million on its balance sheet to grow the Social Investment Market and make it easier for charities to access  Would my honourable friend congratulate the new Ford trust in my constituency for successfully securing the manner as a community asset? The obstacles and culture in the world of football, in contrast, have been dreadful. What more can be done to help fans are owned and govern their local club and stop football being a Big Society free zone? I am delighted to congratulate the trust. I understand it is chaired by Maya honourable friends. I wish the supporters of Portsmouth Football Club well in their endeavours. If there is anything our department can do to support that community, she must let me know. When I went to the fair play offices in Derbyshire or the other Friday and met fair play people who look after disabled teenagers and so on and various other voluntary organisations, their story is that they are being cut left, right and  They are having a job to make ends meet. When will this Government help the voluntary people who are trying to help all kinds of individuals? It has reached a chronic stage. Get something done!We are doing a  I accept that there is pressure on charities. We all know there is less money around. I would like to hear more recognition from the benches opposite as to why the cuts in public expenditure are  They are the result of the fiscal irresponsibility of his  As he reflects on the capacity of the voluntary sector, the Minister will surely consider in particular the capacity of the Charity Commission, cut by a third on his watch, to prevent charities being used for huge levels of tax  Is the Minister convinced that the new head of the commission understands the seriousness of this case, and is there a plan in place to prevent a  Under this government, we have sent a clear message that we expect charities to hunker down on their core responsibility and protect the integrity of the sector. My right honourable friend the Chancellor announced in the autumn statement that the Cabinet Office and HMRC would explore how to stop tax avoidance and tax evasion. We will make an announcement shortly. That is very welcome news. I hope that in the Budget, friends of the Cabinet Office can make sure the Chancellor announces that we will end once and for all the idea that we have taxpayers' money funding people who avoid paying their corporate taxes. That has to end at national and local level. I very  Our primary concern when doing public procurement is value for the taxpayer. But it is a legitimate concern to ensure that those companies which are correctly profiting from government contracts should be paying their proper amount of tax. Isn't it just a simple process of putting out a message to all companies that if they don't pay their taxes, they don't get the contracts? I don't recall this ever being addressed by the previous government. We have inherited large numbers of extremely costly contracts, where nobody has taken any interest in the subject. Days after the coalition government came to office, we introduced strict controls that saved the taxpayer �316 million last year alone, a figure verified by the National Audit Office. We have opened up procurement a small and medium-sized enterprises. We are moving towards higher standards and we are rogue -- reopening some of the contracts we inherited from the previous government with a view to making further savings. There is more we can and will do. I thank the Minister for that and for visiting a company in my constituency whose data centres make cloud computing possible. With a myriad of data centres in local and national government and in the wider public sector, there are huge savings to be made. Will the Minister target this area in searching for ways to save the taxpayer money? I enjoyed my visit with my honourable friend. It was illuminating. There is a huge amount we can do. Data centre capacity across government is massively under-used. There is a huge amount of overcapacity left in place by the outgoing government, which had no interest in the  We are getting to grips with the subject. There is much more money we can save. But the NAO did not verify the savings. The Department actually overstated the savings he claims to have made by millions of pounds. Andy has form on this matter. He predicted �20 billion of savings in his quango  but the NAO show that he barely said the tenth of that  Perhaps the department should propose a new ministerial Baccalaureate in adding up and  Since he can't get his figures right, will he now redo his maths?The honourable gentleman is talking nonsense. We inherited a massive budget deficit, left by a government that was fiscally incontinent and made no effort to deliver any efficiency savings  Through our efficiency  we have delivered �12 billion worth of savings and there is more that can be done. The outgoing government left the public finances and the state of efficiency in Whitehall in a The Government is bringing forward its a cross government cybersecurity awareness campaign. I ought to quote from the report. I agree that small businesses should be able to embrace technologies and prosper without exposing themselves to unwanted business risks. Cybersecurity should be a growth area for UK industry. Could my honourable friend tell the House what she's doing to help promote cybersecurity for the UK industrial sector? My honourable friend is  There are opportunities for UK businesses. Our country has expertise in cybersecurity. It makes us well placed to capitalise on commercial opportunities on offer domestic pig and overseas. We have put in place measures to help UK products are broader. If only the Minister's warm words were matched by her government's actions.  the Home Secretary announced but the UK would opt out of the cross border co-operation on  Cyber crime is predominantly cross border in nature. Could the minister confirm this? And specifically, whether we will be part of the new European cyber crime centre? Or is her government more obsessed with damaging Europe than strengthening our cybersecurity? I welcome the honourable lady to her place in the team opposite. I hope the Labour Party have updated their website, as I don't think there cyber skills showed her as being in the correct place on that question. But I can reassure her that the UK government is doing all it can on cyber crime. There is much to be done in Europe. Could I ask the Minister to consider forming a reserve or so that people working in the at IT security centre can back fill in those positions that are very  It perhaps cannot be done by the Ministry of Defence. My honourable friend makes correct points about the need to insure that we have a robust skills across both the public and private sector in respect of cybersecurity. There is much to do to build our country's capability. He makes it sensible points about a civilian  The Prime Minister launched contracts two years ago to make government opportunity is more accessible for small and medium- sized enterprises. That is precisely what that side does. I thank the Minister for her letter that I received this morning. We know the Government has about �3 million worth of contracts with that company. Could I ask her now that she has provided those details, what is the reason that the Cabinet Office do not include the contracts renewed since the first January  given that they were renewed and extended by her department? Of the contracts identified in response to the honourable gentleman's inquiries, only seven  Each of them is there. We are publishing more contract information than ever before. We are seeing an increase in the amount of business going to small an tount make an assessment, as she's just referred to, of what happened three years ago? Has she made an assessment as to why small businesses were winning such a small share of Government procured contracts when this Government came We are serious about opening up business to SMEs. It's the shame the previous administration not to have been so. We have made progress both in posting information about those opportunities, as I just answered in the previous question. We have removed bureaucratic, pre- qualification processes and given a voice to the top table and we have made the Government more accountable through the mystery shopper service. It's a shame the previous Government did not do any of those things.  the office of budget responsibility has estimated that this Government's reforms of public sector pensions will deliver more than �4 30 billion of savings over the next 50 years. The minister's answer is good news for taxpayers, it will include the 30 million without a pension. It's important public sector workers receive a good pension. Can you confirm the structure is still in a structure to be fairer to part-time women and lower paid workers? Public second tore pensions after the reforms will remain amongst the best pensions that there are available and that's right, we are strongly in support of that. The cost was out of control and it's now back under control. What discussions are the Government having with Trade Unions representing civil servants to ensure the smoothest possible transition between now and the future? Mr Speaker, we have a regular discussion, both at official and ministerial level with the Civil Service unions who, for the most part, have adopted a constructive approach, who want to see this introduced in a smooth a way as possible and those discussions continue. Almost three times more young people took part in NCS this year and I hope the House will join me in congratulating those people who contributed something like 750,000 hours community service in their local areas. It will grow again this years and teenagers can sign up at nscyes. Co.uk. Young people must take advantage to give themselves a competitive edge. Does my right honourable friend agree that the national citizen service matches graduates with the future skills to help employers? The young people are telling us and the employers are telling us that. NCS is hoping young people develop the character skills, leadership, communication, team work, self-  that will help them succeed in the work place. That is why we are so proud to support it.  would you agree that the national citizen service ought to go in hand in hand with first class citizenship in our schools?  citizenship in schools has been run-down to almost nothing?That's under review by the Department for Education. The point I would like to make is that NCS and programmes like it compliment what is happening in schools, in terms of building confidence of young people and changing the way they feel about what they can achieve and it's hugely valuable  I was delighted to attend a school last year to see dozens of youngsters inspired to sign up for the national citizen service. Can the minister assure me this fantastic scheme will be rolled out, not only across my constituency, but the rest of the country this year? My right honourable friend has been a champion of NCS in his area and I'm delighted to announce that we'll be announcing plans to expand this considerably. I encourage colleagues to tell young people and parents about it and to direct young people to the website at ncsyes.co.uk. My responsibilities are for the public sector, efficiency and reform group for Civil Service  industrial relations strategies in the public sector, Government transparency, civil consin general sis, civil society and cyber security. -- kifl son sis ten sis. -- civil contingencies. Studies have shown that there is a tiny number of children that are benefitting from the national citizen service. Isn't it time we reformed it to help more people or changed it all together? It ill behoves the honourable gentleman to lecture this Government about debt and deficit when you consider the state of the public finances when his Government  Reckless incontinence. National citizen service which we expect to expand is providing an incredibly valuable experience for growing numbers of young people and I'm grateful for his support for it. Mr Speaker, do the coalition Government's -- to the coalition Government's caet credit, four  they started to tackle the scandal of civil servants being given paid time off to do Trade  The Taxpayers' Alliance work out that costs �90 million a  How much savings so far has the Government made of that �90 million? Under the last Government, no-one monitored this. There is a statutory requirement to provide time off for Trade Union due tors, but this was being roundly abused -  We have in place now a proper system of control and monitoring and the cost will be being cut right back. Lots of under 5s do not have access to Internet  Can support be put in place to give them access to these services for things that are compulsory to apply online? We have put in place an assisted digital strategy so that is we roll our our digital by default approach, which will provide services on a much more convenient basis for the citizen at much lower cost to the  that there'll always be available a place where people can go in order that the digital transaction can be carried out with the support of someone to help the citizen. THE SPEAKER: It would be helpful if the House would listen to the questions and answers.  a question asked by my right honourable friend, the member for Epping forest about SME  does he agree, it's not just a question of giving  but also it's essential for the public sector to pay it bills on time? Mr Speaker, I fully agree with my right honourable  He's absolutely right. Not only are there hundreds contracts and opportunities being made available for SMEs, but the Government has a fair champion payment recognised, just as he said. Research published by the charity safe foundation found that one in six charities fear having to close putting the services that many vulnerable people rely on at risk. Can the minister tell the house what action the Government is taking to prevent charities from going to the wall? The Government is doing a great deal to encourage giving in this country. New tax incentives have been introduced and he's working hard to make gift aid  small donations schemes looking at how gift aid can work with digital giving and looking a at how we can do it in payroll. The Cabinet and Treasury are working hard making sure the charities get the support they need. Mr Speaker, what monitoring arrangements for taxpayer funded did my right honourable friend discover after the election and what is his policy on this matter?  rather surprisingly there were no arrangements in place for monitoring the cost of the taxpayer of paid time off for Trade Union representatives. It had been allowed to spiral completely out of under control. The PROBLEM WITH SOUND Why has the Government not carried out the gam bling prevalence survey that was in the 2005 gambling Act? As the honourable gentleman ought  the Office for National Statistics is a non-ministerial Government department which has statutory independence from ministers. Mr Will my right honourable friend ensure that the Cabinet Office keeps a proper record of all the circumstances in which clebgtsive ministerial responsibility is set aside so that we can have some transparnty in relation to their process? -- collective ministerial responsibility is set aside so that we can have some transparency. I will make sure that records are collectively kept. THE SPEAKER: Questions to the Prime  Mr Christopher Chote. This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others and in addition to my dutys in this  I shall have further such meetings today. In thanking my right honourable friend for that answer, and in having given my Right Honourable notice of my question which he may find particularly useful in the sense that it's fair and transparent, and it's also very  can my right honourable friend say that in response to the many concerns expressed in yesterday's debate, will he ensure that civil partnerships are open to heterosexual couples on an equal basis with homosexual couples? I'm very grateful to my right honourable friend and also for giving me notice of his questions. I'll listen care floi what he says  I'm a marriage man, a great supporter of marriage -- carefully to what he says. I want to promote and encourage it. The great thing about last night's vote is that two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married and that's an important advance and we should be promoting  rather than looking at any other way of weakening it. Mr  I want to ask the Prime Minister about the bedroom tax. Alison in Middlesbrough has 18- year-old twin sons both in the army. The Prime Minister's bedroom tax means that while her sons are a way, she'll be charged more for their  She says "I resent the fact both my sons are serving and proteching their country and in return won't have a home to come home to when granted their much- needed leave. "Wtion what's the Prime Ministers answer to Alison -- what's the Prime Minister's answer to Alison?This is not a tax, this  let's make that clear. I'd make two points in respect to the specific case that he raises. First of all, all the time Labour was in Government, if you were in a private sector rented home and you were in receipt of Housing Benefit, you did not get any benefit for empty rooms. I think that is important so it's only fair we treat people in social housing the  The second point I would make is if anyone is away from home, obviously their earnings aren't counted so therefore the benefits I look forward to him explaining to Alison why her paying �25 more a week from April is not a tax on her. As for his point about the private rented sector, he misunderstands the point of social housing. Part of its purpose is to protect the most vulnerable. According to the government's own figures, two thirds of the people hit by  I had an e-mail last week  my wife is disabled, has a degenerative condition and is cared for in bed. Due to her illness and my own medical  I usually sleep in the spare bedroom. Why is it fair for him and thousands of disabled people like him to be hit by the bedroom tax? As with every honourable member, if he wants me or the Department of Work and Pensions to look at a specific case,  But let me make some detailed points. Firstly, there is a �50 million fund to deal with difficult cases. Let me also make the basic argument of fairness that he seems to miss. If you are in private rented housing and receive no housing benefit, you don't get money for an extra room. If you are in private housing and do get housing benefit, you don't get money for an extra room, so there is a basic argument of fairness. Why should we do more for people in social housing on housing benefit than people in private housing on housing benefit? Frankly, he has to engage in another point. The housing benefit bill is now �23 billion a year. We know he is against capping welfare. We know he is against restricting welfare to below the rate of increase in wages. We know all the things he is  We wonder what on earth he  He is spending more than �8 billion more than he planned on housing benefit because of his economic failure during this  The whole point of social housing is to protect  including the disabled. It does not sound like he is going to do anything for military families or the disabled. But let's talk about a group of people he is  I have here a letter sent on his behalf by the Conservative Party treasurer about the so-called mansion tax. It says this. "we promise that no homes tax will be introduced during the course of this Parliament. To keep the taxman out of your home, please help by donating today and supporting the no homes tax campaign". Can the Prime Minister explain, what is it about the plight of those people that he finds more compelling than those hit by the bedroom tax? If he is in favour of a mansion tax, why didn't he introduce one in the 13 years in government? If he is so passionate about social housing, why didn't he build any in government? And if he thinks we are spending too much on housing  he has just said the bill  why does he opposed every attempt we make to get the welfare bill under control? The public can Cassie that we are on the side of people who work hard and want to do the right thing. All he can ever do is spend more money. The Prime Minister should not get  After all, he has nearly half his parliamentary party behind  The policy is not just  it is not going to work  In Hull, for example, 4700 people will be hit by the bedroom  There are just 73 council properties for them to move to. Can the Prime Minister explain how that will work?This Government is building more houses and controlling welfare bills. The question is one that he has to  too. If he opposes the welfare cap and opposes restrictions on increased welfare and reform of disability benefits, if he opposes each welfare change  how is he going to get control of public spending? The clue is in the title, Prime Minister's Questions. He is supposed to try and answer. I thought he might say, move to the private rented sector, because there are not enough council properties for people. When he gets  I should like him to say what those people should do. The policy is supposed to save money, and this is where it will not work. Another woman said to me, my rent for my family home... I don't know why they are growing, Mr Speaker. Thousands of their constituents will be hit by this. Another woman said to me "my rent for my family 68 at present, whereas a one-bedroom flat in the private sector would cost over �100." how can it make sense to force people into a situation where they cost the state more, not less, by moving to the private rented sector?This Government is building more homes  If he supports that, will he now support our changes to the planning system? Will he support the new homes bonus? Will he support the things that will get more homes built and get more people into jobs? We have 1 million extra people working in the private  He has no suggestions for how to get on top of welfare, get our deficit down, get our economy moving or do anything else. So today we discover he has not even got a clue about his own policy that he is introducing in April. His answers remind us what his party and the country are saying  The only people he listens to are a small group of rich and powerful people at the top. That is why he has come up with a policy that is unworkable and  He is a Prime Minister who  incompetent and totally out of touch.Totally pathetic, prescriptive rubbish that we get used to every Wednesday. On the issue of who listens to whom, I have a very clear idea of who he  because we have heard it in the LSE lecture by Len  He said this. "I met Ed  and he asked me this  If you had three wishes, three things you would like us to believe we got back into power, what would they be?" and the answer - trade-union freedom, trade union  trade union freedom. That is who he wants to be the fairy godmother to.James Arbuthnot. At the time of the strategic defence and security review two and a half  my right honourable friend said "my view is that this structure will require year on year real-terms growth in the defence budget in the years beyond 2015". Does that remain his view, and has he heard any similar view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition? It does remain my view, but I'm afraid I am the only party leader who believes that in the years beyond this Parliament, we should increase defence spending in the way he says. But the good news is that it is an agreed a common policy that the defence equipment policy does have real terms increases after 2015. It is important to be able to plan the equipment programme we have that will give us some of the best- equipped armed forces anywhere in The budget for Office response -- the Office for Budget Responsibility tells us that the bankers will pay �500 million less that the bankers' tax than the Prime Minister promised last year. Yet in April, he will include a �500 million tax on the poorest are through the empty bedroom tax. How can he justify taking from the poor and giving to the rich? We have introduced the bank levy, a better answer than a one-off bonus tax. The bank levy will be paid every  and so raise considerably more than a one-off bonus tax. When the bank levy has not come up to the figures we require, the Chancellor has increased it to make sure it does. Can I remind the House of my declared interest.  the Prime Minister will go to Brussels, quite rightly to argue for a reduction in Cap  Will he ensure that any reduction does apply to farmers right across Europe, and not just  and will he make sure he does not fall into the trap fallen into by his predecessor in 2005  who in pressing for cuts, ended up with a cut to the one part that everybody thinks is worthwhile, which is cuts to the Rural Development Programme and the environment. He these will be difficult negotiations. Our aim is for the significant cut I have spoken about. But the point he makes about agriculture is  particularly the flexibility we require to make sure things like the Rural Development Programme can continue to succeed. We know the Prime Minister has met lots of millionaires, but has he ever met anyone who will lose their home because of his bedroom tax? I listened to all of the sorts of cases that the Leader of the Opposition has brought out today. I have RAF Brize Norton in my  so I have many forces families living there. But they say to me that they want a government that is on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing. They support the fact that we are capping welfare, getting on top of immigration and clearing up the mess left by her party.Today is the United nations" international day of zero tolerance to female genital mutilation. Does the Prime Minister agree that Britain should do all it can to combat this dreadful abuse of the human rights of women and girls, overseas and in the UK? I completely agree. She is right to raise this. The Government has made a progress on this, chairing a forum looking at what we do overseas in terms of our aid programme and tried to prevent the horrific female genital mutilation, but also to make sure here that the Crown Prosecution Service and others are aware of the law and do all they can to make sure it is Minister confirm that ATOS have declared that Richard III is ready for work?That is not a constituency case that's come my  but all I can say is, I hope it's going to engender a great historical understanding of these events amongst our people and I hope it will be a great boost to the City of Leicester.  Mr Speaker. This week's announcement of the work of the Stockton Insolvency Service is moving to Newcastle is the latest in a long series of similar announcements affecting the Tees Valley including Middlesbrough's HMRC office by the previous  Will the Prime Minister look to bring extra work to the HMRC office in Stockton, and to moving another public sector agenty to the Kees Valley.What I would  of course, we want to make sure that public sector jobs are fairly distributed around the  We have be frank that the real need to our economy is a rebalancing in the growth in the private sector to make up for the fact that public sector jobs have  If you look over the last two-and-a-half years, the million private sector jobs has more than offset the decline in public sector  That's why we can see unemployment falling. The Prime Minister may not be away of a BBC poll in Northern Ireland which shows that in all six counties there's a majority in favour of the union. People across Northern Ireland recognise that when it comes to being part of this  we are better off together. I somehow try and avoid opinion polls and I haven't seen that one. It looks like one that will lift the spirits of almost everyone in  because we believe in a United Kingdom and we believe in Northern Ireland being part of that United Kingdom.Thank you very much,  Can the Prime Minister reassure this House that he still believes in increasing spending on  making sure that those funds go to the frontline doctors and nurses at the frontline of our service? I can certainly give my right honourable friend that  That is why we committed to increase NHS spending during this Parliament for each year in this Parliament and we are on course to do that. Crucially, we want the make sure the money goes to frontline. That is why the number of managers and administrators in our NHS is right down and the number of clinical staff is right up.  Mr Speaker. Was it the double dip recession, the slow down in deficit redistrict councilion or the protected 60% increase in national debt over the next five years that led the Prime Minister to state that he had full confidence in his Chancellor? Why have confidence in the Chancellor if the deficit is down 25%, there are a million extra private sector jobs and we are cleaning up the mess made by the party opposite.  Mr Speaker. In Dover, plans are moving forward for the building of a new hospital after a decade in which local hospital services were decimated. It will ensure a real focus on the frontline? I think on this day particularly when we'll discuss what happened at the Staffordshire  it is a day to talk about the importance of care in our Health Service, the importance of the frontline in our Health Service and the importance, above all, of really looking at quality and listening to patients. Under this  of course resources have been constrained for all the reasons we have discussed across the despatch boxes week in week out, but we made a conscious choice to put more money into the NHS and to get that to the frontline. That is why there are 5900 more doctors and 000 fewer non-clinical staff. The money's going into the  but the focus needs to be on the quality and the patient. Can I ask the Prime Minister if he serves this party's concern of the suicide levels in our society. Will he assure me and this party of the Government support to raise awareness of the issues and work with administrations across the UK or Great Britain and Northern Ireland? Can I commend the honourable gentleman and the Democratic Unionists for bringing this motion forward and this issue  The whole issue of suicide is one that we often don't talk enough about, address enough about in our society, in our country and it's right to do so. It's a shocking statistic that in Northern  almost six times the number of people killed in rot traffic accidents are lost to suicides -- killed in road traffic  They are right to raise  As a result of the financial mess the Labour Government left the country in, local councils... THE SPEAKER: Let's have a bit of order for Mr  Local councils have faced as tough a budget settlement as other Government departments. Does the Prime Minister share my dismay that Manchester City Council is choosing to close libraries, leisure centres and other services while at the same time was happenify spend hundreds of nos of pounds on an Alesha Keys concert and leave 100 million reserve sitting in the bank? My right honourable friend makes an important point. Of course, councils face difficult spending  But if you look at the level of spending and the level of grant they are still getting in  it's equivalent to what they were getting under the last  Obviously, the economy has declined since then, so we have to cut our cloth accordingly, but they should be held accountable for the decisions they make, and in  there can be little doubt that councils are making high profile cuts to try and make a point and they shouldn't be damaging people's livelihoods, they should be doing the best for their cities.  Mr Speaker. Would the Prime Minister confirm for the record that it's thanks to his cuts to the childcare element of the Working Tax Credit that families with children are losing up to 1500 a year?What has happened under the child Tax Credit is that we increased it by �390 in the early budgets of this Government. If you look at the benefits for a two-  two-child family, they'll be getting over �1,500 extra this  that's �30 a week, compared  I'm afraid the honourable gentleman is wrong. Will the Prime Minister pay tribute to the new person of Somalia whose Government's made remarkable progress over the last few months? Although there's still a long way  will he agree with me that the Somali peace process is a great way of Britain providing care. I think my right honourable friend makes a very important point and to anyone wondering about the relevance of Somalia to here in the  we have to remember this country's been the author of huge amounts of problems from terrorism,  mass migration and even to the most hardened sceptic of our  I would say this is a really good case where engagement, aid and diplomacy can lend itself to the future there. In terms of the Diaspora, I hope they'll give be full support to new President who's showing great progress in that country. When he was a backbench committee member in 2005, can he provide his progressive kurg of that time when he looks at the report from the All Party Group about the awful problems of new drugs that are on the market but are not controlled in any way? -- progressive courage. I'm grateful for the honourable gentleman's view of my career  I won't ask him about  we can agree about it  I think that Home Affairs Select Committee report that I worked on, I learned some important lessons from that which is I think the priority we should give in terms of tackling drugs to education and treatment. Those are the absolutely two key arms of what needs to be done. I don't believe we should be legalising any drugs currently illegal and in terms of current legal highs and indeed problems relating to the last question about things like Charlton  we need to look carefully at the evidence of what works best  In Solihull, over 80,000 people have benefitted from our policy of raising the threshold at which people start to pay tax. This  the IFS confirmed that this policy is right and those who have the broadest shoulders are bearing the greatest burden of tax. In the light of this, will the Government commit to raising the threshold at which people pay tax 000 in this budget? Can I thank the honourable lady for what she said. She's absolutely  which is raising the threshold before which people start to pay tax I think has been absolutely right. What is meant is that someone on minimum wage working full-time, their tax bill's been cut by one half and I think that's a huge change to help people who work hard, want to do the right thing and it's this Government that's rewarding them. She mentions the issue for fiscal studies green budget out this morning, I haven't had much time to study it, but one thing stood out, which is on the issue of fairness, it says "The whole set of tax and benefit changes introduced between the start of 2010 and 2015-16 hit the richest households hardest." this Government is fair and it's helping the hardest working.  Mr Speaker. The leader of the opposition asked the Prime Minister a very simple question to which he gave no adequate reply so I'll ask it again, what is the difference between a bedroom tax on the disabled and a mansion tax on millionaires? I don't accept that the bedroom tax is a tax. It's an issue about benefit. The fact is, as a country, we are spending �23 billion on Housing Benefit. Now, we have to have a debate in this country and the last Government said we had to have a debate in this country about getting on top of Housing Benefit. Indeed, it featured in the Labour manifesto. The manifesto on which they were all elected. Since they have moveded to the opposition benches, they have given up all pretence to that responsibility at all. Can the Prime Minister reconcile his recent comments on the need to accelerate major infrastructure projects with the Government's decision to postpone forming a policy on airports until after the next general election and will he reconsider bringing that review forward? I listened care floi what my right honourable friend said. He'll find if he looks at what Sird how Davies has said in terms of his  he said this is a very complicated issue that merits proper examination that will take  We need, as a country, to make major decisions about airport and airport capacity. We should be aiming as far as is possible to try and make these decisions on a cross party basis and I hope the report will help that happen. Last night's vote, Mr Speaker, on same-sex marriage is widely regarded as an historic vote. Does the Prime Minister agree with me that it's a tribute to all of the people down the decades who in all parties and in no party, behind- the-scenes and in public who've worked for such equality and does the Prime Minister agree with me that the vote proves that the ark of history bent slowly but it bends towards justice? I agree very much with the honourable lady. I think that last night's vote will be seen, not just as making sure there is a proper element of equality, but also helping us to build a stronger and fairer society. I thought many of the speeches made last night were very moving, very emotional. I would pay tribute to all those people who've made this case, some of them for many, many years, saying that they want their love to count the same way that a man and woman's love for each other counts. That is what we have open now in this country and I'm proud it's this Government that's brought it forward.  for years young people have enjoyed some of the lowest school funding in the country in Yorkshire, that is prevalent there. Can he look at low level of pupil funding in the East Riding of Yorkshire? I will look closely at what my right honourable friend has  I would make a couple of  Within the education budget, we have prioritised the per pupil funding so there hasn't been a reduction in per pupil funding because it's very important schools can see forward to future years the sorts of butts they'll have given the role of children coming to their school. The second thing we've done is obviously through the academy programme, to encourage the devolution of more of the school's budget to the schools directly. Y was a motion to strengthen patient and public involvement in the new patient watchdog rejected by the Government in the other place last night? We do want to see patients have a stronger voice in  and we are about to debate in the Staffordshire inquiry how that is done. One of the important ways will be making sure the mandate of the NHS commissioning board has at its heart quality  quality care and a voice for patients. We also need to look at how health Watch will work to make sure it is truly independent. We have to understand that some of the ways we have tried to empower patients in the past, always with good intentions, from governments of both sides of the House, we have to listen when it is said that it has not worked. With more women in work than ever before, with more men in work than ever before, with more jobs created in the private  with the Prime Minister not agree that the chancellor's plan A is not only working, but the economy is beginning to turn the corner? I am grateful to my honourable friend. We should listen to what the Governor of the Bank of England said. He said of course growth is slower than we would like, but the economy is moving in the right direction. The rebalancing is taking place. The things that need to be fixed in terms of bank lending and the housing supply, these things are being fixed. One of my constituents has learnt that when the bedroom tax is introduced, she will have £24 a week to live on. She is so anxious about how she will manage that she is having cognitive behaviour therapy. But her anxiety is understandable. But the Prime Minister agree that those who should be receiving the cognitive behaviour therapies are  namely his ministers, who think she could live on £24?The party opposite has to address the fact that for 13 years in  they were content to have a housing benefit system for people who lived in private sector housing where there was no extra benefit for empty rooms. I cannot understand why they can't see it is unfair to have one rule for people who have the benefit of social housing with the low rents, and another rule for people in private sector accommodation. Week after  Labour MPs and the Labour leader come here opposing this or that benefit change and everything we do to deal with the mess they left and fill the deficit they left  Until they learn that they have to take some of the responsibility for the mess they left, no one will listen to them. Stay month, the Prime Minister. -- statement, the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, today Robert Francis has published the report of the public inquiry into the mid- Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. I have a deep affection for our National Health  I will never forget the things doctors and nurses have done for my family in times of real pain and difficulty. I love our NHS. It is a fantastic institution, a great  It says a huge amount about our country and who we are. I always want to think the best of it and I have queued up narration for the doctors, nurses and other health workers who dedicate their lives to caring for our loved ones -- I have admiration for them. But we do them and the NHS a grave disservice if we fail to speak out when things go wrong. What happened at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009 was not just wrong, it was  Hundreds of people suffered from appalling neglect and mistreatment. There were patients so desperate for water that they were drinking from dirty flower  Many were given the wrong  treated roughly or left to wet themselves and then lie in urine for days. Relatives were ignored or even reproached when pointing out the most basic things that could have saved their loved ones from horrific pain or even  We can only begin to imagine the suffering endured by those whose trust in our health service was betrayed at their most vulnerable moment. That is why it is right to make this statement  There was a Healthcare Commission investigation in 2009, a first inquiry from Robert Francis  And before that, the testimony of bereaved relatives like Julie Bailey and the cure the NHS campaign. They laid bare a despicable catalogue of clinical and managerial Fryatt -- failures at the trust. But even after these  important questions remained unanswered. How were these appalling events allowed to happen, and how were they allowed to continue for so long? Why were so many bereaved families and whistleblowers who spoke out ignored for so long? Could something like this happen again? Basic questions about failures in the system, not just in the  but across the NHS, including its regulators and the Department of Health. That is why the families called for this public  and this Government  I am sure the house will join me in banking Robert Francis and his team for their work over the last three years. The inquiry finds that the appalling suffering at the Mid Staffordshire Hospital was primarily caused by a serious failure on behalf of the -- on the part of the trust board, which failed to listen to patients and staff and failed to tackle what Robert Francis calls an insidious negative culture involving a tolerance of poor standards and a disengagement from leadership responsibilities. But the inquiry finds that the failure went wider. The Primary Care Trusts assumed others were responsible and so made little attempt to collect proper information on the quality of care. The strategic health authority was "to remote from the patients it was there to serve, and failed to be sufficiently sensitive to signs that patients might be at risk". Regulators, including the Healthcare Commission, failed to protect patients from sub-standard  Too many doctors kept their heads down instead of speaking out when things went wrong. The Royal College of Nursing was ineffective both as a professional organisation and as a trade union. The Department of Health was too remote from the services that they oversee. The way Robert Francis chronicles the evidence of systemic failure means we cannot say with confidence that failings of care are limited to one hospital. But let's be clear about what the report does not say. Francis does not blame any specific policy or the last Secretary of State for Health. He says we should not seek scapegoats. Looking beyond the failures that he catalogues, I believe you can identify in the report three fundamental problems with the culture of our National Health Service. First, a focus on  at the expense of patient  This was underpinned by a preoccupation with a narrow set of top-down targets, pursued in the case of Mid Staffordshire to the exclusion of patient safety or listening to what patients, relatives and staff were saying.  there was an attitude that patient care was always someone else's problem. No one was  Third, he talks about defensiveness and complacency. Instead of acting on data which should have implied a real cause  Francis finds that all  there was a culture of only explaining the positives rather than any critical analysis. Managers were suppressing inconvenient facts in favour of looking for comfort in positive information. This is one of the most disturbing findings. It is bad enough that terrible things happened at that hospital. But the inquiry tells us there was a failure to act on the data that was available not just at the hospital, but more widely. As Francis says, "in the end, the truth was uncovered mainly because of the complaints made by a determined group of patients and those close  The angle of the families is understandable. Every honourable member in this House would be furious if their mother, father or loved ones were treated in this way. The last government commissioned the first report from Robert  When he saw that report, the former Secretary of State, now the Shadow Health secretary, was right to apologise for what went  This inquiry not only repeats earlier findings, but it also shows the wider systemic  So I would like to apologise to the families of those who suffered for the way the system allowed this abuse to go unchecked for so long. On behalf of the government and our country, I am  Since the problems at Mid Staffordshire Hospital first came  a number of steps have  The last government set up the national quality board and the quality accounts system. This government has put compassion ahead of process driven, bureaucratic targets and put quality of care on a par with quality of treatment. We have set this out and the mandate to the NHS commissioning board, together with a new vision for compassionate nursing. We have introduced a new programme for tracking and eliminating hospital infections. We have demanded nursing rounds every hour in every ward off every hospital. But we need to do more. We will study each of the 290 recommendations in today's report, and respond next  The recommendations include these three core areas - pace and  accountability and defeating  on which I believe we should make immediate progress. Let me say a word on each. First, how we put patient care ahead of  Today, when a hospital fails financially, it's chair can be dismissed and the board can be  But failures in care rarely carry such consequences. That is not right. So we will create a single failure regime where the suspension of the board can be triggered by failures in care as well as failures in finance. We will put the forces of patients and staff at the heart of the way hospitals go about their work. In mid- Staffordshire, as far back as  there was a staff survey in which only around a quarter of staff said they would want one of their relatives to use the hospital they worked in. Over the following  bereaved relatives and campaigners produced case after dreadful case, campaign after  But these forces were  The hospital was upgraded to Foundation Trust status during  We need the words of patience and frontline staff to bring through the boardrooms of our hospitals and beyond, into the Department of Health itself. From  every patient, every  every member of staff will have the opportunity to say whether they would recommend treatment in their hospital to their friends or  These will be published, and the board will be held to account for their response. Where a significant proportion of patients or staff raised concerns about what is happening in a hospital, immediate inspection will result a suspension of the hospital board  Quality of care means not accepting that bedsores and hospital infections are somehow occupational hazards, that a bit of these things is OK. It is not OK. They are unacceptable, end of story. That is 10 harm, the jargon for  I have asked Dumbo, who has advised President Obama on  -- I have asked a spokesperson who has advised President Obama on this to help. There are simple but profound things that need to happen in  Nurses should be hired and promoted on the basis of having compassion as a vocation, not just academic qualifications. We need a style of leadership from senior nurses that means about poor practice is not tolerated and is driven off the wards. Another issue is whether pay should be linked to quality of care rather than just time served at a hospital, and I favour this approach. Secondly, accountability and transparency. The first report set out what happened in the Stafford Hospital. It should have led to those responsible being brought to book by the board and even by the courts, but this did not happen. Most people would want to know why not. We expect hospitals to take disciplinary action against staff who abuse their patients. We expect the professional bodies to strike off doctors and nurses who seriously breach their professional  And we expect the justice system to prosecute those suspected of criminal acts, whether they take place in a hospital or anywhere  But in Stafford, those expectations were badly let down. The system failed, and that is one reason why we needed this inquiry. The recommendations about systemic failure are public. I believe the regulatory bodies will have a difficult questions to answer. The Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council need to explain why so far, no one has been  The Secretary of State for help has today invited them to explain what steps they will take to strengthen their accountability in light of this report. We will ask the Law Commission to advise on sweeping away the Nursing and Midwifery Council's outdated quality of care in our country. This requires a clear view about what is acceptable and what is not.  Mr Speaker, in our schools, we have a very clear system of deciding whether a school has the right culture and whether it's succeeding or failing... It's a system based on the judgment of independent experts who analyse more than just the statistics. The public therefore knows which schools are outstanding and frankly which ones are failing. They have a right to know exactly the same about our hospitals. We need a hospital inspection regime that doesn't just look at numerical tarts but examines the quality of care and then makes an open, public and explicit judgment. So I've asked the Care Quality Commission to create a new purchase to the Chief Inspector of Hospitals to take personal responsibility for  I want it to start this autumn and we'll look at the law to make sure the inspector's judgment is about whether a hospital is  whether it's safe, whether  rather than just an exercise in bureaucratic box-  In the meantime, I've asked the NHS medical director, Professor Bruce Keo to conduct an investigation into the care of hospitals with high mortality rates.  complacency in the system's meant that all too often, patient complaints have been  So today, I'm asking the honourable member for the area and the Chief Executive of south Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Trisha heart heart, asking them specifically to advise how NHS hospitals should handle complaints better in future -- Trisha Hart. I've talked of some systemic  but at the heart of any system is the people who work in it and the values and vocation they  As Francis says early on in the Report and it's worth quoting  he says this "Health care is not an activity short of systems intended to maintain and improve standards, regulate the conduct of staff and report and scrutinise performance. Continuous efforts have been made to refine and improve the way these work. Yet none of them from local groups to the national regulators from local councillors to the Secretary of State appreciated the scale of the deficiencies at Stafford and therefore over a period of years did anything effective to stop them.".  what makes our Health Service special is this very simple  That the moment you're injured or fall ill, the moment something happens to someone you  you know that whoever you are, wherever you are from, whatever's  however much you have got in  there's a place you can go where people can look after you and do everything they can to make things right again. The shocking truth is this precious principle of British life was broken in Mid Staffordshire. We wouldn't be here today without the tireless come paining of the families who've suffered so teibly and I'm sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the incredible courage and determination over his long and painful years -- terrible. When I met Julie bally and the families again on Monday, she said she wanted the legacy of her loved ones to be an NHS safe for everyone. That is the legacy that together we must secure and I commend this statement to the House -- Julie Bailey.  can I thank the Prime Minister for this statement and for the tone in which he gave it. The NHS represents the best values of this country and what happened at Stafford was an appalling betrayal of those values. We all, Mr Speaker, think of our own loved ones, our mother or father, grandmother or  going into hospital. We are placing them in the trust of the NHS and we expect hospitals to be a place of the utmost compassion and the highest standards of care. At Stafford, patients became victims and their relatives who pleaded for assistance were ignored or even made to feel intimidated. Let me join the Prime Minister in paying tribe yuet to the four  relatives and staff who came forward to speak out, including those who gave evidence to this and previous inquiries --  Let me thank Robert Francis for his work on this and the previous inquiry. Let me also  which was reflected in the Prime Minister's remarks. What happened at Stafford was not typical of the NHS. Day in, day out, the vast majority of those that go to work in our NHS deliver great care to patients up and down the  They are as horrified as all of us by what happened at  The last Government was right to apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS to the patients and families who suffered so badly at Stafford Hospital. I reaffirm that today. We on this side are truly sorry for what happened. What happened has no place in any NHS hospital, we must ensure it does not and cannot happen again. As the Prime Minister makes clear, today the report says that the primary responsibility for what happened lay with the board of the  But there are wider lessons that politicians on all sides must learn, including a lesson for all parties about the dangers of frequent - organisations of the NHS which Francis mentioned. Let me ask a stefbg r specific  On patient voice, effective regulation is essential, but the reality is that regulators can't be everywhere, spotting every  Patients, families and staff are everywhere in our NHS, so we must ensure they are properly  Now, the challenge s to change the culture of the NHS is to listen to those who cam plain. The report highlights criticisms and concerns about previous and current arrangements for patient  Does the Prime Minister  and I think he does in something he said earlier, that whatever bodies we choose to represent patients, they need to be independent and have the powers to be an effective voice and challenge in the system. Second on staffing ; the basic requirements, Mr Speaker, that any hospital has sufficient staff to look at patients. In too  that didn't happen. Compassion should be at the heart of nursing and it needs to be the heart of nurse training so we support the moves that he announced. As Robert Francis previously said in explaining what went wrong "The overwhelmingly prevalent factors were a lack of staff but in terms of absolute numbers and appropriate  Does the Prime Minister accept the report's point that we need to consider benchmarks on staff numbers and skills throughout our NHS? Third on regulation; the problems at Stafford should have been picked up earlier. Monitor and Healthcare Commission should work together more closely. We will look at his proposal around the Chief Inspector of Nursing care. Does the Prime Minister though support the move to a single regulator which is in the Francis Report? And on health care assistants, he made mention of this, who do so much important work in our communities, does the Prime Minister agree we need registration and training of them to improve standard and safety. On Foundation Trust status; the enthusiasm for Foundation Trusts has been shared on both sides of the House and the journey to Foundation Trust status has been a beneficial process for many Trusts. But in the case of Stafford, it clearly wasn't. For the future, has the Prime Minister made any reassessment of the current timetable for other Trusts to achieve foundation status and with a more flexibility -- and when more flexibility is needed. Waiting targets; the report says "It's not suggested that properly designed targets appropriately monitored cannot provide considerable benefit to patients.", in other words, targets have their place but must be kept in their place. Does the Prime Minister accept that as Francis' analysis suggests, the problem at Stafford was how the A&amp;E target was managed by the hospital? And in many hospitals up and down the UK who give excellent care while meeting the A&amp;E target, neither he nor I I want to go back to the days when people were waiting 12 hours on trolleys and 18 months for operations. Let me turn to integration. I believe that there is a bigger overarching issue here which applies, not just in Stafford but elsewhere in our NHS and something that my right honourable friend, the Shadow Health Secretary's talked apblt  The ageing Society of Bringing a whole new -- are bringing a new set of demands on  Elderly and infirm patient who is don't just require physical treatment but much greater care and attention for their basic needs. As the Francis Report said, we must address the new challenge the NHS faces to make sure we avoid a repeat of what happened at Stafford. Does the Prime Minister agree that in every hospital we need to put in place the right support for the whole of a person's needs, including that of the elderly population? And does he further agree that that means breaking down the barriers that still exist in much of the country putting health care provided by the NHS and social care provided by local authorities? We cannot turn the clock back and undo the damage that happened at  but we owe to it those who suffered, to the people of Stafford and to the country as a whole to work together to act on this report and to prevent a scandal like this happening  We on our side of the House will play our part in making that happen. I thank the Right Honourable gentleman for his remarks. Again, also for the tone in which he made  Can I apologise for not giving my response to the report to him earlier this morning, that was a technical mistake, rather than anything more sinister. He's absolutely right, to thank the relatives and Robert Francis for  Let me try and answer his  On the issue of reorganisations, what Francis says is; the extent of the failure of the system shown in this report suggests a fundamental culture change is need. This does not require root and branch reorganisation, the system's had to many of those, but changes which can largely be implemented within the new system that's been created by the new reform. I hope we can agree that the best thing is to learn lessons and put in place what needs to be done. On the issue of listening to patients he's absolutely right to raise this. We have got to make sure, as he said, whatever organisation we have and we have an established health watch that is credible and independent and that it has power. It's interesting in the report on page  what Francis finds he says "It's now quite clear that what replaced Community Health Councils in ten years failed to produce an improved voice for patients and the public but achieved the " we need to make sure health watch is everything we all want to it be. In terms of supporting complains, what Francis is saying and what the Right Honourable gentleman said is when there were complaints, they've got to be given a bigger voice and taken seriously. Here, actually, Members of Parliament have a role  Buried in the report, there's a mild criticism of MPs that like others in the community - we always love our local hospitals and stand up for them and have to be careful to look at the results and work out whether sometimes we shouldn't be giving voice to some of the concerns, rather than going along with a culture that says everything is all right all of the time - sometimes it isn't. Staff numbers and bench mashes It's important there should be  Because of the funding commitment we have made there is an excuse for understaffing and staff shortages but it requires good  The point on a single  because he makes a lot of points about having monitor and the CQC and whether there's confusion between them. In  what he's talking about is strengthening the CQC and gives it greater powers, it's the right direction to go in. He asks about  Both sides of the House have supported the idea of Foundation Trusts, making sure hospitals are more accountable and responsible and able to take more  The problem is not with creating Foundation Trusts, the  if the move to create them means that other things that matter more than Trust status like patient care are pushed to one side. I think the lesson there is that in the next round of Trust creations, they mustn't be rushed and only happen when they are ready and that patient care comes first. In the point about targets, there is a place in our NHS for targets. I think under the last Government, targets became too tight and too obsessive and I think the last Government themselves recognise that and started to change the  The public does have a right to know that waiting times in A&amp;E won't be too long and that treatments will be carried out  so there is an importance  What Francis is saying is that it wasn't the targets to blame but a culture in this hospital and perhaps in others, but he doesn't enquire into that, where targets and their achievement of targets were put ahead of patient  Again, shouldn't be alternatives there. What the Right Honourable gentleman said about the ageing population and the challenge facing the NHS is  That's why it's a key part of our dementia challenge to raise the standards, particularly of how we treat people in our hospitals and I agree that we need to break down the barriers between health and social care. I hope this report is an opportunity, not for trying to find scapegoats or trying to fire up phoney political debate but a moment where nenk the House, because we all love the National Health Service, and when you listen to us this afternoon, we have the same ideas about patient care and quality about and bringing health and social care together, making sure a good rational system really has patients at its heart. I hope this can be a moment when the country comes together over the NHS Today it is a day to think of those who suffered in Stafford and their  I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for the tone they have  I pay tribute to Robert Francis and my honourable friend the member for South temperature, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister for the way in which they have championed the cause of  I know how passionate the Prime Minister is about the NHS and their work which goes on day in,  and I share this. Does he agree but the most important thing we can do for the patients and their loved ones who suffered is to implement the recommendations as quickly as possible so that they can result in an NHS which is safe for all and known for the highest standards of compassion and care? The honourable gentleman, who has spoken up over many years on this  I am sure I speak for everyone when I say we should put the victims up centre. They are in our thoughts today for how they have suffered. I agree with what he said about implementing the recommendations. There are 290, so we have to examine them and see how we can best implement them. The recommendations are not simply for the government or the Department of  they are for every hospital, every nurse and doctor to consider.  for all the changes in the system that you make, a system is only as good as the people that work within it. At the heart of what Francis is saying is a cry from the heart that really, this is about quality, vocation, compassion, and it is those values that we need to get back at the heart of the NHS. I welcome the fact that there has been an inquiry and I welcomed the statement the Prime Minister has  In terms of what has happened in mid- Stafford, it has a effect on the whole of Staffordshire. In view of the emphasis that there will now be on compassion as well last targets, and in view of what the Prime Minister has said about the role of  can I ask if he will arrange for some kind of oversight of local members of parliament in Staffordshire in order that the collaborative way of working that will be needed to introduce this change can be put into practice on  particularly in view of closures which relate to social care homes as well? It is important that the voice of local members of parliament is listened to. The Secretary of State has said he will make sure members of parliament from Stoke-on-Trent can advise him on that issue. But I repeat that one of the things that needs to change in our political debate is, if we are really going to put quality of care up front, we have to look at the facts sometimes about the level of service in some hospitals and care homes, and not always reach for the button that says oppose the local change. I know that is what the honourable lady is saying. Maybe we should get our political culture more in line with what is required in our health  Men the of my constituents in Cannock Chase died unnecessarily in Stafford Hospital between 2005  With the current review on going into the future of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, many remain astonished at the state as it was given in 2009 when these problems were ongoing. Would the Prime Minister agree that the big lesson that can be learned is that when frontline professionals who care about the NHS have genuine concerns about standards of care, we have a system that allows them to speak out without fear of exposure or victimisation? My honourable friend is right to speak up for those victims from Cannock and their families who he  He is right that we have to listen to the voices of victims and patients, and he is right to talk about the reform of regulatory bodies. We have to be careful about thinking that just reforming regulatory bodies would  He spoke about the importance of whistleblowers. It should not be necessary to have whistle-blowing to deal with problems of quality, but sometimes  So we are funding a helpline to support them, to embed rights in their employment contracts and issued guidance in consultants with trade unions.The Prime Minister will accept my disappointment at having a Health Secretary change the law to provide protection for whistleblowers and change the law to make hospital boards responsible for the quality  that those changes were not sufficient to avoid the things that happened in Mid-Staffs. As a  could I say that I welcome the proposal to make it a legal requirement for openness and  but to do that in a litigation obsessed society, it needs to be matched by the introduction of a system of no- fault compensation, otherwise in some hospitals, there is a possibility that the doctors will be outnumbered by a ambulance- chasing lawyers. I will look carefully at what he says about no- fault compensation. The issue of litigation within the NHS is clearly a rapidly rising part of  which is of concern. The point he makes about the laws that he changed is important. From governments of all parties, we have seen a belief that when we change the law to say that quality is important as well as cost and that patient care matters, we change the  but it does not necessarily lead to a change in the culture. To go back to my honourable friend from Cannock, when you look at the  when the issue of trust status came up, people would judge it on a series of metrics which were mainly financial, rather than looking behind those for the  It is the culture change that means that when a hospital  the first thing they look at is clinical standards and  That is what the organisation is meant to deliver, and then the finances and the  On behalf of my constituents and the victims and relatives who have been so traumatised by these events and a lack of patient care, I congratulate my right honourable friend for listening as Leader of the Opposition to my repeated calls in Parliament for a real public inquiry which he established under the 2005 inquiries Act. And for his statement today, including praise for the inquiry itself and for a cure the NHS, in particular Julie Daily and all the others who have campaigned with such passion for  I thank my honourable  He called repeatedly for a public inquiry, and he was right to make that call. That is reflected in the report. What was required was not just looking at failure within the hospital, but to look at the wider systemic failure. Why was this not brought to light more quickly? What was the role of the  and the rest of it? But there is another profound reason for this public inquiry. I know it will not satisfy some of the  who feel rightly that these terrible things happened to their loved ones, and yet where is the criminal prosecution? Where are the people struck off? There has not been proper accountability in  That is why a public inquiry can look to the future and  here is what needs to be  Then if this happens again, there will be much better accountability down the people of Stafford have had. The tragic events at Stafford are having a continuing impact on the University Hospital of North Staffordshire both in terms of management and  Closures of the A&amp;E at Stafford have caused a major strain and our hospitals are already struggling through the closure of beds ordered it earlier. For those very reasons of patient safety, the hospital and rightly reopened many of those beds last year. But that has only added to financial  so when somewhat distant bureaucrats at the pomp of Health and the regional health authority played their part in responding to those pressures, will he ensure that they do so with sympathy, local understanding and that they put patient safety and care at the heart of that response? I agree that when you have decision-making by those above and beyond the  whether it should be a Foundation Trust or the rest of it, they should look carefully at patient care and quality and not just financial or other Metrics. That is at the heart of what Francis is saying. In terms of the hospital today, the seat you see believe it is providing an adequate standard of care. They recently carried out an inspection and were satisfied with what they found. There is important work to be done. Adequate is never good enough. You have to strive for better.Whatever the abject clinical management  this was, at its heart, a disgraceful failure of leadership at all levels. Indeed, there are too many inadequate and failing managers in leadership positions, recycled constantly through the NHS. May I ask the Prime Minister if he will consider establishing a National Health Service staff college to which senior managers  and no senior manager may have command of a hospital trust or anything higher unless he is a graduate of such a college? When my honourable friend has a chance to look at the detail of the report, he will be pleased to say that Robert Francis does suggest something along those lines, some form of leadership college. We think this has merit. I am nervous about committing instantly to creating more NHS organisations, because there are a lot already. But the point he makes is a good  The other point he makes is that all too often, when something has gone wrong, you find managers recycled and appearing as if by magic in another part of the NHS. This goes to the accountability  where we need all of those responsible, the seat you see, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, to take a clear view about whether someone is up to the job or not. I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and the way he made it. Does he agree that the biggest challenge is that you have to make quality of care the central organising principle of the NHS? We can all say that, but doing it creates a series of problems, including the problem of productivity. If nurses, GPs and doctors are spending more time with patients and focusing on care, there are ramifications for other ways that we measure how the health service works. Does the Prime Minister agree that the challenge is how to make a reality of care being the central organising principle of the NHS?The honourable gentleman speaks with great knowledge and affection for  In response to his  I think Francis is saying that a culture change about quality needs to take place. But you also have to look at what we are currently measuring. If hospital managers are measured on financial metrics and targets rather than quality of care, which is what you see in this report, all the words we did about quality of care and the laws we passed do not have a the Government comes up with its full responses, could the Prime Minister give special consideration to trying to change the culture of what often happens when there are  which is to call for the lawyers and changing, so that - - change it so that everybody knows in advance who is responsible for  who is responsible for the clinical care and who is responsible for the management, that they are held to account and that the best practice, which we have often seen in our wards and clinical care, is used to judge what works and be very tough on those who fail? I think my right honourable friend is making two points, one is, we need clear lines of accountability so you can see who is responsible for standards of care on on the ward and in the hospital and they should be held to account for that. Sometimes people making a complaint aren't actually seeking financial  they just want to be taken seriously or listened to. They want acknowledgement. They are not going to go off and hire lawyers, they want acknowledgement that their elderly relative wasn't treated  I hope this report can launch a debate this the NHS about how we can deliver that. There was real trauma and anguish in Stoke-on-Trent about the abuse, poor treatment and unnecessary deaths of friends in the Staffordshire Hospital. Can I welcome the questioning of nursing and medical bodies to ask about the absence of accountability, but two questions: What elements of the new NHS reforms make it less likely that a Mid Staffs will occur  and are we absolutely sure that health watch will be fit for purpose in April? In terms of the north stached forshire health care  the university is taking up a lot of slack from Mid Staffs. -- Staffordshire. Can we make sure north Staffordshire gets support in addressing the problems? Directly to the very important question about the reforms, the stay kus quo that will exist once they are in place and how that will be delivered -- status quo. Francis says he's content this can be  as he says. It requires changes which can largely be implemented within the system that's now been created by the new  I hope the reforms will help in a number of ways. I hope Health Watch can be created as a  independent organisation that's taken seriously by those in the Health Service and more widely. I hope that having clinical leadership of the commissioning  because it's local GPs and others doing that, will mean they reach further into the hospital and will ask better questions in the primary trust. I also said at Prime Minister's Questions that the  what the Department of Health now does, is set a mandate for the national commissioning  at the heart of that, we can put equality and care for  While I said we do -- accept we do need process targets because things like A&amp;E waits  the move towards judging  rather than processes, I hope will reinforce the importance of quality. If you don't get quality care, you are not going to get a quality outcome.  Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister will be aware that Queen's Hospital in Burton, since the closure of the A&amp;E at Stafford, has been dealing with the patients, some of the patients that will have gone to Mid Staffs. Will he join me in thanking all of the staff at Queen's and in other hospitals across Staffordshire who've worked so hard to try and deal with the consequences of the Mid Staffs fallout? And, given that he will understand the genuine concern that there is in my constituency, and across Staffordshire, about health  will he assure my constituents that never again will ticking boxes be put ahead of caring and compassion in the NHS? I can certainly give my right honourable friend that guarantee. I think the whole tenor of this report is that quality, patient  must come before anything  including targets, no matter how important they can sometimes be. I join him in praising those in his own hospital who've been working hard in delivering A&amp;E services. I think if anyone wants to understand just how badly the target chasing and obsession get in the Staffordshire hospital, I think on page 108 in volume 1, there's some really quite chilling evidence about how staff just felt they couldn't complain about quality because they were being chased so hard on the targets that everything else was put to one side.  the Prime Minister's said that concerns of patients' families were ignored, but they and representatives were lied to in terms of their concerns actually. One consequence of what happened in Mid Staffs is that despite no-one suggesting that there is a widespread problem throughout the  nevertheless, there is a real fear that whenever there is a case of poor care in one of our  people immediately jump to the conclusion, is this the wider problem. So I hope, and look forward too the Prime Minister's comments in a moment, I hope this will go to alleviate the fears some people have that when they see one of their loved ones treated in the way that falls way below or slightly below the standard they were expecting, that they can have that confidence to know that this isn't Mid Staffs all over again? I listened very carefully to what the honourable gentleman said and I'm sure he's right. I don't think we are looking at other problems across our NHS of a Stafford-style scale where this went on for year after year and potentially hundreds of people lost their lives prematurely. I think we do know there are problems in our NHS and in individual hospitals. I think one of the things we've got to learn in this report is that, when that happens, don't say everything's fine, don't have a culture of complacency, but let's have a proper way of dealing with  So I think that's the big change that really needs to come out of this. Many of my constituents, both use and depend on Stafford Hospital. Can my honourable friend give them the assurance that future nurse training will be focused on care and compassion and not an obsession with targets? First of all I would say to my right honourable friend, what the CQC have said about Stafford Hospital, it is providing adequate care, there was a recent inspection to check up on it and more work needs to be done on its  Nurse training - we need to get this absolutely clear - nurses not only provide amazing  they're also well trained and can carry out complicated medical  They are proud of that and are often, dare I say it, sometimes better than the junior doctor at putting in canula or whatever it is. We should praid that and we should want to have professional nurses -- praise that. The key to want to change is that as we employ and train nurses, we need to make sure that at the heart of their reason for wanting to do the job is not just access to the qualifications and the career, but a real belief in compassion and caring than it is a vocation. Apart from that, we also need nurses who don't mind wiping people's bottoms, holding the sick bowl under somebody's face. There aren't enough of those any more. The Prime Minister talked about compassion and care. I've had over 000 letters since I first spoke out from people echoing some of the points the Prime Minister's made today and which we all know about as constituency MPs. There must be the opportunity for whistle-blowers to act without fear of reprisal. There must be fee Dom for people to make complaints, to speak out and to say when they've seen something's going wrong -- freedom. I only wish myself that I had spoken out and shouted instead of thinking I was leaving somebody in the hands of professionals, but it didn't extend, I'm afraid, to the care and compassion we'd all expect. I would just like to pay a quick tribute to the campaigners, as the Prime Minister has himself, Julie Bailey in particular who I've also  I've met dozens of those people and their tenacity in speaking out and sticking to their guns I think we would all applaud. I look forward to helping to make the system better because, as the Prime Minister said, we all love the NHS and we know there are systemic faults in it at the moment. I thank the Right Honourable lady for what he says and I'm delighted she'll be helping us with this piece of work to really set out how complaints should be properly  I think she speaks for everyone when she says not only that she loves the NHS, but also that when you see the best level of care handed out to your loved ones, it's one of the most inspiring things in the world. That's why it's so disturbing and hurtful when you see poor standards of care and people let down. The balance we have got to get right is, we must  rightly, praise nurses and health care Assistants and doctors for the care and compassion, for what they do every day. But we must marry that with a determination where there is bad  we should join them in pointing it out and it's this culture of complacency that we've all been part of for too long.  Mr Speaker. I know the Prime Minister shares the shock and the incredulity of the people of Staffordshire, the county where I  where I represent, that such terrible things can happen in one of their local hospitals. I'm pleased that he says that he'll make it easier for whistle-blowers and forfor patients to put on record their experience of care. But can I say a little bit more -- can he say a little bit more about what he expects the speed of that data will be put into the public domain so patients and the public and hospital managers can make quick and informed decisions about what's going on in their hospitals?  I thank the honourable gentleman and, like others in, Staffordshire MPs have spoken up about their local health care service and what it can provide. In terms of the time, Francis says he wants all parts of the NHS to have response to him in terms of what they are going to do across the NHS and that should be done over the  The Department of Health will be in the coming months looking at all of the recommendations and responding  and then specifically on the inspection, of which is so  as I said in my  we are going to look at the changes to the Care Quality  but even before that, Bruce Keogh is going to run the inspections into hospitals that have high risks of mortality and make sure they are being dealt with properly. The 1998 public interest disclosure act is supposed to encourage and protect whistle-blowing. It's failed in this case. When it's been faced with the culture of the National Health Service. It seems to me that what lessons could be  in 2009, the Health Select Committee published a report on patient safety and recommended the Government should look around the world at how whistle-blowing is  particularly New Zealand where whistle-blowing is handled by an independent person who does the inquiry often anonymously from the complainant and gets far better reaction from institutions than what we do here in the United Kingdom? The honourable gentleman makes a powerful point about whistle-blowers and how we handle  I just make the point that supporting whistle-blowers is one  but also you have to respond to what's being said. There were whistle-blowers in the case of  but the problem was to response was completely inadequate.  I do not share the enthusiasm others do for hospitals to gain Foundation Trust status, particularly those that serve less than half a million people. I note with interest that the Chief Executive of Heatherwood who oversaw the foundation status being brought about a few years ago being now retired. That is now £80 million in debt and unsustainable. The Chief Executive in this case cited the old chestnut of stress related illness in order to avoid contributing to the report. When are we going to draw up contracts so people get sacked for poor performance, be it financial or  because as far as I'm  the same should apply to hospital managers as should be applyed to bankers? My right honourable friend speaks with considerable knowledge about the NHS and I think he's absolutely  It is, I'm afraid, depressing when you look down the list of those that were responsible for the Stafford Hospital at the time and what's happened and left on compromise agreement et cetera,  now working somewhere  as I said, the accountability mechanisms aren't good enough. That's why this report is so  Now what I want to see is all of the organisations, whether it's the Trusts, the CCQ, the Department of Health, whether it's the General Medical Council, they've all got to answer the  why isn't bad practice punished properly? That is I think one of the key things that's got to come out of the report. That is not,  everything that those campaigners from Stafford want to  They want more accountable for those involved in this problem and I can understand why they want  but I think what we can get out of sis is a sense that there are going to be proper rules for  THE SPEAKER:These are serious matters being treated with great knowledge and sensitivity. We would now benefit from slightly shorter questions and I need therefore look no further than to a specialist in the genre. Further to the Prime Minister's previous  what precise steps will he do to enforce Trusts not to accept early resignations and moving on? What will he do to stop this recycling which has been going on for ever and ever? I think there are two answers to  There's the contracts that are signed in the first place and every Trust board needs to read the report and think of how they are going to put into place the  The second thing is to make sure that when there are  proper action is taken. With the Prime Minister agreed that elderly wards particularly need regular nurses' inspections? It is an important point. My view is that there is a lot of transparent information available in the NHS, but it is not properly acted on. We need from the Chief Inspector of hospitals a sense that like schools, you look at the data, look at the quality of care with a professional team and then reach a judgement. People do not necessarily need all  They need a judgment on whether the hospital is clean and cares for people or not. The report is clear that at the heart of this dreadful series of deaths was a failure to see the concerns of patients and their families pursued  The Prime Minister mentioned the Nursing and Midwifery  Does he know that unlike other professional regulators, this body does not have the power to review disciplinary decisions, even when there is fresh information or they think they have got it from? Will he fix that? That is an important point. That will -- that is why we have asked the commission at sweeping away current rules and pudding proper rules in their place. Will my right honourable friend confirm that members of local health and well-being boards, local members of health watch and local constituency members of Parliament should always be welcome visitors at their local hospitals? Yes. As a member of a scrutiny Council or any of the bodies he mentioned, you should be able to walk around and look at awards. But it is worth looking out what the report finds about scrutiny committees and the  There are some good recommendations about how they need to sharpen their act on occasion. The report says on page 45 that there was an unacceptable delay in addressing the issue of the shortage of skilled nursing staff. The sea QCs say that 17 hospitals are operating with dangerously low levels of nursing staff, resulting in poor care. Does the Prime Minister agree that it is time to do something about levels of Nursing and not leave it to hospital boards to decide? What the honourable lady says about the importance of having clear bench marks is right. Over the last few  the ratio of nurses to acute beds has improved. The paragraph she refers to is interesting. It  there is little doubt that the reason for the progress in dealing with the shortage of nurses and the slowness to inject the necessary funds was the priority given to ensuring that the trust's books were in order. Francis is saying that finance targets were put ahead of patient care. That is the change that needs to take place. I have here the executive summary to this report. It alone is 100  The Prime Minister has it acted swiftly in appointing an inspector for hospitals and getting the help of specialists in the  But would he agree that we also need political will and scrutiny? Will he ensure that these findings can have cross-party any scrutiny to drive the changes and ensure this never happens again? I hope we can have a proper debate  I am sure the Leader of  who played a key role in making sure this inquiry happened, will make time for a debate to happen at some stage. It is an enormous report. I have the three volumes of it here. But hopefully, in volume two, it goes through the key areas - the strategic health authorities, the health trusts, what the regulator did, and you can see an outline to the concern that flows through it about a lack of patient care. I would like to compliment the Prime Minister on his statement and the response from my right honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition. In relation to the recommendations, the Prime Minister mentioned the failings at Trust board level. Would he agree to look at the recommendation from the health service section of my own union,  which recommends the establishment of a national intelligence unit linked to a national telephone helpline and perhaps link to management that could identify where these problems are coming from so that the chief inspector could take corrective action? I will look at what the honourable gentleman says. My sense is that there is a lot of transparent information about mortality and morbidity rates and the rest of it. But in too many  there has been an unwillingness to act with enough  We should focus on that as  Of the three main issues highlighted in the report, but I particularly highlight to my right honourable friend the third issue of the defensive culture within the  Historically, clinical negligence issues have highlighted the fact that the hospital takes time to recognise that something has gone wrong. There is a blockage in addressing the issue. My right honourable friend is correct that families are not looking for financial remuneration, they are just looking for an apology. Any future inspection regime should put that at the heart of any inspection they carry out. My honourable friend is right. That is why I put in my statement the importance of tried to have a transparent and Frank inspection system like in  because that challenges the complacency. If you get a report that says a school is not up  the community and the teachers know. It can be depressing while you sort it out, but better that than to leave problems to  I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. I am sure he will agree that care should not be measured as a chargeable unit. But I draw his attention to a report published by the Health Select Committee published in June 2011? Can I ask him how he will ensure that it is just not the frontline staff who listened to patients'  but also a senior management? The honourable lady is  When I meet hospital  what strikes me is that those who say, at hour board  we put patient care standards first, that is the right  If a hospital is not clean and caring for People, it is not doing its job. Never mind if the numbers add up. That is what needs to change. The report identified the problem of inadequate staffing levels, which often lies at the heart of care problems in the NHS. Yet only recommendation 163 of the 290 recommendations mentions earth action in that respect. Would the Prime Minister ensure that the Government will bring forward stronger guidance to benchmark registered nurse to patient ratios on hospital wards in order to address that fundamental problem? There is a role for benchmarking and looking at those issues. But I think we would be missing something if we thought this was all about systems and figures. At the heart  there is the issue of quality and patient care and vocation and compassion. The Prime Minister mentioned that members of Parliament should be involved. When I first came to this place more than 20 years ago, I was stuck on a committee called the Parliamentary Select Committee for the ombudsman, who has the power of a High Court  We used to look at the cases of the health service regularly and bring the board members and chief executive it it in front of us. Why was the ombudsman not involved in this case? It is a good point about how things have changed. Perhaps we should look at that. Let me read what the report says on page 47. It is not good news. The "local MPs received concerns about the trust, but these were largely just passed on to others without follow-up or analysis of their implications. MPs are accountable to their electorate, but they are not experts in health cares and they are not regulators. They might wish to consider how to increase their sensitivity with regard to the detection of local problems in healthcare". I would join others in pleading guilty that  we can be too defensive of our local institutions.  we need to dig deeper into particular complaints. That is one for all of us. As part of the government's response to the report, but I urge the Prime Minister to look at the use of gagging clauses when NHS managers leave the organisation? Health ministers should certainly look at what my honourable friend said. One of the outcomes of this needs to be a discussion about what sorts of contracts are appropriate for board members for their service in the NHS if anything goes wrong. I would like to speak from my recent experience of being chief executive of a children's hospice. The sea QC is a good organisation, but in my  each officer is responsible for up to 40 other organisations, so the attention they can give is  I was pleased that both leaders have said they would support more funding for the Care Quality Commission and give it more  The Nursing and Midwifery Council is something almost as have to be registered with.

One of the problems with my staff Isha was that the public were not at the heart of that organisation. I agree that there are many examples of excellent practice not only in healthcare and patient care, but also responding to complaints and involving the local public. But I have just said what this report says about the Royal College of Nursing and MPs. It says at  the RCN was ineffective as a professional organisation and as a trade union. Little was done to address problems faced by its  That is uncomfortable for the RCN to read, as it is uncomfortable to read what the report says about MPs. But it needs to be addressed. The Care Quality Commission likewise needs to  On page 31 of volume two, it says the Care Quality Commission has an unhealthy culture in which managers are more concerned about public image than delivery. Staff feel unsupported. There is work to be done to get this right. Systems so perfect that nobody needs to be good - that is a pithier version of many recommendations in the Francis  originally said by TS Eliot. Does the Prime Minister agree that it has taken a tragedy to get this report? My dad gave a lecture in 2006 and paddled, a new professionalism. Why? Because he was reflecting the alarm of clinicians at a change in culture that had happened towards a burgeoning management system, with tick boxes and targets taking precedence over clinical priorities. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that systems can't replace professionalism, but will he listen to current professionals who are saying that professionalism is being eroded by things like the working time directive? I agree that one of the things we need is greater clinical leadership across  The report says that things like targets and better financial management were important. You can't have an organisation like  a multi-million-pound organisation with thousands of  without proper management and finances and the rest of it. But there has to be proper clinical leadership and the focus has to be on care and quality. Does the Prime Minister agree that what happened at Mid-Staffs was not just a failure of regulation, but a failure of basic humanity? Apart from a few whistleblowers, ward  nurses, doctors and consultants must have seen what was happening on those wards day after day and did nothing. And yet their professional duty obliged them to speak up for their patience. Will he therefore look at at any issues that need to be addressed in the regulatory bodies to enable failures like that to be tackled?  people who do that should campaign group is in existence "and he added that "Patients need to express their views that the health care commission will remain alive to something or a campaign as opposed to why there's concern. I find the comments from the Head of The NHS at the time utterly unacceptable. Does he agree and will he investigate the comments? He's right to raise the issue that  I think we should be clear though that David Nicholson has apologised very publicly and repeatedly for the failure of the Strategic Health Authority which he was in charge of for some important months during this approach. The report is clear that we should not be trying to seek individual scapegoats and I believe Sir Robert Francis said this morning that too often in the past that's what's happened after a report, find someone to take responsibility, fire them out the barrel of the gun and job done, but that's not the  In my view, he does a good job on the NHS commissioning board  I think, thoroughly apologised and recognised his responsibilities for what went wrong in Stafford. The Trust Board were overwhelmingly responsible.  all the other organisations, including the Strategic Health Authority, need to learn lessons. Speaking as a former care worker, I was the President of one of the biggest companies representing  Development in quality  We need a system to make sure that people have time to do a job and spend time with patients and also have resources, physical and financial, to do the job  Without that, we'll be having this debate about another situation in a decades' time. The honourable gentleman makes an important point. Clearly, Health Service facing growing demands requires growing resours. We are growing those resources but they  At the same time, we have a challenge to meet about increasing productivity and cutting out waste in our NHS which we are  I don't believe that should impact on patient care. Every public sector body has to look at how it can become more productive and efficient. That shouldn't be done at the expense of patient care and mustn't be done at the expense of patient care. That was important for the future. I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to all those NHS staff who go to work with great care, compassion and vocation. Can I ask  in particular, at one staff group that's health care Assistants who deliver so much of day-to-day personal care within the NHS yet have relatively poor access to training and development and also they have no regulatory body. So where these individuals are not acting with care and compassion, they are able to move on to another institution and perhaps not able to perhaps work professionally there The honourable lady speaks with great knowledge about the NHS with his experience as a GP. On the issue of health care Assistants, what the Government's said is that Robert Frances's idea of proper training standards is something that does need to be looked at and I would tend to agree with that. The issue of registration I think is more complicated, potentially more bureaucratic. We'll look at it, but that needs close examination. Hospitals don't exist in isolation. Will Professor Sir Bruce Keogh's investigation into the care of hospitals where the highest mortality rates look at the role with primary care, adults and community care as well in relation to those mortality rates?  of course, I'm sure that he will do that. These things don't exist in isolation, but I hope we can do these sorts of investigations in a more frank way because what we don't want to do is fall into the culture of complacency or, as Frances says, seeing the responsibility for quality to lie somewhere else. With increasing local clinician influence with local councillors and local patients' influence over the commissioning of Health  what is my right honourable friend's assessment of how we can increase that culture of care in particular our local NHS settings? I think there's everything that Frances says in his report about quality and the culture change. I hope under the new dispensation, I hope GPs will have a more leading role and will be more inquirying about the standards of care patients get when they go to hospitals. In the past, there was a slight division too much between primary and secondary  I hope they'll bring them closer together. Can I thank the Prime Minister for  Reports received by  directors Governors and others are part full of data, but in order for people to make sense  so that problems aren't  rather than light be shed  doesn't the Trusts have a duty to people in analysing the  I think the honourable lady's entirely right, that's why this role of the Chief Inspector of Hospitals could be important. There's no shortage of data, as he  The report says on the very first page that "There are a plethora of agencies, professional  all of whom have been expected to do something effective" but it didn't occur. I think it's making sure there's one single body that's got the power, the ability and judgment to say, good practice, bad practice.  Mr Speaker. Will the Prime Minister join with me in praising the brave staff in the community and the hospitals in Cornwall who have been speaking out about poor quality patient care and reassure me and them that the Care Quality Commission will have the resources to make sure that quality care will be delivered in hospitals, communities and social care settings throughout the UK? I certainly join her in paying tribute to health care professionals in Cornwall. I'm particularly grateful as they delivered my daughter two-and-a- half years ago and I'm ever grateful for the brilliant service they performed for me in a very caring environment too. The CQC has got the resources it needs. It's a new organisation, it's had a lot of  big reform of it is  I think it's challenging being asked to scrutinise everything from the dentist waiting room to the largest hospital in the land and I think we need to really work on this organisation and make sure that it can deliver what we  Can I commend the Prime Minister for his words and work on  In the if you culture  it's important that hospital chaplains and networks will know what observer standing they might have and how and where they should channel any pastoral concerns or compliments. On his important prosal for the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, can he tell  would that telling new faculty be available to the devolved hospital services as well? I think the honourable gentleman makes an important point about the role of chaplains. Those that are closely involved with hospitals, if they see anything going wrong, they should feel a duety to speak out, that could be groups of hospital friends or chaplains. In terms of the devolved administrations, I expect there are similar issues in terms of culture, like Frances  in terms of complacency and the issue of putting patient care above targets. They'll want to know the lessons from this too. To tackle the culture of complacency my right honourable friend spoke of, would he take this opportunity to give a clear, unequivocal message to the board members of FTs across the country that they are accountable for the performance of their hospitals and if there's persistent bad care, the buck stops with them? Perfectly happy to do  In terms of their responsibility, they are responsible for standards of care, clinical safety, cleanliness of  as well as for meeting financial and other targets and the buck does stop with them.  Mr Speaker. Thousands of people outside this chamber will be woiryed about what is going on at their own local hospitals - Dr  Could the same things be going on? Part of that will be the willingness of the NHS staff to make the best of a bad job. Does manufacture agree that as part of the cultural change, staff say we'll not put up with poor standards and as part and parcel of  that ward management specifically must enforce the higher standards of patient care? I think my right honourable friend makes an important point which is, there are lots of fantastic practices in our NHS across the UK, but there are problems. That's why I'm passionate about the friends and family test. I saw this in a hospital in Salford where they are so proud of the fact that they ask  the patients, everybody, would you have your friends and family treated in this hospital. They put it up on the front of the door of the hospital and it's on every single ward. Of course, there's no one magic bullet answer to the whole problem, but if there's a problem in your hospital or on a specific ward, you pick it up quickly if there was that sort of very open test and very publicly available test. Thank you, Mr Speaker. In implementing the recommendations of  can my honourable friend assure me that it will seek to break down the culture of those in the NHS who close ranks to close down complaints, rather than dealing with them in a proper, open and transparent fashion so that both they can learn and the rest of the NHS can learn from any failure that's taken place? I think my right honourable friend is absolutely right about that. I think there has been a sense sometimes that when problem os cur, there can be a closing of ranks which happened at Stafford and it's not acceptable. All hospital Trusts will want to learn a Cesc son from that -- problems occur. Does the Prime Minister agree with me that clinicians will welcome this up and down the country. They have fantastic ideas about improving  They can't get the management currently to listen to them? I think my right honourable friend makes an important point and one of the aims in the reforms is to give clinical leadership. As you have that leadership, particularly in the commissioning groups, they are the ones who are really tasking the hospitals and I think there's a much greater chance of what she talks about happening? A legal duty of candour would have ensured the serious failures at Mid Staffs Hospital would have come to light earlier and ultimately would have saved many lives. On that topic, what reassurance can my right honourable friend give to my constituents, Frank and Janet Moore-Robinson who tragically and needlessly lost their only son Jon at that hospital? I think it's absolutely right for my right honourable friend to speak out for the victims and to raise a specific  The Health Ministers here with me today will look very carefully at this issue of a duty of candour and to see if that makes a difference for this hospital and others as well. One of the causes of tragedy is "A failure to... Multilevel reorganisation". What lessons will the Prime Minister draw from this about NHS reorganisations? I think he makes an important point. What Frances says on page four is a failure to apreesh until recently the disruptive loss of corporate memory and focus from multilevel organisations. The changes acquired can be largely implemented in the system which has been created by the new reform. I hope we can allow these changes to be made that Frances is talking about within the proposed structure and I think  all parties, all  should learn from this report and I hope we can allow this structure to bed down and to deliver the changes that everybody wants.  Mr Speaker. My right honourable friend's statement was hard listening for those who care about the NHS and who respect and value the work of the vast majority of those within it. Changing a culture of targets and focus on process is an enear mouse task. Does my right honourable friend agree that one of the ways to improve care is to unlock the innate compassion of those who work in the NHS and caring professions? I think my right honourable friend is absolutely right and I remember going to the Royal College of Nurses' conference in his constituency at Harrogate. This is something that is not ministers saying this to nurses, this is nurses saying this to ministers, that we want at the heart of our  they were telling me, to have this sense of compassion and  Nurses themselves think that some of the training systems have got too far into the classroom and too far away from the hospital ward and they're the ones asking us to get that right and it's good to see the Health Minister's not Will he take a to insure that, if a specific problem is rightly  it does not cloud out the otherwise excellent care that the hospital might be providing? That is a very important point. If we are going to have a challenge to complacency and more frankness and openness about potential failure, we also need to have a more grown- up attitude that a Grote -- failure in one part of one hospital doesn't necessarily mean other parts of failing. I have a personal debt to the NHS. It saved my life when I had cancer  Can I warmly welcome the Prime Minister's statement and his focus on the key measure of how well a hospital is serving his community - which is the proportion of people who work they would be happy for a family member to be treated they? I am not claiming the friends and family test is the only change that needs to happen in the  but if we are looking for something to provide a pretty effective traffic like, then having that plastered on every ward in the country would be a good start. Only a start -- quarter of staff in Stafford hospital would be happy for their family to be treated in hospital they work in. I would say, hold on a minute. We have to take some action. Would my right honourable friend compare the inspection regime to that in  Whereas in schools we have people you are all too willing to  in hospitals we have service users who feel they are a burden to that service. Could we have a regime that monitors the care specifically of those patients who have no one to speak for them? My honourable friend, who has great experience of being on the sharp end of inspections in schools, speaks with great knowledge. It is  because patients in hospital often do not want to say anything bad whilst they are in it, it is important of friends and family test is undertaken while they are at home. I am... I think everything has now been said by  We will move on to the next statement. The Financial  Mr Speaker. I would like to update the House to on the investigations of the Financial Services Authority, the US Department of Justice and the US futures trading commission in to be setting off the light or interest  It is fundamental to the workings of the UK and international financial markets. But Barclays and UBS have previously been fined for attempted rate manipulation. Whilst other financial institutions are under investigation, today's reports relates to RBS. Findings published today by the FSA show that certain individuals in RBS sought to manipulate the market. The FSA found RBS breached two of its principles for business. Between October 2006 and 20th November 10 it repeatedly breached the proper standards of market conduct, it made light-box submissions that took into account his own derivatives trading positions or which took into account of profit and loss of its money-market trading books and it sought to manipulate submissions of others by colluding with panel banks. The breaches of principle five relate to rates in three currencies, the  the Swiss franc and US  From 2006-as recently as 20th March 12, RBS failed to have the necessary risk-management systems in operation. It was a failure to identify, manage the risks and absence of any submissions related systems until 20th March 11 and inadequate transaction monitoring systems throughout. Furthermore, in response to a specific request from the FSA as a result of his  RBS attested that its systems and controls were adequate. It transpires that these were inadequate and so RBS's statement to the FSA was incorrect. These findings are grave. 219 requests for in appropriate submissions were documented and at least 21 individuals were involved, including at least one manager. In the light of this, the FSA has imposed a find of £125 million on  reduced to £87,500 for early  This is greater than the amount imposed on Barclays in proportion to the scale of the offences committed. Also, the US commodities and Futures Trading Commission announced it has than the bank guilty of similar offences in the US and has imposed a fine of $325 million. The US Department of jobless -- Department of Justice has also announced a fine and reached a deferred Prosecution agreement with RBS plc and RBS has accepted a criminal charge for fraud related to its Japanese  The government is clear that any organisation or individuals found guilty of this sort of fraud must take full responsibility and be punished. The FSA's report identify that at least 21 individuals were involved in the  including derivatives  and one manager. Of these, eight have resigned, six dismissed and the remainder are facing disciplinary matters. In the light of the findings in Berkeley's last  the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into this market manipulation and it is committing a large amount of resource including a 40 strong team of investigators. Where laws have been broken in this country, the relevant authorities will continue to make sure they have all the resources they need to make sure those guilty are brought to justice. This action against the perpetrators is clearly not sufficient. In the face of misconduct on this scale, it is right responsibility is taken at senior levels and that is why, although the report clears senior management in this misconduct, it is right that the leader of the investment bank since 2008 will leave RBS after handing over his responsibilities. He will receive is minimal contractual entitlement to 12 months' notice and will forfeit 100% of his bonus and long- term incentive plan awards, subject to clawback, totalling some £5 million and for fitting a bonus he would have received in 2012. This still leaves the question of the very substantial fines the bank will have to pay. Was it is right they felt -- face the full force of regulatory action, the government believes it would be wrong for the taxpayer to foot the bill. In the case of the Financial Services Authority finds, the government changed the system so the revenue from fines would be used for the benefit of tax payers and we have made provision in the financial- services act for all such finds to go to the Exchequer so when RBS pays the FSA £87,500 everything will float directly back to the taxpayer after enforcement costs. £35 million of fines imposed doing 2012 will be used to support Britain's armed forces community with 5 million going to the Imperial War Museum. Money raised from banks for their misdemeanours and wrecked list this in financial markets will be used as a force for good ago to causes which demonstrate the best of British bar  including military causes which provides support to men and women who provide a valuable support to this country and we will allowed details of further disbursements in due course. In the case of the US authorities, I insist the taxpayer should not foot the bill and that is why these fines should be met in full for  present and future reductions from the bonuses and pay of the RBS. The House should note it has been a complex and co-ordinated investigation between the international regulatory authorities and I wish to thank all three parties for their co- operation and diligence in identifying and punishing those responsible. The government has made clear that the RBS should take every step necessary to ensure this scandal never happens again. The structure and culture that allowed these events to take place must be changed fundamentally. It also requires ensuring that IBS is focused on the right priorities and that is why the government supports the statement RBS has made, that it will continue to shrink its investment banking operations and focus on serving its core customers. This will be good for RBS customers and UK businesses in particular. Today's findings are a further demonstration of the importance of the tough and swift action the government it in response to the first findings of the tented manipulations concerning Barclays in June last year. This manipulation happened in many countries but no country has responded as quickly and decisively as Britain has now done. The chief executive designate of the financials conduct authority or refute this and his review was published and the government accepted the recommendations in full in October last year. The government and has proceeded to implement the reforms through the financial-services act. Secondary led decayed -- legislation is published in draft and will be debated in the coming weeks, introducing the new bigger victory and criminal sanctions regime. Like or activities will be within the scope of statutory legislation. Where people have broken the law, the government will ensure the authorities will have all the resources they need to make sure they are punished. The British Bankers Association is being replaced as the operational administrator. The government strongly supports the various international initiatives are taking place to restore trust. It is essential that proposals are co- ordinated at a local level to ensure consistency in the way benchmark are governed and  This case reinforces the need for change is already put in train by the government to bring confidence in our banking system and make sure such events cannot be  The previous regulatory regime make sure no financial... This establishes regulation with a financial policy committee to Over Sabo Regulation, Prudential Regulation Authority to ensure the stability of individual banks and the financial conduct authority as a new independent regulator capable of focusing on the types of issue we were discussing today. There are broader issues to be tackled in relation to the culture and professional standards of the banking system. The commission on banking standards comprised of expert representatives has been established to do exactly this, to identify ways of raising professional standards and of protecting the consumer from the inherently more risky world of investment banking. A 1-thank members of the Commission for the work they are carrying out. -- I want to thank. This is another day of shame for Britain's bangs and it is vital we recognise it as such  not because we stand alone in this and similar standards - that is far from the case - but because we must banned out in the way we put things right. Let there be no excuses. Instead, let us have been doing and fundamental reform. Let us have justice to.

If we hold our financial sector to high standards than elsewhere in the world, that is nothing to shrink away from but is something we must welcome and  That is why we have put in place a vastly stronger system of regulation so that misconduct can be prevented and not just punished.

Does he agree that we need new rules to protect whistleblowers who highlights failures inside the banks and that we must ensure that an offences created to punish misleading statements. Also two probably cover the foreign operations of banks. The Minister said that large fines for RBS would be clawed back from bonus pots and the bank but is it not clear that a fundamental changes are needed to the pay and bonus arrangements across the banking sector? When the Business Secretary says this morning that he has a plan for the RBS shares owned by the taxpayer, does the Minister agree or disagree with this and where comes to the future for the RBS shareholding, or what exactly is the Government's's policy today? Taxpayers and bank customers are sick and tired of being let down by the banks day after day and doesn't do to all boil down to a question of trust?

Our economy needs a healthy and sustainable banking sector so we must rapidly clean up the system and the UK financial services on that path towards respectability, integrity and professionalism. It is right that we do that and I have been very clear that the steps that we are taking our to restore the international reputation of the city and make it pre-eminent as a place in the world in which people can have confidence. I thought he might have taken the opportunity to reflect on the contribution that the previous government made to the decline in the reputation of the  It is not as if the chaotic regulatory regime was not foreseen. Our colleague at the time of the passage of the legislation on setting up the flawed financial services authority said in the debate in November 1997 that the coverage of the FSA would be huge, its objectives would be many and potentially in conflict with each  and the range of its activities would be so diverse that not one person in it would understand the Mall. The then government may almost casually have bitten off more than they can she and the process of setting up the FSA will cause regulators to take the eye off the ball while spinsters and crooks have a field  That is what this side of the House warned the previous government at the time and it was ignored comprehensively for 13 years in office.

Let me answer some of his points. We will have discussions on banking reform. Most reasonable people would conclude that the reforms that we  advised by the Vickers Commission and further advised by the Commission on banking standards, lead the world in this. The report recommended at European level explicitly in depth rinses -- references the reforms we are  He is right that the FSA must investigate the consequences, if there already, for individuals or individual firms, as to whether they ended up losing out as a result of this attempted manipulation. I say a tented because these are rates that are submitted and it is not necessarily the case that a LIBOR reference rate changed in response to that,  The process that was recommended by Martin Wheatley to replace the BBA is under way. It is a regulated activity as soon as the necessary statutes are past. As Martin Whitby said, it is necessary that things are done in a way that does not undermine confidence in the process during the time of transition because this is so fundamental to many projects and  He mentions are the  The power that we have taken through the amendments we made to the Financial Services Act allows quickly to specify any of the bench marks that might be within the scope of these groups and our response has been co- ordinated with the international authorities and there is no one who regards the powers we have as inadequate to the task of dealing with other abuses. In terms of whistleblowers, he is absolutely  It is important that people within banks and financial services should have the confidence to report abuse. It is significant that there is a very small number of people who are responsible for something that has as much of the reputation of many millions of people up and down the country, who work hard day and night for banks, in a career which they have had reason to be proud. It is important for them at least that the institutions that they work and should have their reputation  In terms of the shareholding in RBS, of course it is our intention at the appropriate time to return it to private  I do not think it is right that we should own such a significant stake of a pastry bank -- high street bank. But the fact that we do was a necessity there was given rise to by the crisis that the honourable gentleman and his colleagues will know all about. We find ourselves in the necessary position of owning RBS. As soon as it can be returned back to  the better. I am sure the House will welcome the fact that the US funds are going to be crawled back from bonuses. LIBOR, Syria's as it is, is just the tip of a large iceberg of banking malpractice which is now being  -- serious as it is. Does he agree that if we impose high quality regulation, that will not only be morally right but will attract big business to the UK and it will be in the UK's economic interest? I do agree and the work that his commission is continuing to do on the work and cut off banking is very welcome. We should not be shy of setting very high  In fact, it is necessary. At a time when trust is in flight across the world, there is a particular opportunity for the City of London to establish itself as a haven for probity and safety in a volatile world. So far from this being something that is a threat or a danger to our financial institutions, it is very necessary for the continued prosperity, which I am the whole house want to see  -- am sure. One of the cultures that is very necessary to change is the Banks' unwillingness to lend to small businesses. Has the Minister... The Business Secretary has made his statement today about the RBS and the lack of lending to small businesses, even with the recent initiative. But has the government given any thought to moving the 350 RBS branches that they have to dispose of to the business bank, which would give the business bank a regional and a local presence where small businesses could actually go, discuss and hopefully a Greek loans? I very much agree that we should have more business and locally focused banks in this  And that we can recover some of the personal service that in the past they had in abundance  and could understand the needs of business. RBS is not nationalised and so we cannot direct it in a way but there are forms a we are going to make, in particular in the banking reform  emphasise the importance of increasing competition so that we get new entrants. Some of the divestments that have been required, and some of the entrants that have come into the market recently, have concentrated on lending to small and medium-sized businesses. That is a force for good but I want to see much more of it. May I welcome the statement from the Minister. I would associate myself with the words of the Treasury committee  I do not think the City of London has anything to fear, or should have anything to fear, if we have our regulatory system robust  It will be something that will pass the test of time and it  in the long term, be a great attraction for the City of London.

He, more than anyone, recognises the importance that the City re- establishes its prestige. I think part of doing that and part of sending the signal to the current generation of people working in financial services is to say very clearly that the misdeeds of the past need to be put right. There is  where people have suffered detriment in the past - often small businesses up and down the country - to turn a blind eye  We should be rigorous in hold into account and restoring the harm done to businesses that have suffered from past mis-selling. When we do that, we should look to recover the cost of that from the perpetrators. That is a principle the Chancellor has set out and I the BBA will have nothing to do  But it is also how it is calculated? How will we have transparency and confidence to know the rates submitted by the banks are the rates at which they can borrow money rather than act of fiction which we saw over many years with many banks?

It is especially true of a bank that has caused the taxpayer to bail it out to the extent it has done for it then to engage in practices that could, had we not taken this action to get  could have led to a further cost for the taxpayer. I agree that individuals implicated should find a better living than trying to work in an industry in which trust and confidence is  I hear what the Minister says about the highest standards of regulation for the City of London, but how does he explain the fact  once again, the American regulators have imposed fines three times higher than those from the FSA and it gives the appearance to be much more robust in their investigation of LIBOR and other issues? What discussions is the Minister have been with the  now that we are having  to ensure that the regulator imposes appropriate fines and does proper investigations to ensure we read out these difficulties. He will know that there has been a long established culture of the very high a finds in  Finds in this country have increased markedly in recent years, as he knows.

It is right to take what he says seriously - that we need to strengthen our enforcement powers. We are doing that through the legislation that has been passed. I thank my right honourable friend for the tough and swift action he has taken on this, but I have a general question in relating to the cultural change that will be  It seems to be enormous. Why does he have confidence that it is achievable? I think There are a number of reasons why I think it is achievable. The first is the contribution that regulation can  It is important that we do have a more exacting Stan -- set of regulatory standards. Second, it is very much in the commercial and strategic interests of banks to restore the reputation that they used to have for trust. Financial services depends on trust. If people do not trust the banks, they will not do business with them and I think the penny has dropped across the city. I find chief- executive understand that connection between their future profitability and performance and the need to provide decent services to their customers. The third is  and it is being investigated by the committee, there was a failure of the culture of banking, the subversion of culture of banking from one always a so it's - - associated with high standards of  If you like, it was a big occasion and people were thought to be of a rather conservative disposition and inclined not to be willing to take excessive risks. That was averted to the exposure of some practices in recent years and because it was inadequately  I think it distorted what should be the right culture in the industry. So we need to make changes to all three of those  That is what we have embarked on for the rest of this  I follow on from the point made by the honourable member of the City of London. They can be no line drawn in the sand until this corruption is rooted out. My constituents see people for going bonuses but no one being imprisoned for the swindle that have taken  I think they can be no amnesties at all. Can there be an investigation of the elevated -- allegations of the attempts to, in  manipulate the portions in association with the quantitative easing? I will akin to those allegations.

Can I urge the Minister and the honourable member for Chichester and his commission to look carefully at be successful whistle blower incentive scheme which gives whistle blowers a cut of fines and look at how we start to replicate that model here? I will look at that. Of course the discount in fines given for co- operation was one of the ways in which there are reasons for organisations to co-operate, but I will look at that point he makes about individuals. The report indicates that so arrogant were some of the workers in the banks that they treat themselves as masters of the in divorce and a rules of fair play did not be applied -- masters of the universe.

Small and medium-sized businesses are struggling to contact banks at all. I completely agree. My honourable friend for Chichester's Commission is looking at ways in which that professionalism, to be found in the financial services, can be bolstered and further recognised. The public who own over four-fifths of this bank will be appalled at the duration and extent of the greed and corruption exposed by the  Does the Financial Secretary not agree that this strengthens the argument made by the financial services consumer panel that the banks ought to be subject to judiciary duty in relation to their customers, like lawyers and company directors, in order that savers and investors get maximum protection?That is an important point and it will be considered by the commission that is looking into the culture. It is important banks recognise that they exist to serve their customers. That is their purpose. My recent experience of talking to some of the boards at the bank's leads me to believe they recognise the commercial imperative for that. I am sure our colleagues will consider that suggestion. I thank the Minister for his statement. I would like to rip thank him in particular for the £35 million in fines imposed on the banks which will go directly to the armed forces community. Can the Minister confirmed what the criteria for charity groups, for instance there will British Legion and Help For Heroes and how they could qualify for financial assistance?

There are now nearly 400 British service personnel involved and we have had no statement in the House for almost a week on this and I think we deserve one. I have received no notification that any statement will be made on that issue to day. Should that alter, the House will be notified in the usual manner but I'm sure the Treasury benches have heard your I beg to move that leave be given to bring a built on a referendum as to whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Perhaps I should start by saying that the sponsors of this bill and all those who have expressed support very much welcome David Cameron's commitment to hold a referendum in the next Parliament. I have been overwhelmed by support for this bill - indeed be had to draw the sponsors' names that have attacked because there were so many. We welcome his initiative but I would also like to thank the many people who have contacted their own MPs about this bill. It is very much appreciated. David Cameron is  I would suggest, with the British public. Do not refer it to the Prime Minister by his name.  The Prime Minister is in step with the public. The referendum is only right. The EU has fundamentally changed since we first joined it in the early 1970s and it continues to change because of the eurozone crisis. The answer from the eurozone capitals to the crisis is more Europe, more political and economic integration. They have realised belatedly that you cannot have monetary union and,  Save the euro, without fiscal union as well. But this is not why we joined the EU. We joined  not politics. Nobody can deny that the EU's role in our daily lives - a gross sum would describe it as meddling - has grown over the decades and is still growing and yet, we have not stopped to ask fundamental question - is this in our best interests? The timing of the referendum is  It allows time for a renegotiation, to allow us to know what the in part of the referendum question is. I wish the Prime Minister well. It is going to be a  The direction of travel is in the other direction but I hope that he can renegotiate - and he may be able to - a usurp  arrangement, with the EU.  That would appeal to a great deal of people in this country and I hope he does more than prime minister Harold Wilson did in 1975 when he claimed he had repatriated many powers but under close scrutiny, that was a very thin claim indeed and did not amount to a tin of beans. Delaying the referendum a touch also allows for the eurozone crisis to play out and a proper debate as to the merits of membership. So all in all, a very sensible policy. It is right for the country. The British people will finally have their say, having been barred a genuine choice by the political establishment on this issue for probably over 30 years because all the main parties have looked in one direction on this  That is good news and we very much welcome it. And yet this policy is dependent on a Conservative victory in the 2015 general election. The Prime Minister made his promise as leader of the Conservative Party. Legislation will be introduced immediately after a Conservative  It has become a party political issue. And as such, many of us have a concern that there is deep public mistrust of politicians making promises about EU referenda. Too many have been broken in the past and we question whether it will be believed. Many people remember Tony Blair's promise on the EU constitution and the Lisbon  We were promised a  He failed to deliver.  the EU constitution was copied and pasted into the Lisbon treaty and then it was rammed through this House using the then Labour government's majority. Even Gordon Brown knew the sham of the  The then Labour Prime Minister knew the sham of the situation because he refused to join the photocall and signed up to the treaty in the privacy of a darkened room. Right place for it, my colleague says, and I would not  The Lib Dems, meanwhile, have consistently offered a referendum but have failed to  even in Coalition. I see my honourable friend then nodding in agreement from the front bench. He did well in turning round. Scepticism is such, I would suggest to the House, with regard to promises made about the EU referenda -- EU referenda that despite the fact the in, Lisbon treaty had dried before Our Prime Minister came to power has reflected on him. A Bill is far more believable than an election manifesto promise. A referendum would therefore not be dependent on any one party, and any incoming Prime Minister would find it difficult - but group not impossible but typical - to repeal a popular piece of legislation. But perhaps there is another reason to bring this legislation forward. Legislation now would oblige all parliamentarians to declare their  The electorate would then know where they stood. I would suggest that in the past there has been far too much obfuscation on  No wonder the public have become cynical. I am delighted the Conservative Party has adopted  I would suggest that the Conservative Party is more united on Europe than it has been for a long time but apart from the nub of -- a number of principles, honourable members, I think the Labour Party are quite divided. The election manifesto says one thing, the party of Lib Dems in Coalition does another. I would suggest that these positions are untenable. Let's bring forward the legislation and falls other parties to declare  But I would also say to my own front bench that the arguments that we cannot bring legislation - and I am delighted to see the Minister at the front bench and I thank him for that... In the argument that we cannot bring forward legislation in this Parliament because it would contravene the Coalition agreement does not hold water. Same-sex marriage was not in the Coalition agreement and yet yesterday, we  I am afraid that is a very thin argument indeed. Let us not forget that this legislation has no downside that I and my colleagues can see. It would be a very simple piece of legislation. There is no need even to detailed the question, as the Scottish EU 2014 referendum has proved.

We now come to the opposition Day motion in the name of Dr William McRae.Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I beg to move the motion standing in the name of my right honourable and honourable friends and myself. It is on the order paper today. 40 years, the subject we are discussing has been swept under the carpet. I believe it deserves a butcher and thoughtful debate. Suicide is a significant problem in our society. It that impact is often sudden and shocking -- its impact. While we can to some degree prepare ourselves for the death of elderly parents or the loss of loved ones through chronic illness, suicide catches us by surprise. Often there is no warning and we are left with a feeling of utter bewilderment as to what is happening. We ask the questions - was it preventable? Were there warning signs we failed to recognise? Was it simply a cry for help that went wrong? All of these are questions to which we will regrettably never receive an  It can be seen that suicide touches the many lives -- the lives of many people and it is, in every  only a tragedy both for the life that has ended and for the  friends and community that is left behind. We must always remember that each person lost as to say it has been someone's child,  sister or friend and their passing leaves a wind that does not  even with the passing  In addition, those bereaved by suicide have special needs and require special support, for bereavement by suicide is itself a risk factor for suicide. We cannot afford to ignore, or be complacent about, the prevalence of suicide and self-harm in the UK. Preventing suicide prevents a serious socio-economic issue as well as a political challenge and is a problem that we all have a duty to address. There is a great need to change public attitudes, increase awareness and understanding about suicide as a major public health problem that is largely preventable. Every year, almost one million people die from suicide globally and in the last 45  suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide. Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-44 in many countries and although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries  In 2011, 289 deaths by suicide were recorded in Northern  or with the male suicide rate approximately three times greater than that of females. I am that one of the more worrying statistics is that people coming out of prison, in those first two  they are at higher risk of committing suicide. Does he agree that we should make better use of the community and health care pathways so we can protect people, like those coming out of prison? I wholeheartedly agree with that representation and I believe it is important we used the pathway and that it is important every effort is made to ensure that persons who are at a vulnerable moment in their lives certainly receives the best possible help and I will develop  I trust, as I go into this debate. On top of those who leave prison and are vulnerable to suicidal  one of the highest groups at risk are young males who have got involved in the drug  Does he not think it rather odd that, given that  there'll those still campaigning to actually have good I wholeheartedly agree. Although the figures which I gave a moment a .. It is a welcome reduction of the highest recorded figures of suicide deaths in Northern Ireland, it continues to experience higher rates of suicide amongst adolescents and adults, particularly young man -- young men, than any other part of the UK. Deliberate self-harm is also a significant problem with a growing number of cases being seen in  Statistics from the Department of Health and public safety suggest almost 500 patients presented at a hospital emergency department in Belfast with deliberate self-harm over a three- month period from April to 20th June 12 with many more instances never coming to the attention of the health services at all. In 2011, the highest rate of registered suicides were recorded in West Belfast and north Belfast. In my own constituency of South Antrim, 80 lives were lost to suicide. 16 of them at males. I thank my honourable friend for giving way. Is he aware that an international study highlights the fact that Northern Ireland has the highest incident of post conflict trauma of any post conflict region across the globe and that this contributes to the high level of suicide and his evidence in the fact that much of this is concentrated in parts of Northern Ireland where the conflict was at its fiercest? This was added to by the fact that many people suffering trauma served in the armed forces. What we really need in Northern Ireland now under the military covenant is a specialist centre for the treatment of trauma for those who have served our  I thank my honourable friend for his statement. I know the Minister in replying will certainly take the points are being made and I trust he will take them very seriously. In my own  18 lives were lost to  16 of them at males. Between January and September of  223 deaths by a suicide have been recorded in Northern  Again, with socially deprived areas worst affected, but another part of the worrying statistics we are given that whilst it is true that we must concentrate it in north and west Belfast in particular where the rate his  we have been seen - not only in the urban community, but in rural Northern Ireland - we have been seen it coming to areas where people feel isolated and vulnerable to the thoughts of suicide and that is a very worrying thing for myself  I thank the honourable gentleman for giving way.

More people died by a suicide bent as a result of the troubles in our province over a certain period.  I want to congratulate him and his party for bringing this important debate to the floor of  We talked about the fact is linked to suicide. Would he also except that a key factor linked to suicide is a relation to mental health issues? On that basis, what we have to do is take away that stigma related to the on this so people can step forward and asked for the help they badly-needed. I certainly wholeheartedly agree with those remarks and I do believe that the Banford report highlighted the reality between mental health and we have to remove the stigma or connected with mental health. We also have to remove the stigma to suicide because many families are deeply hurt by that stigma. I thank the honourable member. Is the member aware of research carried out by a suicide Saar which showed .. And that it is very dangerous to focus suicide, health and support only in mental health  It is a real risk that we failed to protect those who need  First of all, I would like to thank the honourable lady, first of all for her interest, because she has been seeking to highlight this issues in one of the committee rooms upstairs and that is very commendable and I thank her  There is no one reason for a person coming to that place where they feel that the only way out is suicide. Therefore, I will touch on some of those again... I thank him for his generosity. I declared took interests.

Organisations like The Samaritans and Papyrus ought to be known abroad so that anyone has Axis on the phone to reach them. I wholeheartedly agree because I really do believe that, whilst there are agencies they're available for help, one of the things I have found out is the lack of knowledge within the community at that availability of help is  I think we, as leaders within the community, have got to be willing to say this is not a taboo subject and that the country needs to be willing to open up to  As we say too many young  you need to open up when you have a burden, a problem or isolation. I think we as legislators need to be willing to open up as well and not run away from this issue and say this should be pushed away to the side. I'm delighted my right honourable and honourable friends, and I know we have had support from across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland in bringing this before the  I really feel this is a problem across the UK. One million people across the world in a year came to the point where they took their own lives. The fact is that  That is very serious and we are not immune from that. Not in one part of the region of the UK are we immune and not one family is immune because it can touch every family from whatever that might ground... No matter how rich or poor. They can experience that very same fear and hat. The report also found that on average  deaths are due to sea without have exceeded deaths on the roads and concluded that suicidal behaviour place is a heavy burden on society in Northern Ireland and an annual cost to the economy of 170 million owing to workdays lost and hospital admittance due to suicidal behaviour. Research undertaken at Queen's University in 2007 also found that the Northern Ireland suicide rate has been growing since the mid- 90s which was attributed to younger people, particularly men, taking their own  He talks about young people. Does he know if they have been any discussions between the devolved Nations in relation to preventing young people from accessing suicide websites? It is crucial that Convention takes place. Once again, and deeply appreciative of the intervention and I wholeheartedly agree with his remarks and we will endeavour to take that. As we go on in this debate. Thomson found out that about 150 suicides are recorded annually between 20021004 but by 2006 the figure had risen to  It argued that the end of the conflict in Northern Ireland may have brought its own problems. Figures released by the Office of National Statistics show that in 2011 there were 6045 suicides in people aged 15 and over in the UK, an increase of 447 compared to 2010. The UK suicide rate increased significantly between 2010 and 2011. This trend was further reflected in Wales which recorded three handler  Its highest rate since 2004 and Scotland also saw an increase from 781 deaths by suicide in 2010 to 829 deaths in 2011. By the suicide rate over the last few years would cover the period of the economic downturn. Does the honourable gentleman feel they should be a greater focus on suicide across the whole UK for the reason of the downturn in the economy? A thank my colleague for his statement. Whilst it is true that I have given a lot of statistics and I will come on to the cause is in a moment, they can be very cold things. But I want to draw attention to the House today earnestly and genuinely that behind every one of these statistics is a personal tragedy. A personal tragedy that a person came to the point where they felt there was no other way to go. A personal tragedy because no one can fully understand the loneliness or desperation a person feels they are trapped in whenever they come to the point where they contemplate the only way out is suicide. There is no one reason as to why people take their  It is often the result of problems building up to the point where the problem -- person can see no other way out with coping with their experiences. Factors linked with suicide are unemployment, economic decline, personal debt, painful and disabling illness, heavy use or dependency on alcohol or other  children or adults dealing with the impact of family breakdown, the loss or breakdown of a close relationship, depression, social  bullying or poor education attainment on a daily  These experiences have been shown to make period -- people more susceptible to suicide and it maybe that a seemingly minor event is the trigger for them attempting to take Low self-esteem, being close to  not being able to cope with everyday events are all signs that someone is struggling to cope with overwhelming feelings. Yet it is often very difficult to tell if someone is suicidal or depressed as people in crisis react in different ways and uncharacteristic behaviour can often be a sign that there is something very wrong. One of the main problems that I wish to make during this debate today is, where do people turn for support and help? I want to acknowledge the work carried out by Alfred mine health and social fair -- by our health and social care professionals to career strategies which aim to identify reach your risk factors, established key objectives by a cross section of organisations and seek ultimately to reduce rates of suicide and self-harm throughout the UK. For example in Northern Ireland, I appreciate a ministerial co- ordination Group within the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was established until 1006 to assure that suicide prevention is a priority across relevant government departments and to enhance working and departmental Corporation on the  I was delighted that Edwin Poots changed that group meeting from their needs basis to may give up -- regularly meeting to provide the sustained leadership needed to reduce the high rate of suicide and Northern Ireland.

This work at the coalface is truly inspirational and I pay tribute to those men and women who dedicate so much of their lives to helping  I did say earlier on that people need to note the availability of those who are willing to help and dies say that because about three weeks ago, there was a conference in my own constituency not called by politicians but by the community in Antrim after two suicide had taken  There was this desire within the community to do something so they called people together. I was delighted and honoured to be part of that occasion but what I found out that day was this. There was a multitude of organisations that actually cross the problem, or deal with the problem of a but many in the community do not know about  Many do not know whether help can be got at a moment it is needed.  over the past year, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my honourable friends and colleagues in Belfast and with a non- profit organisation that has been delivering suicide awareness is 2000 today. Through my association, I have come to understand how they believe that people can be more aware of the risk of suicide. Our communities will be safer, more people will be saved from taking their Rome lives. Surely that is what it is all about - prevention rather than... Unfortunately, there is no cure when suicide takes place. I thank him and I am listening very intently and I just wonder whether there is anything the Northern Ireland Assembly all the government  for example, to have publicly funded advertisements on Northern Ireland television and also priests, when they are  raising this matter and alerting the whole of their congregations to the problem itself. Perhaps you are coming on to that in your speech, as well. Once again, I thank the honourable gentleman for his intervention and I certainly will come on to that particular situation and I certainly have endeavour to myself, when I am speaking in congregations, to remind people of the loneliness that people experience when they are not most vulnerable situation. And nobody knows the depths of that value or Hala dark at night is that they are walking through and therefore there has to be a greater understanding. -- how dark that  In Antrim, people were expressing their own experiences. I found that was not only helpful to them but helpful to our understanding and a community's understanding of the situation. Members will also be aware that I have spoken recently in the House concerning Internet safety following horrific reports in the  where young people have taken their own lives as a result of cyber bullying. I thank my honourable friend for giving way and just before he goes further run with his comments, he referred to support groups and I met recently whiff Horizons, a local support group in Lisburn, which is struggling but doing some excellent work on a voluntary basis but struggling to get the support they  Many of those people have had experience of family members who have committed suicide. And of those people well-placed because they have walked through the dark  and therefore is greater funding of those groups essential? I thank my right honourable friends for his intervention and could I  in actual fact, the motion does include that and calls on the government to adequately resourced and promote child and adolescent digital safety. It is wider than that but nevertheless, the resources are a problem that these organisations need help with. The Internet and new media are nowadays programme features on youth culture. Young people see the use of technology as a vital part of their social life and the online environment has enabled unique opportunities for learning, connection and communication. Almost 99% of children aged between eight and 17 access the internet. 90% of children aged five to 16 have a computer at home. Although the risks created by the internet and new media idea to be properly  there is growing concern over the use of the internet for cyber bullying and to normalise and encourage suicide and suicidal  A review conducted in 2008 in to save the children in a digital world found that there is a range of material on the Internet that may present particular is used for specific groups of children and  This includes content or sites that promote or give information about behaviour like suicide and self-harm. The report found that whilst some children might be deterred from harmful behaviour by witnessing such  or might find emotional and social support from others experiencing the same feelings, it is clear that for some children there are major risks. Sides providing information about suicide  for example, could increase the chance of a suicide attempt being successful and therefore decrease the chance of that young person receiving help. I thank him for giving away. He will be aware that the hosting of these sites is illegal in the UK, thanks to the Coroners and Justice Bill. Our problem is that many of these sites are hosted from outside the UK and they are not illegal outside. It would require the internet providers to block access. They move them down the access change when you search for them but they cannot block the access. How do we therefore block them from getting in?

It is apparent responsibility to make sure that people are out so they can pick up signs.

It is a reality... And I was talking to folks just at the weekends about this.

Where online discussions or Community's merger round harmful behaviour, there was a risk of what is described as an echo chamber way users reinforce each other's behaviour and negative feelings about themselves. In communication to me, it was indicated that there are some aspects of the way that individuals interact with one another online through social networking sites or online chat rooms that can place vulnerable people at risk by exposing them to detail about suicide methods or conversations that encourage suicide. Indeed in recent years, there have been several widely reported cases of individuals taking their own lives having used websites that have provided specific and explicit information on a suicide methods or have been used to facilitate suicide pact. Restriction of information to act -- about suicide is an established part as a suicide prevention but this is difficult online not least because suicide websites posted abroad are legal in most other countries. A partnership has been established with major companies to prevent this. In 20th November 10, an initiative was launched in partnership with Google to display a helpline number and a highly than visible telephone icon above normal kugel search results when people in the UK use a number of search terms related to suicide. The organisation also worked closely with Facebook to allow it uses to get help for friend whom they believe is struggling to cope, or feeling suicidal. We must express appreciation to this group for his excellent work. These initiatives are to be commended but more must be done. The Department of Health suicide strategy in England recognises the need to continue to support the internet industry to remove content that encourages suicide and provides access to suicide prevention  In Northern Ireland, a strategy includes a new objective to develop and implement internet guidelines which seek to both restrict the promotion of suicide and self-harm, to encourage the circulation of positive mental health messages.

We must have knowledge the good work already taking place but there is of course always room for improvement and I believe that efforts must be concentrated on making the internet is safer place for our young people. I recognise that this is a particularly complex matter and the challenges it presents are multiple. Nonetheless, they are to challenge us that must be overcome for children have the right to be protected from all forms of abuse, violence and farm. Enhance internet safety is only part of the solution to the growing problem of suicide and self-harm. Through a co-ordinated approach, we must effectively address the issues impacting on emotional health, so that we reach a point where so- called suicide websites will no longer be attractive to vulnerable individuals making them obsolete and unattractive to view. We need to think inevitably about what more can we do across government and to the community to reduce the suicide  Mr Deputy Speaker, as I  I trust that my right honourable friends will not only deal with the issues which I have touched on but the families of those that are experiencing suicide because they also need help. I am strategy of Refreshed and it is good to know that is being developed under devolution. I was the Minister who was in the government to launch that. It is important that families with direct experience are at the core of the strategy because they better understand the issues at stake. They can help all of us when it comes to the best way forward.We are meant to speak through the chair not to the member concerned. We are back into the swing of being in opposition and hopefully it can come through the chair. I concur with the remarks that the right honourable gentleman has made because there is no better person to introduce it than himself. He has done sterling work on this and we deeply appreciate in Northern Ireland are work he did but we want to carry that forward and take it to the next step.

But we unite as a parliament and as a country in lamenting the number of people who died by suicide every  I would particularly like to pay tribute to the honourable and gentlemen and to his colleagues for selecting this issue for debate this afternoon. It is so easy to go for other it easier issues and he does this House a good service by having chosen the subject to give it a proper airing so we can debate it and demonstrate to the country but we are focusing on things that matter so much to people so I thank him genuinely for that. I pick up  That the honourable tend to made opposite about the importance of families and their role in listening to them and understanding their perspective and recognising what they go through. Once someone has taken their own life, the impact of that lost lives for lasts with the family for the rest of their lives and we owe them a duty to listen to them and do better at preventing suicide. The honourable gentleman made the point and the shocking statistic of one million lives lost globally through suicide and that in many countries, young people are now at the highest risk  He made the point that males are more susceptible to suicide. Middle-aged men and young men and it is the biggest single killer of young men under the age of 35. That,  is deeply concerning and one only has to stop and think about the turmoil often associated with that individual in the lead-up to the moment when they make that decision and we owe them the responsibility of doing everything we can to address it. He also talked about the importance of recognising the prevalence of the self harm and the disturbing trends there and that is a real concern. He made the point that in Northern Ireland there is a very serious  I think there was an intervention on this side about whether there is a post conflict issue here and I know a lot of work has been done on post-traumatic stress following conflict, wherever it is in the world, and the risks of both young men and women taking their own lives as a result. And I would like to join him paying tribute to organisations like The Samaritans and Papyrus for their work in helping people at moments of real risk. I'm very grateful. One thing that seems to be very important is that There is a signposting from the time of the secondary school for young people as to where they can  which doesn't necessarily end up with teachers or parents or pastoral care because they may not want to share these things with  At universities, we do better to make sure university health services give help services much more quickly than they are able to do because that has been a real cause of crisis and tension and,  suicide risk. I thank my honourable friend. One of the things I am determined to do while I am in this job is to give mental health services and access to them the real priority that they deserve. We have set out in the first mandate to the commissioning Board a much higher priority for Mental Health and it has overhead -- it has their head and establishing a parity of esteem to have access to mental health services looked at to make sure people have the same rights of access that people with physical health problems have had for some time now. Every life taken by suicide is one too many. The Minister paid tribute to rightly to the work of The Samaritans. They undoubtedly prevent a huge number of people from taking their own lives. They do tremendous work in Northern  Could the Minister just explain what public funding groups such as The Samaritans received from the government? I thank the honourable lady for that intervention.

It is important to  Around 4,500 people took their own lives in England in 2011 - a rise in that year of around 6% from the previous year. Although the three average suicide rate has remained steady since 2005  the rise in people dying by a suicide up to 2011 is deeply worrying. We know suicide rates vary across the UK. We know the suicide rate in Northern Ireland is higher than in England.  it is the highest in the UK and Scotland and Wales also have their own very real challenges. The Coalition government is working with the devolved administrations to share evidence on suicide prevention and effective interventions. Suicide is still a major to boot and I think he made this point than the point of the importance of us collectively speaking up about the subject and the way to reduce the number of suicides is not to comply with that to book and keep it under wraps. On  we need to tackle the problem and the surrounding issues  We published a new strategy in September last year for suicide prevention and it was written to help lower the suicide rate and it prioritise is the support for families, those worried about a loved one so they know where to go for help, but also those who were bereaved as a result of suicide. It is critically important they receive help and organisations like Cruse bereavement Care - I should declare an interest that my worth -- wife works for them - it is back at by  The strategy highlights how important it is to help groups at the highest risk of suicide by targeting intervention in the right way and at the right time. In- patient services are getting better  the most recent inquiry into suicide and homicide shows the long-term downward trend in patient suicides continues giving greater priority to health services is critical also. We are chariot -- championing parity of esteem for physical and mental health and another scheme is improving access to psychological therapies. We are treating more people than ever before for mental health problems. Through the Government's mandate to the NHS we have gone further than before in leaving no doubt about the priority the NHS must give to mental health. It makes a specific reference for mental health services to reduce the suicide rate among stay uses of service. And  The honourable member for Bridgend make that we must also be acutely aware and I think she used the statistic of 75% of people who take their own lives are actually not known to statutory services. It is really important for the services to do everything they can but that is not the whole problem and there is a significant issue  We also need to make sure there is enough information about treatment and support and that it is freely available to those who need it, including those suffering from bereavement following suicide. A lot of that will happen locally with local agencies deciding how best to reduce the suicide rate and support  Of recent strategy is not an instruction manual, more of a tools to support local agencies in working out what is needed. Suicide prevention will also be a priority for the new public health system and the outcomes framework has the suicide rate as an indicator. It talks about what the whole system is trying to achieve and what the outcomes should be and identify is the need to reduce the suicide rate. There it is a shared indicator also with the NHS Act comes framework which focuses on reducing premature deaths in people with serious mental illness and that includes  We are tackling stigma around mental health, which she absolutely rightly refers to with the really brilliant Time it to Change programme. It is designed to reduce stigma and break isolation. There was a brilliant debate a few months ago where honourable members in this House talked about their own experiences of mental health and that is so important in bringing it out into the open and recognising that successful people, as well as many others, suffer from mental health problems and it is nothing to be ashamed of. Children and young people have an important place in the new suicide prevention  The suicide rate amongst teenagers is below that of the overall population but that does not mean it isn't a problem. Suicide is still the most common cause of death in young men. On top  about half of mental health problems begin to emerge by We have now had four or five times that suicide among young men is much higher than among young women and we have not actually heard from anyone why that might be. Is there an answer to that question? I thank my honourable friend for that intervention and I would not wish to indulge in to speculation about  The statistics are absolutely clear about the prevalence among young men and it is significantly higher than amongst young women. It is important that we do the research and that is why the government is also committed to  as well, so that we gain a better understanding. I am happy to  He will be aware that research suggests that the reason that women are less vulnerable as they are helped seekers. Young men are not help seekers and they will not articulate the problems that they are facing. That is the major difference - women and girls will go to their friends and talk about their problems.

I thank her for that really helpful intervention and the absolutely -- it absolutely  I am most grateful to her for coming to my rescue on that. More people are coming to my rescue! Following directly... I am always ready to try to rescue! It would be helpful, if it doesn't  and the, to have research as to how well people know where to go to access services. If the Minister could work with local government and the Health and well-being boards to try to make sure we have that research, I have a strong feeling that lots of young people do not know where to go and there is a much better chance that they will do something about it if they  I am grateful to my right honourable friend for that intervention and he is absolutely right about insuring that youngsters know exactly where to go  It must be a priority. The Minister has been very generous. To back-up and support what the honourable member for Bridgend said, I went to go about their reasons my men seems to suffer more from  -- that reasons why. A recent piece of work that was done in Belfast about the problems are that it is much more difficult to get young and middle-aged men to come to visit a GP or confide in someone about their health problems than it is for women to do the same. This is exactly the same problem. It is a lack of willingness to seek out help early enough so I think this is a major problem and this needs to be dealt with by more education and information, particularly for young men. I thank him for that very constructive intervention. He is absolutely right in what he says. To the suicide prevention strategy, it also recognises that the media has a significant influence on what children do and think, as well as promoting responsible reporting in  therefore, it plans to work with the industry to tackle website that encourage suicide. This is the heart of the motion and what it was raising in the House  Misuse of the internet to encourage vulnerable people to take their own lives is utterly wrong. It is deeply worrying about young people can easily be exposed to such pernicious material on the  But we should not dismiss the internet as just a source of harmful material. It also provides an opportunity to reach out of vulnerable people who might otherwise refuse support. The very young men may not be coming forward a might refuse support so it is very much worth remembering that  the internet can be a valuable ball way of helping vulnerable young people. Bury, -- vulnerable young people. Last week, I chaired a meeting about how to protect children and have people from harmful suicide related internet content. The industry representatives at a meeting told me about some of the good work that they are already doing in this area.  Maka they informed me that they have valuable learning to share from the work they are to ring with the Australian government.  In Australia, they have campaigned to get the message out to schools so that youngsters have information about how they can seek help and what we can learn from .. I am most grateful to him for giving way. When a minister convened that particular meeting, could be just be reassured that,  representatives from the devolved administrations collar from the health department's in Northern Ireland and Scotland, were also invited to attend what was obviously the critical meeting to talk with those who provide internet services. I would like, when we have a debate about the UK and as somebody who feels passionately about remaining in the  we have a joined-up government even when we have a devolved administration.

Yes, very much so. I am grateful to her for the intervention and, indeed, in each area in England to the Health and well-being boards will be able to co-ordinate all of this work and in looking at their strategic needs  they will be able to identify issues both relating to suicide and alcohol and drug  I am grateful for her intervention. I hope that I have satisfied the House that we, as a  takes suicide extremely seriously and we are taking real action to help. I am very grateful,  to the honourable member for bringing this to the House's  I would like to add my congratulations to the Reverend and right honourable member for South Antrim for calling this debate along with his colleagues. This is one of the few opportunities that this very important issue has been addressed in the chamber. There have been agenda debates and Westminster Hall debates but a formal chamber debate is not a natural occurrence on this subject and I very much welcome this. If I can start with a quote that was given to me during a recent inquiry at the all-party suicide and self- harm Prevention Group. One of the people said, "so when you are having a discussion about what does suicide mean and the numbers of very small compared to smoking or  what is it all about?" death by suicide rates show the ultimate loss of hope, the ultimate loss of meaning, of purpose and they are in indicator. They may be small numbers but they are very big report impact creators and they are in indicator of what is happening further down the pyramid. This debate is very timely because the publication of the Office of National Statistics shows that we have an increase in suicides in the  In 2011, there were 6045 suicides - an increase of 7.8% on the previous year. Across the  suicides have increased at different levels. In Wales last  there was an 18.4% increase. In Scotland, a 13.8% increase, though Scotland has changed to the data on which it puts its statistics together and it argues  in fact, if it had not changed the statistical gathering information and the classification of deaths by alcohol, it would have actually had a small decrease. In Northern Ireland, the figure is down slightly, by 7.7% at 313. But  it was 260 so we do have  In England, however, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have a 7.4% increase but that 7.4% increase dairies across England. In the  it is 6%. In the north-  however, it is 9.3% and I know that will be of particular interest to you: Mr Deputy Speaker. The highest risk group - and there has been a lot of talk about young people and young men - is actually meant it aged 30-44, with 23.5 deaths per 100,000. The age group 45-59 has the highest rate of suicides amongst women. There is an increase also in deaths among men in this group. When the Office of National Statistics talks about significant increases, they mean that you can be 95% confident that the increase has happened because of some underlying reason and not just by chance. So our job today is also to look at that underlying  What is driving these increases? I looked at research... I will give way. She is now a leading to the underlying reasons. Quite often went members and others are dealing with families, they are trying to come to terms with  and the lack of help has been in trying to identify it within the family circle some behavioural change and they wreck themselves sometimes with guilt us to being unable to recognise some of those problems that have led to the civil side and maybe that is where resources can be deployed. Can I apologise to the House? I have lost a contact lens and have to wear these spectacles. I cannot read by papers with them on and I cannot see you with them off. So you are going to have to... If they  you are really going to have to let me that you wish to They analyse behaviour are to be deaf to try and find something. It's so only if you get a suicide autopsy that you can begin to look at the reasons behind a death. That is a complicated thing that we cannot do in relation to every  but it can give understanding to the wider reasons. Families wondering why their relative died is terrific. The research that we do have access to is important. In research on economic recession and suicide they found there was a clear impact of the recession. It is an increase in suicide rates that may be offset by adequate at welfare benefits, that was their findings. The increase may be offset by welfare benefits. Other measures likely to reduce the impact of the recession included targeted intervention for the  and membership of social organisations. They found that responsible media reporting is also important. Research at the University of Liverpool found that 000 people have taken their own lives in 2008-2010 during the recession. There are ways we can target some of the problems, they are staring us in the face, and causing the increase the we are  Suicide began to rise in the UK in 2008 following 20 years  Figures have risen 8% a mugs and then, and 9% among women. -- 8% amongst men.

Suicide is an indicator of the overall health of the country, a community, and although compared to cancer, heart  dementia, the numbers are  it is a reflection of the overall health, and the ripple effect of helping those impacted by its are great. Other members have spoken about the impact on families, but it is families and communities that I impacted. It is schools,  it is people who have known that individual. People who identify themselves with that individual when they read newspaper  I will certainly give way. Going back to a previous point about the age profile of new suicide victims, has she, going through the research found that men have a certain age, early Forties, and early Fifties, unexpectedly losing their jobs, suddenly lose their self-esteem, and cannot position themselves in what has been the traditional role in the family? Does she feel that there is a role for providing support for self-esteem and repositioning to get across to these people that they have value in any position? To get them back on to a positive track rather than a downward spiral towards suicide?The honourable gentleman has a complicated  the research I have looked at as love that suicide figures in recession, not just in  but across the world, that also goes back to look at the Great Depression that we had in the 1930s. There is no work at looking at the impact on men's self-esteem at assuming that caring role, should I come across that, I will pass it across to the honourable gentleman's way. I was about to talk about the cross-party group on  and self-harm prevention, which I am the chair of, we looked at every type of suicide, and our meetings bring the best authorities that we can go into the corridors of Westminster and to explain and talk about the work that they are  A I am grateful for you to  I congratulate you on the excellent work you are doing on suicide prevention. Could I ask whether the group has looked in to be issued of suicide in the prison service and other tender institutions? Coming from a legal  I was aware of this as  and I wonder if she has any observations about that? I thank the honourable gentleman for his intervention, it is not same area that we are looking at, but I have a prison in my own constituency, so it is an issue that a pay close attention to -- that I paid close attention to, and I hope to have a debate on the work they are doing, it called invisible  where they are building up and re-establishing links between prisoners and their families, between partners and children, because the best sense of hope, the best sense of rehabilitation is to give them a sense that there is a life once they leave prison, that is extremely important work, and one of the ways we could be focusing on improving outcomes for people once they leave prison. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you the honourable lady for letting me intervene, on that point, I suspect the most of vulnerable are those that are leading prison without a place to go to, in much the same way as in my experience, soldiers who have joined the Armed Forces without a family when they  when they leave, they go back to nothing, and it is the people with nothing that are probably those that we must look carefully at when they have a break from routine, such as leaving  or the Armed Forces. They are probably people we should have a great deal of interest in. Would you agree with that? I can tell that be honourable member that a study from Manchester University, I could not remember the name of the  it looked at suicide in the Armed Forces, and he found that the number are suicides in the largest number were young people leaving the forces, usually without completing the basic training, or shortly afterwards, and this would need further research to confirm  but the indications were that it was a feeling of hopelessness that a further attempt to build a family within the Armed Forces, a sense of success and identity, had  that was the motivator or towards suicide. That research needs additional funding, but that was the outcome in the best study I have seen so far. We have looked, Mr Deputy Speaker, at how a coroner's report suicide, and the importance of accurate reporting, I cannot stress this enough. One of the problem is that we have his narrative verdicts, they were introduced in addition to waste that a jury verdict -- to a statue Tory verdict. They were introduced to teach lessons in to have that  Instead of that, they have replaced the verdict, and had become a verdict in their own right.

That is an area that the Ministry of Justice needs to  I know they are doing so. I hope to meet the chief coroner very soon to see how we can take that forward. I will give way. He is a regular attender at the cross- party group. On the point of narrative verdicts, which are  one of the ways which they are avoided in Northern Ireland is that five years ago the coronary service took the decision not to hold inquests in respect to  just to have it recorded, and not put the families berate, unless there was another  That has meant more  and did no more false verdicts -- and no more a false  I thank the honourable gentleman for that intervention. I was not aware of that. I know that for many families, the real trauma is having experienced the death, and that trauma, sometimes it is up to one year later that they have been renewed trauma, and the renewed publicity, it is highly difficult for them, and brings back the process they have made in  -- there renewed trauma. We have also looked at the cross government strategy in preventing  and I will come back to that later, it is the most important issue. We have looked at suicide and bereavement, and have talked to a number of families who have been bereaved by suicide, and every one of them talked about the importance of a Department of Health document called Help Is At  It is very important, and is very helpful, most people don't know about it. We have to find a way of getting it out there. The Welsh Assembly is looking to get it translated into the Welsh language. We are also looking at whether are not coroners would be an appropriate group, as well as the police force. We have learnt that the impact of police investigations is also important, they investigate initially under murder, this is a murder investigation, and families are further traumatised by a feeling that they are somehow under suspicion foray death. Once it is decided that it is a suicide, Mr Deputy Speaker, sometimes the police will wait, and the family are left with no help, no support, and no sense of where they are supposed to go. A suicide death is a lonely death. People stay away, they don't know what to say, they don't know how to approach the  and often have the support that families desperately need is There is the importance of ongoing support for people, from within their community and but in statutory services, to see them through the grief process. This refers back to the question in relation to the deaths of young men. We looked at the use of sport to reach out to young men. Because what is important is to give young men role models of people who have had difficulties in a life, argument who have contemplated  despite success. And often at sports personalities have been particularly effective in doing  We spoke with a state of mind rugby and Greg Bergiers, a Jews live co-ordinator, they demonstrated how successful this  -- Choose Life co-  Does that honourable lady perhaps feel that the role of soaps on TV are methodology to highlight the issues of suicide as  to try and help prevent those .. I'm aware of the key role that soaps have, does she agree as well? Part of the risk is how the suicides are written in  because there have been incidents where a death by suicide in the soap opera has led to  Where there has been a social contagion. There are risks associated and the writing must be extremely careful. I know that many of the soap opera writers take this responsibility extremely seriously because they are aware of that risk. There's been much talk about the recipe websites. This is internet  and it is extremely important that every member of this House is in their schools and talking to the young people about staying safe on the internet. I was at a primary school in my constituency last week. I asked a group of youngsters how many of them had ever received offensive material when they'd been on the  How many of them had been frightened or bullied or scared by what they saw. Every hand went up in that class. That is a world that we all escaped. It is our duty to take responsibility to build awareness and protection in that  I also have to say that the work of the Samaritans is second to  In particular, I would highlight the work that they have done with British Transport Police at Network Rail on the Prevention of suicides on the railways. They have identified areas that have particular problems. They have trained their staff to be highly alert and vigilant. They have provided support to people who Basie entering railway stations where they feel there is a risk. That is a fantastic move forward. I want to look briefly at the health and social care changes that are taking place and the impact that they will have in relation to the England new suicide prevention plan.

This is particularly true when we are entering a time of restricted spending within local authorities. If it is not a statutory responsibility, often it will be  it will be shelved. And there is no guarantee that health and well-being boards will address the suicide prevention or that of the existing plans will survive will be replaced. What will happen in areas where there is no suicide prevention plan or where there is a history of taking an interest in the issue? The areas where there is no local champion, suicide prevention may be overlooked  We are talking here of a suicide prevention postcode  That is part of what we are seeing reflected in some of the figures that we are seeing of increases differentiated across the  There is no formal mechanism for suicide prevention groups to report directly to health and well- being boards in the suicide prevention plan for England. Without such a link, suicide prevention may not reach the agency's and groups will be working in isolation and undermining their value and jeopardising the future. Engagement with the police, GPs and coroners is absolutely vital. In many areas this is poor, patchy and inconsistent. Self-harm prevention and specialist bereavement services remain poor in many areas of the  The evidence from Northern  however, demonstrated the importance of involving community organisations and the voluntary sector in suicide prevention. The existence of suicide prevention implementation groups in every locality was critical to Northern Ireland's success. It ensures that suicide prevention activity is not left to chance.

We will go back and look at the effect of the suicide prevention plan for England, and the impact of the reorganisation in England later. I've said briefly the importance of not linking suicide just to mental health services. The Appleby Report of 1999 suggested that 75 % of those who commit suicide were not known to services. 75 % were not known to services. That is  We must not always look for a mental health link, otherwise we will neglected to provide services that will address a large number of people who take their own  This is an important debate.

I am grateful to take part in this  I want to pay tribute to the honourable member for South Antrim and for all the members of the DUP for actually bringing this important debate to the floor of the House today.

But suicide bereavement is really a different type of bereavement altogether. I say that from personal experience. When I was at school and in the sixth form, I remember vividly one day walking in and a friend saying to me, have you  I won't mention his name? He had taken his own life because he had been bullied at  I still remember all of us students sat in the common room in complete and utter shock.

It is a good start to try and take away that stigma. I paid particular tribute to the members for Broxbourne and North Durham, who have spoken very openly about their own personal battles. But as honourable members have said, suicide is much much wider than just mental health issues. It can be about finance, careers, family  It is important that we do address all of those issues. That is why I welcome the fact that the suicide prevention strategy is  It is important that it's not just a piece of paper. It has to be backed up by action.

We want to change attitudes for the  We have also got a look at why it is so many young men are committing suicide. We have been talking about mental health, better men are not very good at talking. That is part of the problem. As we are going to the digital age, people are spending so much time on their computers, and talking to others is going to lessen over time. I fear that they are going to have a generation he why even worse about talking at -- a generation who are even worse about talking about their problems.

Helping them to cope with somebody they feel might commit suicide, but also to help that family cope with the aftermath of someone who has committed suicide.

When I was at the hospice, I was able to see how fragmented and bereavement services are run the country. If you want specific suicide support, that is even more fragmented.

We today in north Belfast and west Belfast are still paying the prices of that period of violence and bloodshed. Young men and women are still dying. Middle-aged men and women are still dying as a result of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. They are not dying now through murders committed by paramilitaries. But they are dying directly as a result of the  because they cannot, having been brought up in a culture in many cases, as Mike Tomlinson has mentioned, of that kind of violence and so on, they cannot cope now in this period of relative peace and how to cope with that.

It is difficult to be too specific. Every individual's case is different. Undoubtedly one of the biggest factors we find, particularly in my constituency, his loneliness,  drugs and alcohol. That combination together with the context in which they have grown up very often is too powerful and overwhelming a set of circumstances. So we have particular issues that arise in terms of Northern Ireland which perhaps are different than many cases in England, Wales and  We have this added problem and to pressure of coming out of this period of all for  It is only today, as we look back and are research and work has been done, that people realise just how awful that period was.

People are still dying as a result of that period  We see there is also the honourable gentleman from  had talked about the experiences of soldiers and so on. We also see this with people who work in the security services. One of the things that has come to be has been the fact that family members who were with me recently, a dear lady who had lost a number of her family members including two children to suicide. She said to me she feared for other members of her family because of this increasing prevalence of family members copying what other family members  or copying what they are close friends were doing. Again, exacerbated not even so much by his suicide help sites, as it were, websites that encourage suicide, but even on Facebook, this kind of peer pressure as well. Some is very  One of the big problems are anniversaries. Anniversaries become marked. We must do some work in highlighting the risk of anniversaries, and that anniversaries are not best marked by a further death. That is a key piece of work that must be over -- must be undertaken. She is right. That has been mentioned to me by some of the families, that they dread date -- and anniversary coming up because they sometimes it up for days on end, watching over their loved one in case something  They are very aware of this problem as we approach anniversaries. One of the other things I want to mention is the excellent work being done by the integrated children and Young Persons programme on the Shankill Road in my constituency. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was visiting that project just last week. The shadow Secretary of State, who I'm pleased to see on the front bench, has also visited the Spectrum Centre and is aware of that great work done. That is doing immensely important work with trying to help families who have all sorts of problems and  intervention at an early stage and carrying on work, helping and supporting families as they go through school and into teenagers  There is excellent work being done across many organisations. A lot of it helped by government. We just want to see that work consolidated and increased it possible. I'm conscious that other members want  The numbers of families that have raised with me the need to ensure that when young people do go to an a indeed, all they do come to their GP and they are concerned about their state of mind, their vulnerability. They've said to me, it's another good idea to have somewhere like a place of safety, somewhere they can go, somewhere where they can be put in contact with others to understand what they are going through. They are not just given a piece of paper and said to come back in a week's time or given a prescription, there somewhere they can talk to people. I want to commend the Minister in Northern Ireland, the Health Department and the work that is  they've taken this on  One of the most helpful things has been the engagement of the Samaritans in A&amp;E departments. That has really made a difference, especially for self-harm cases. Perhaps the nursing staff are too busy to give that time. But perhaps the Samaritans can provide that time and support.This highlights  and the honourable lady and the excellent work that she  they'd mentioned about best practice and sharing this. There are bound to the lessons we can learn from each of it. I want to close by commending the work that is going on. The Minister in Northern Ireland has taken a very close personal interest in this  He had a workshop recently for community and voluntary sectors. He has met a number of families -- family support groups. He's tried very hard to raise the profile of  It is an issue that is taking very seriously right across the board in Northern Ireland, among all the political parties, community and voluntary sectors. I think it is important that this House should take the opportunities available to highlight it here as  It is one of the biggest problems that we face, certainly in my constituency. I want to commend and thank everybody that has taken  and all of those who are dedicated in my constituency and elsewhere to try to prevent suicide. I want to congratulate the Member for South Antrim, for so ably moving this debate. It is, as we've  a particular problem in Northern Ireland, but it's also a problem across the entire British  I'd like to congratulate my  the Member for Bridgend, the Member for Pudsey and the members will Belfast North for their extremely thoughtful contributions. I want to say that it is easy to blanket a debate on suicide in sociology jargon. But the truth is this. That any death in a family is tragic. But there is something about suicide which is uniquely tragic. I say this as a  It must always leave family members thinking, is there something I could have done? Were there signs that I could have noticed? If suicide is a cry for  family members must be left thinking right to the end of their lives - why did I not hear that cry in the first place? There is something about suicide which is peculiar that tragic. Of course, the individual causes of any particular suicide on never straightforward. They are certainly not amenable to any top-down, one- size-fits-all command and control  But I think there is some unity across the floor of the House that there are positive changes in society that can make a difference to individual lives. And we can offer even better support to bereaved families. We know that suicide is not just a matter of mental health, but it is related to mental health issues. I want to stress here that Labour is committed to tackling the stigma around mental health. One in four of us will suffer a mental illness at one point in our lifetime. As Ed Miliband has said, it is the  unaddressed health challenge of our age. I would be grateful if ministers could assure me around the issue of mental health spending, because there are some indicators that it has been cut in real terms. It is difficult to have an effective suicide prevention strategy unless the basic spending is there. But when we consider the question of suicide, when you cut through the sociology  it seems to me there must be an issue behind recently rising levels of suicide which is related to the fragmentation of families and the fragmentation of societies. Once upon a time, a generation ago, young families could reasonably expect to live in the same street or round the corner from their mother and other relatives. Young men growing up could reasonably expect a secure job, probably the same job that their father did, probably in some parts of the country in the same place where many people in their community work. It does seem to me that the increasing fragmentation of families and society, which is not the fault of any political party or  it's partly the nature of the society we live in and globalisation, but it must lead to less resilience in families and  It must make the issue of suicide a more pressing one. As members will have heard, the latest suicide figures for England and Wales show an increase in the number of people who have taken their own lives. In particular, there appears to have been a significant increase from 2010 to  As we've heard in a number of contributions, historically, more men completed suicide attempts. But we also heard interesting contributions about how the rise of cyber-bullying is triggering  There was a very sad case a few weeks ago in London about a girl who committed suicide because she was so upset about the pictures of herself in a compromising position which were going around via mobile phones and on the  We've also heard about the particular problems of suicide in prisons and young offenders... Young offenders' institutions. But I wanted to talk a little bit about men and suicide. Some members were tentative in trying to explore why it should be that men are three times more likely to take their own lives than women. And that in men  suicide is the second most common cause of death in  and clearly a particular issue in Northern Ireland. During  suicide rates in young men aged 15 to 24 reached an all-  They were at their highest since the 1920s. Research by both the British Medical Journal and Mind show that during times of  the mental health of men is put at particular risk. Mind's YouGov survey found almost 40 % of men are worried or low at the  And the top three issues playing on their minds of job  work and money. Unemployment has been identified in the report to as increasing the risk of suicide amongst men under 35 years who have been out of work. It was in a period of workless this that they took the wrong life. The chief-executive of Mind has said, the recession is clearly having a detrimental impact on the nation's mental health. But men in particular are struggling with the emotional impact. Being a breadwinner is something that is crucial to the male psyche. So if a man loses his job, he loses a large part of his identity, putting his mental well-being in jeopardy. The  and this has been referred to, that too many men wrongly believe that admitting mental distress makes them weak. And this kind of stigma can cost Social factors are felt particularly strongly by both young men and led aged men, and particularly for middle-aged men, financial problems can cause feelings of shame and hopelessness, and can feel impossible to overcome. I would also like 2.2 issues around a group that has not been mentioned, this is young men and women in the lesbian and gay community. There is evidence that 50% of lesbian or transsexual women had attempted  and I think we need to look at the particular needs of that group in relation to mental health and suicide. The government has published a strategy preventing suicide in England, across government outcomes, strategy to  the two key aims are to reduce the suicide rates, and to support people affected by suicide. It does not make specific recommendations, so it will be up to clinical commissioning groups, and local directors of public health to take action in local  I hope this debate in the House will flag up the concern about the issue. There is an issue about spending. Moving to a close, I would like to point out Labour's record on mental health, we made important progress earlier on, we made a mental health one of our top three clinical priorities, and spent over 1 billion more during  That is a real terms increase of 25%. We believe, and this is why my honourable friend for Leeds has taken up this issue, there is no it question that if you make impact in mental health issues, you make an impact and the proper  -- on the problem. Labour would like to see more work done on internet safety, both on bullying, and those sides which tragically and sadly help young people to find out about suicide, and encouraging copycat suicides. We want to we write the NHS constitution to give people the same legal rights on mental illness. We want to insure training for staff on the NHS includes mental health. -- ensure. We have to realise is not just an issue for the NHS, bring together education and the police to work with businesses and employers. That is why Ed Miliband has announced a strategic plan for mental health in society by a task group, chaired by Stephen O'Brien, the chairman of the Bart's NHS Trust. Let me say  we have heard of the particular problem in Northern  and it is sad to think that there is a generation living almost with a traumatic disorder in the aftermath of the Troubles. I congratulate my friends in the Dee pee all bringing this issue to the  -- DUP. Every suicide is an individual tragedy, every suicide is not amenable to anything that government might do. There will also be a two people, exactly the  whose face -- faced with precisely the same circumstances, will choose different parts. We can do something about the therapies and mental health services, we can do something to support families, and to sustain them, and when I say  I don't just mean a man  I mean the very varied families we find in our society. We can do more to support families and communities, we can do more to support a grieving families, and we can do our very best as a house to ensure that day by day, and year by  there are fewer people feeling that they have nothing worth living for. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is good to follow the Shadow Minister in an excellent presentation that she has given. There have been a number of points that have been raised today by honourable members in the issue of  When we look at the  it is a startling reminder of just how serious this issue of suicide is in society today. Right across the whole of the United  England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there were 6045 people dying of suicide in  In Northern Ireland, we have had an increase in suicide figures from the year 2000 right until the end of 2012 somewhere in the region 000 people. 2012, it is estimated by the final figures are completed that we will be close to 300 people who have died of suicide. The first nine months were 223. Those are startling figures. It has also been mentioned numerous times  and I don't think we can mention it enough, the awful impact that this has on families. It is terrific when those of us who are members have to go to homes and give our sympathy to loved ones who have lost even a child or an older person of through suicide. Whilst  and we do, because we go to pay our sympathy, but we can walk out of our house again, and go back and spend time with our own  Those people have to live there be day-in and day-out. --  The questions have to  why did it happen?

There is nothing so serious that we can't sit down and talk about it, and resolve the outstanding issues. Issues to let that individual who died Bristol -- died through  it might not have been as big an issue as they thought.

I deal with an organisation called the Yellow  run by a Dr Arthur Cassidy, and some fantastic volunteers.

Whilst that has been a large amounts of money put in, we heard from the honourable member from Belfast  talking about the figure of £30 million. Yet, with all that  there still seems to be a rise in the situation within Northern Ireland. That is a very worrying issue. We have heard references made it to the legacy of the Troubles, and the difficulties in the province, and we have another generation who won our living with what has happened in , and maybe their parents have died in the same way.

It is also a problem that is gradually able to express itself a bit more. Reference was made to the fact that it has been a taboo subject. I can recall the first time I heard of suicide was when I was in primary  A family friend committed  this would have been in  A great friend of my  she was great to all my brothers and sisters whenever we went to her shop. But I remember that my mother's distress as a friend wasn't just all the usual questions that we now know about about suicide and the loss of a lovely friend. It was also because at that time she was denied a Christian burial and denied the rights of her own church. That is what taboo meant then. Luckily, churches have become more enlightened and many people have helped them to become more  So we can celebrate that spiritual enlightenment can inform churches in different ways, and they can treat the weight they respond to something big class as a sin can change and develop, and that has been very positive. That has helped all of us as a community in many ways. I found the debate hard because I have agreed with many of the points. I felt many of  I have experienced suicide in my family more than once. suicide in my family more than once. from people that have been regarded as close all good friends or family friends or whatever.

But there has been a strong community response to that. The Western Health and Social Care Trust has tried to engage it strongly on it.
